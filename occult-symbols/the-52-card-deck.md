### intro

tonight pastor aaron began a new series on tarot cards which quite piqued my interest. he was talking about how the 52 playing card deck is just a simplified version of the tarot cards -- or rather that the tarot card deck was just a deck of playing cards, which later, upon realisation that the images on the cards were symbolic, tturned into a way for one to intutively hook into this symbolism as a mechanism for achieving or knowing your journey to inner divinity.

### structure

the cards contain 4 suits which correspond to the four elements. they are:

1. fire (wands) - magic, desire, ambition
2. air (swords) - thought
3. water (cups) - relationships, transitions
4. earth (pentacles) - the human condition, real stuff

the cards also contain 4 status cards:

1. page (ace) - initiate
2. knight (jack) - level 1
3. queen (queen) - level 2, high priestess, feminine aspect
4. king (king) - level 3, mastery

### my take on this as a tarot card deck

first, the four suits seem to correspond quite nicely to the 4 primary planes of perception:

1. clubs (wands) - desire
2. spades (swords) - structure
3. hearts (cups) - emotional/conceptual
4. diamond (pentacles) - physical

next, the status cards will remain the same, however the ace will also function as a 0 card for each suit. each suit will represent the trumps (triumphs) over the previous for that plane of perception. their order is as follows:

- ace (0) initiate
- 10
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7
- 8
- 9
- ace (the 11th) master

the ace fulfills the lowest form of perecption to becoming the final form upon attainment of its mastery. for example, in the hearts suit, the ace card is a picture of a guy continually chasing a forever fleeting good feeling. as the lowest form of perception, this is considered addiction -- always, needing a quick fix from something ot feel better. however, upon mastery, instead of chasing, you're being lead by the good feeling. similarly you achieve it, and is always fleeting, but instead of that being a bad thing, instead this is what makes it fun, and attainment of this is evidence of the mastery which you're looking to attain.

the 10 card is put in the 1 position on purpose, because 1 + 0 = 1, and the first card on the journey to mastery is alwas the illusion that you have attained it, when you really haven't. the journey always begins with a false sense of attainment. have you ever wondered how a 1st grader coming home from school, thinks that after learning addition, is now the smartest kid in the world and has accomplished everything there is to learn about maths?

the 2-9 cards correspond to the numerically significant attribute of that plane of perception. 2 perception through duality, three is perception through harmony, etc.

the status cards, jack, queen, king are to show the aspect. jack is subordinate masculine, queen is the female principle of order and structure, and king is the masculine perinciple of ownership, rulership, and power.

# introduction

society is organised in such a way that you (the person) are as powerless as possible. everyone has an agenda for you. the people running the network don't want you to be able to control your mind. facebook doesn't want you to have control of your data. unless you have a lot of money, you have very little control over what is happening in your reality.

the only control you really have is over yourself. these different suits represent the different qualities of these forms of perception which are vital to their understanding allowing you to regain control over your perception (or, if you're creating a new timeline, these may give an idea of how to keep people from that control)

the only person that can make the decision to want to have this control is you. no one else can do it for you. the way that I arrived to this understanding is a bit of a funny one.

I was emotionally very distressed with some things that I could not logically figure out (because they were emotion based, so no amount of logic could explain the way I felt or the victimisation that I felt to my unfortunate circumstances). I have always been a pretty addictive person, and all of my life I've been pretty addicted to feeling good, so at the time I couldn't find any other way to placate the emotional distress than to drink and use a lot of cocaine. most people party on coke, but I used it as an escape from my emotional distress allowing me to program and feel good again. separately, I also had a drinking problem because alcohol made me superficial and stupid enough to no longer perceive the growing and already massive problems that were around me, as actual problems. they appeared to me as funny things -- you know stuff that you think is funny, because alcohol makes awful behaviour appear funny, until the reality of it sets in and you break down into tears.

anyway, I knew I had a problem, and up until then the way I got out of problems was to focus on my creativity, so I began to program a lot while using a lot of coke. I drank still, but because I didn't like to drink and do coke, my drinking slowed down. coke allowed me to program like a madman, and it's a lot of fun at the same time. it's expensive though and I was quickly running out of money.

my coke dealer recommended me to switch to MDMA, telling me that it was a great replacement. I tried it and slept on it. later a friend gave me much more pure stuff and that's when I really began to change. the MDMA replaced the good feeling that I was getting from the coke and allowed me to essentially quit drinking for a little while. if the MDMA didn't replace the good feeling the other substances were giving me and give me the relief from the emotional distress, it wouldn't have been so successful.

MDMA truly is a wonderful thing, allowing me the capability of repreceiving the past experiences that were causing me emotional distress in a new way. their impact seemed to fade as they became things that just sort of happened, and less these big complicated things that I logically felt like I needed to understand and try to fix. in that sense, I could tell that the drug was making me "stupid" or "naïve" again as I no longer seemed to want to try and understand these things (you have to know something amout me: I *must* understand everything in my reality. if I don't understand it, it causes me huge distress and I spin my wheels undlessly trying to figure it out) -- so, to all of a sudden no longer be concerned with trying to logically understand and figure out my situation was a huge departure from my normal behaviour. I didn't feel like it was a problem. I assumed that I would return back to normal logical operation.

I smoked so much MDMA, it really took me a whole lot longer to come back to normal logical operation, but the process is what the point of this whole story is about. I ran out of money, so I no longer had the financial capability to purchase another substance to make me feel good. I really wanted to feel like I felt when I was smoking MDMA, and I was sure that I could do it, because the mushroom was my guide and showed me that I was master of my perception. I really believed that I could, without MDMA, figure out how to feel that good, without the drug.

that's when I decided that, no matter the circumstances, I wanted to find a way to feel good -- to find a way to feel like I felt on MDMA, where my probems no longer had emotional control over me. the decision, I would say, was the decision to *want* to feel good. you really have to want to feel good, and like a bad addiction, feel like you will do anything necessary to get that good feeling again.. that was the most important choice I ever made.

the world is a funny place and it's funny how I'm kind of the centrepoint of this whole network thing in the way that these guys *do not* want you to have control over your perception. they want to be in control of that, and I think it's quite an ok think, because once you learn you have all of the power, their influence makes very little difference to you.

they can modify all sorts of things in your physical experience, manipulating all sorts of organs in your body electronically, but if you decide how you want to feel they cannot control that. physical and emotional conscious reality is all about learning to become receptive to the things you want or interest you, and let the other stuff kind of fade away (kind of like how you would feel on a high dose of MDMA listening to some invigorating music). so, when you gain control of how you feel, you regain control of your physical reality.

- emotional reality trumps physical reality.
- thought reality trumps emotional reality.
- and, the things that you desire, or the things that interest you, do indeed trump your thought reality.

so yes, it would appear that if you could control one's desires you can control your reality. that idea is a bit buddhist though, and I do not believe controlling is necesessarily the best word here. to illustrate, take thought and emotion. even though though does trump emotion, you can think your way into a better feeling place -- however, when you feel bad, it's hard to think thoughts that feel good. your thoughts, when feeling bad, will almost always make you feel about the same, or worse. this is why I strongly advocate the utilisation of an external stimulous such as drugs, sex or music to put your mind in a different place, allowing you the freedom to think new thoughts.

so, in a sense, emotion also trumps thought as well. they work together in a way which is designed such that one amplifies the other, which is really great when it's a subject you want amplified.. however, if it's not a subject you want ampilified, you'll notice these two create a rapidly spiraling vortex downward toward self-destruction. so, figure out how to use your drugs/sex/music to achive the effect you want it to have; simple as that.

this deck is designed to give perceptive awareness to these different forms of perception, ultimately giving you back the power create or destroy yourself in the way you see fit.
