### intro

tonight pastor aaron began a new series on tarot cards which quite piqued my interest. he was talking about how the 52 playing card deck is just a simplified version of the tarot cards -- or rather that the tarot card deck was just a deck of playing cards, which later, upon realisation that the images on the cards were symbolic, tturned into a way for one to intutively hook into this symbolism as a mechanism for achieving or knowing your journey to inner divinity.

### structure

the cards contain 4 suits which correspond to the four elements. they are:

1. fire (wands) - magic, desire, ambition
2. air (swords) - thought
3. water (cups) - relationships, transitions
4. earth (pentacles) - the human condition, real stuff

the cards also contain 4 status cards:

1. page (ace) - initiate
2. knight (jack) - level 1
3. queen (queen) - level 2, high priestess, feminine aspect
4. king (king) - level 3, mastery

### my take on this as a tarot card deck

first, the four suits seem to correspond quite nicely to the 4 primary planes of perception:

1. clubs (wands) - desire
2. spades (swords) - structure
3. hearts (cups) - emotional/conceptual
4. diamond (pentacles) - physical

next, the status cards will remain the same, however the ace will also function as a 0 card for each suit. each suit will represent the trumps (triumphs) over the previous for that plane of perception. their order is as follows:

- ace (0) initiate
- 10
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7
- 8
- 9
- ace (the 11th) master

the ace fulfills the lowest form of perecption to becoming the final form upon attainment of its mastery. for example, in the hearts suit, the ace card is a picture of a guy continually chasing a forever fleeting good feeling. as the lowest form of perception, this is considered addiction -- always, needing a quick fix from something ot feel better. however, upon mastery, instead of chasing, you're being lead by the good feeling. similarly you achieve it, and is always fleeting, but instead of that being a bad thing, instead this is what makes it fun, and attainment of this is evidence of the mastery which you're looking to attain.

the 10 card is put in the 1 position on purpose, because 1 + 0 = 1, and the first card on the journey to mastery is alwas the illusion that you have attained it, when you really haven't. the journey always begins with a false sense of attainment. have you ever wondered how a 1st grader coming home from school, thinks that after learning addition, is now the smartest kid in the world and has accomplished everything there is to learn about maths?

the 2-9 cards correspond to the numerically significant attribute of that plane of perception. 2 perception through duality, three is perception through harmony, etc.

the status cards, jack, queen, king are to show the aspect. jack is subordinate masculine, queen is the female principle of order and structure, and king is the masculine perinciple of ownership, rulership, and power.
