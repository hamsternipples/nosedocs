#### why do you guys often times, when talking about the emotional scale, skip over contentment or satisfaction and jump right into hope or belief?

when in spain, I often times used "fuck it" for the middle of the scale. it is a bit telling that I would use that expression considering where I was at, at the time. however, I have begun to think that there is another dimension to this emotional scale. if one end of the x-axis is depression or despair and the other end is exhilaration and appreciation, it would seem to me that there is potentially also a y-axis as well. beginning to move into positivity from a feeling of "fuck it", surrender, or giving up, is VERY DIFFERENT than beginning from contentment, which is also very different from satisfaction. can you please explain more?
