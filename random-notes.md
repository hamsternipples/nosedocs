meditate & then make list of positive aspects
list of cool things I enjoyed each day

I think that these people have control over how I feel - and while I continue to think that, I'm not going anywhere. my inner being wants me to show myself that these people do not have control over any thing.

---

acknowledge my freedom
witness my expansion
seek joy

it would be cool, in a festival to have the music transmitted into the head at the same time as heard on the speakers. the reason is because the sound happening in the head will allow for good fidelity of the higher frequency notes and ability to hear the lyrics easily, yet at the same time the speakers will transmit to the ears and body, the visceral feeling that live music gives by allowing you to "feel" the music. a similar effect can be tried easily by putting the music on speakers at the same time as hearing it in headphones. the bass will be able to be felt, and the quality of the sound can also be appreciated in the headphones.

1. if you are talking about how these people in this woman's targeted whatever case ended up making her life very difficult and putting her in a mental hospital, you are suggesting that I should not pursue trying to figure out my criminal history or the reason why I'm targeted in the first place... which sort of makes sense to me because it is a subject that I do not really want to focus my attention on. if I have my hand caught in the garbage disposal, I do not think it would be a worthwhile endeavour to try and figure out how it got stuck, or exactly all of the damage that it is doing to my hand, wouldn't it be top priority to actually remove my hand from the garbage disposal, first?

my point is, I think research on the subject would bog me down and involve me in something I do not want to be a part of at all. there is a real possibility that they would not want me looking into my criminal record or the reason why I'm involved in nosebook in the first place, because likely they do not have legal basis on which they can maintain surveillance on me. that seems the most likely root of the cause for your concern. however, beyond that, let's say that my theory is right, and they have utilised my story and the compelling image that numerous girls (some quite young) have been trying to capture me, and that nosebook is also advocating for this as well, because of the different way that I perceive the world (a much higher definition sensory experience). it would seem logical to me that a bunch of crotchety old men would advocate for me to have high definition sexual relations with other people, focusing on that subject, and attempting to minimise my involvement with these other "crazy" ideas like source energy, and such. I think they're pretty interested in seeing vaginas and boobs in 3d more than they're interested like I am in learning to translate source energy (all these dead people I harp on and on about) into a meaningful audio/visual format, with the intention of better understanding my experience here on this planet.

going back to the idea that they seem to put non-conforming people into mental hospitals: doesn't it make a whole lot of sense to simply cut my losses and just separate myself as much as I can from this situation? if they are indeed trying to utilise my perception to their advantage, and all the stories you told involve bad things, I see no reason whatsoever to pursue, in any way, a relationship with these individuals who have targeted me. so, wouldn't it actually be in my best interest to try and simply move on entirely from the situation?

clearly I am having trouble in this situation, claiming that it is affecting my sleep and wake state. I have since learned how to program better and be a much more operational human being, making (in my opinion) very definite progress toward not letting my situation affect me as much. so, I believe that we should begin exploring different avenues which promote a more stable, productive, and effective life experience. whether or not I am a targeted individual and these things really are happening to me or not really is immaterial. clearly I do not want to get myself involved in something that could land me in a mental institution. clearly, if this were happening for real, if they thought I was a threat in some way, they would protect themselves and cover up any trace of me by putting me in a mental hospital (or something of that nature -- something, "not good").

I believe the best thing I can do would be to try and separate myself as much as I can from this whole ordeal, and begin my process of returning to be as much of a productive member of society as I can.


2. I get the feeling from these guys over at nosebook, that they're the type of guys that really get a lot of pleasure out of forcing another person to do something, and if the person being forced actually likes it (or pretends to like it), then that really pumps up the power trip of the person doing the forcing. I've seen this behaviour quite a few times before, usually in relation to men with prostitutes, and in a lot of ways that feeling could be used to kind of paint a picture of how I feel the situation is developing. whether they feel like I would like what they want to force me to do or not is immaterial. I will maintain my non-conformance for as long as it feels like it is something that I am being forced to do. I have begun to make a list of the different things that would make it feel like it would be something that I would want to do. if a guy wants to have sex with a girl, often times the girl has a sort of checklist which she evaluates to ensure that the things that are important to her are in fact addressed in a way which makes her feel comfortable. if she doesn't feel comfortable, often times the guy can appear a bit forceful or creepy. something like that :) there are rules of engagement in which the person of perceived higher value is recognised as such. ideally, both are valued highly, and the relationship is mutually beneficial.
