## autobiograpgy of kenneth bentley




    "we don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents" - bob ross




dedicated to heather, because one day we talked about how she had felt something really amazing for herself. I told her I too had also had some crazy experiences that made me feel something similar. I encouraged her telling her that it *is* a real thing, and becasuse she felt it so strongly, universe wants to prove that feeling as she felt it to be, if she'll let it (something like that... revisit!).

also, I want to additionally achnoledge riann for prompting me to make an autobiography. withoug that, I would have never written such a thing -- and also for bringing such intuitive and inspiring content to the various brain injury group meetings.

### forward

when I promised riann that I would write an autobiography, I told her I would do it from the perspective of hemisphere that had the brain injury (the right one). however, after some thought, I decided against this format because I would have to make up a whole lot. I simply do not have access to my other hemisphere anymore. I am certain that that there are a lot of people who interact with that hemmisphere, and could much more accurately tell what that personality is like...

so, because I don't really know what my other personality is like, I have instead decided to write the autobiogragraphy more from a perspective of discovery of what that personality is really like. I still have yet to really know, so it'll be interesting.

usually, an autobiography is written near the end of someone's life, to kind of summarise the experience that person has gained; I consider this a fun idea, because I somewhat intuitively believe this kinda similar to what is in fact happening -- and so, to some extent, it will summarise the discoveries I have made in the process of all of this from kenny's perspective kind of like an end-of-life sort of reflection on it all.

I feel as if I am going to eventually become conscious in this other personality; how soon, I don't know, but I do feel as if I am approaching the end of my consciousness through the perspective of kenny. it'll probably overtake the one I'm currently conscious in and because it'll be so much more different than the road I took to get there, I believe all of these sorts of past things that I'm going to talk about will no longer be relevant to me in an experiential sense, and their memory will become something of such a distant thing, kinda like childhood memories.

however, I don't really know what to expect either, because the guy you guy conscious in my dream state may be completely different than I am. I just don't really know -- and neither do I really want to put too many expectations. so, I have decided it would be the best "mistake" to write this from the most nitty gritty perspective from which I am still conscious right now, as if I am retelling the journey I took to discovering this new personality that is beginning to take over.

not all of the information will be factual, because I simply cannot be hassled anymore to try and work out what really happened exactly -- and I'm not concerned very much with the details, either; because, in the end, the only thing that matters is, the concept that remains in your mind from the experience -- that is, how you feel about the whole thing. that feeling can (and should) be modified pretty easily by redefining what things mean in the memory to change how it feels (or rather the concept associated with it).

I have done a lot of that redefinition, so details may not be very accurate. sorry about that. also, even though I am writing this in a sort of end-of-life sort of perspective, this is also only a bit of a snapshot my present state. I will likely continue to refine and redefine my definition of myself, so all of this is, in my perspective already outdated.

### **chapter one** :: a dramatic change of pace

on april 04, 2000 I had a brain haemorrhage in the part of my brain that affects my movement. I lost the ability to move the left side of my body. it was a weird experience because I was in the citrus college gym in glendora doing some non-at-all trenuuous weight lifting. I was on the machine where you straddle a bunch and push some pads forward. when I got up, I suddenly felt lighter, but it didn't feel like anything was wrong. I think I lost consciousness for a second even though I vaguely remember falling over to my left. I next remember myself on the ground and some people were around me trying to figure out why I was laying on the ground. I remember very clearly that I didn't thing anything was the matter. I felt fine, and I don't remember any pain in the moment either.

it was the weirdest thing because I couldn't really determine anything was the matter. even though I was laying on the ground, I didn't think much of it. I didn't really think anything was wrong. however, I started to become conscious of my situation as I realised I couldn't move my left-side. it was the weirdest thing because I was moving it, and it seemed to be moving, yet when I actually looked with my eyes, it took me a second to notice that my body hadn't actually moved, even though it "looked" like it had moved.

I didn't realise this until much later, but when you send the brain impulse to move your body, your body doesn't actually move until a few milliseconds later than when you first thought about moving your body, however, instantly in my mind I could see and feel my body moving. I used to move my body first in my imaagination, and then my body would follow suit.

so, when I noticed that my body had not physically moved, I started to become a bit concerned about things. I just didn't really understand what had happened, and why things were'nt working the way they were supposed to, however I didn't fear death and had a strong sense that things were all right. I really believe the only concern I felt was actually transmitted to me from the people attending to me.

they put me on a helicopter and sent me to the hospital. they wanted to make sure I was lucid so the woman in the helicopter told me to remember two words: sarah and blue, to make sure I was not brain damaged or something.. I thought this was a complete waste of time because I knew I was fine, so I played along. she asked me other dumb questions like who the president was and stuff like that too. I just remember people were running around acting very very concerned. I didn't feel that way at all and it was really bothering me so I kept trying to tell everyone that it was all ok and be as calm and conscious as I could possibly be.

it was all very surreal to me because I felt extremely calm and not at all concerned. people told me that I wasn't going to be able to have full motor function ever again, but that didn't bother me. instead, I was thankful that I had gotton to experience all sorts of great things prior to losing my motor capability.

I have this "problem" since forever; I can't remember not having this, and that is that I've always perceived myself as invincible. prior to this experience I was EXTREMELY DEPRESSED. I couldn't possibly imagine that this is what life was amounting to. I perceived everything as superficial and completely devoid of any meaning whatsoever. I was supposed to like girls and stuff, but they horrified me with their superficiality. I really wanted to occupy myself with something that I didn't consider superficial[^1]. I didn't realise this yet, but you always perceive the things you want to change about yourself, in others -- so I thought girls were superficial and stupid, and I couldn't imagine that this is what life was all about[^2]. it was really me that was superficial and stupid -- but invincible. I knew things would be fine.

I drifted in and out of consciousness for quite a while. I remember that I used to "fly" around inside of the hospital trying to imagine what down the hallway looked like, or what sort of weather was outside. I really was growing quite tired of the hospital situation and wanted to get out. I think because of my thankful attitude and my desire to leace the hospital, I began making rapid progress and was beginning to move my left-side again. it looked like I was going to be able to leave soon.

I noticed my head was leaking fluid though, and this was something that they seemed pretty concerned with. I had a tube coming out of my head that was draining this golden coloured oil that smelled quite strange out into a bag beside my bed. at first it was really bloody, but then it became that golden coloured thing. it was kinda sticky too. it would begin leaking out of my head where the tube attached and I noticed it because it was very conducive to "feeling" the cold aire conditioer air blowing on it. I would reach back and feel it all over the pillow and my partially shaved head. it got everywhere and made the hair that I still had feel extremely gross.

later on, it turns out, that was a big deal because they decided that, because it wasn't draining properly, to install a pipe under my skin to let the CSF drain out of my head and into my stomach cavity. they didn't know it was infected though. to make matters worse, the surgery required to install that caused me to lose all of the movement I had regained in my left-side.

I suffered a terrible time with a staph infection in my lungs before they realised my CSF was infected. they put me on some really high pewered antibiotics and removed the shunt. once again I lost the mobility I had regained in my left-side.

I rexexber that mom would come to read this book to me called "left behind". I also remember her, very distinctly telling me that I had begun to revert back to my old self. she also told me somewhere in there too, "told you so: you're not invincible". these events were memorable to me because I was still struggling with that depression I mentioned earlier.

I don't remember when exactly it happened, and it may have been even as late as after the removal of the shunt, but I really wanted to know what is the reason why I'm here, why am I being punished to endure such a superficial and lifeless world that almost as if it were an answer to prayer, I was met by a radiant being which I knew instantly to be jesus. I had no doubt in my mind that whatever this was about, I wanted to do that. I really did *not* want to be performing the ritual of superficial living. I wanted to be a part of whatever that was...

it's hard to describe that feeling. I was calmly agreeing in my mind, but my feelings were jumping out of my skin because I was sooooo tired of all the boring superficiality of material-oriented and church/christian-performance style living, not to mention that this is quite possibly the most radiant -- you just don't say no to something that impactful -- you know... it's like if life was in greyscale, and then all of a sudden in the presence of whatever this is, everything is now in full vibrant colour. I don't have any hesitation, you know; this is exactly what I was waiting for!

[1]: later on, I moved to spain to work on a social network called "tuenti" -- where once again I was confronted with my deep hatred for the superficiality of women. I'll talk more about it soon, but I wanted to note the echos of the past as a reoccurring theme to be undersood from a LOA perspective.

[2]: we don't really have a concept now about this, because of how much things have changed since: this was a year and a half before before the sept 11 attacks, and life was really different back then. befere the 9/11 reality-check, people were really off in lala-land.

### **chapter two** :: things leading up to, and probably influenced the event, considerably

like I mentioned, I always consedered myself to be invincible, but more than that I had some sort of crazy no resistance to want to do the most extreme sort of things. I was actually the biggest paradox in this sort of way, because when it came to physical things like skydiving or stuff like that, I had no fear whatsoever, yet at the same time, I had real difficulty taking the trash out at night. I really believed that monsters or "badguys" were hiding behind the trash can or in the trees just waiting to jump out and harm me. I was terribly frightened of monsters and poisenous animals and the dark and stuff -- yet ask me if I wanted to go down a steep slope on my bike, and if I felt ok doing it, I was fine. the times where I did crash, it was always my own fault and I came away without any injury. in fact, now that I think about it, I can't really remember a time anyone had ever injured me that I didn't ask them to.. it feels to me like I have been 100% responsible for all of my own injuries. that may or may not be factually true, but that's the way it feels now.

anyway, I also never had any fear to try out things that were preceived to be over my difficulty level, cause I always had this idea that I would just figure it out. so, except for my imagination, I was pretty fearless. because my imagination caused me so much distress, I eventually had enough of it and shut it down. I didn't like feeling fear like that to just taking out the trash. it deeply concerned me that I was so scared of the dark when I logically *knew* there wasn't really anything out there to harm me. I couldn't break the fear though.

----------rework! (fear of the dark was actually worse before the hospital. I know the fear was directly related to my thoughts being around end of the world style thinking -- and christian fear sort of stuff)
another thing to note is that I *loved* the book of revelation. I can't really remember being scared of the "end times" -- but I did have this fantasy of being a star player in the "end times" that were surely upon us shortly. I remember -- don't remember how young I was -- but reading the book of revelation and deciding that I wanted to be one of the two witnesses. I had a very strong impression that I was. I kept it to myself and went along wondering who the second one would be... I wondered if it would be a boy or a girl and I wondered what sort of things would happen. I knew the book of revelation was alegorical like dreams usually are, so it wasn't to be taken literally. I knew that it said that they would die in front of the whole world, and they would lay there for the whole world te see for 3.5 years. for some reason that didn't bother me at all. I just liked the idea of having the power to call down plagues and stuff, lol. I was a lot different than I am now, and back then I was really enthralled with "power". all the things I wanted to create in my head would give me more power. I loved guns and all sorts of warfare. my goal was to optimise it such, and would often fantasise, that no one could stop me. I was unstoppable. in my own mind, I was completely invincible -- yet in reality, I was a nerdy kid that was still scared of the dark.
------------rework!
I know now why it was so difficult for me to break that silly fear. when I was younger, I would live in my imagination, creating different inventions and stuff. I would imagine flying things, and all sorts of stuff that would be fun or cool to have. however, later on, and I think this had a large bit to do with the "left behind" series mom read to me in the hospital, my imagination was refocused to begin imagining the "end times" -- when the earth would be plunged into terrible difficulty. my imagination had been

it wasn't only after the hospital though, because I remember when I was maybe 12-13, I got really interested in this guy named john titor. he was a time traveller that claimed he was fetching something for some major event that was going to happen in 2038. he fascinated me tremendously and got me to begin thinking about timelines[^1]. these greatly influenced me to begin thinking about, if there are many diffeerent timelines, what makes one conscious on one over another?
------------rework!

[1]: he called them world lines though, probably because if you could imagine tuning into a future version of something -- well, first imagine you're going to tune into something in the present on the other side of the world. you would, using the positional space inside of the "capacitor" to tune into a specific position (or, know the position of some device resonating at the same frequency).. well, if you could imagine doing this inside of the "capacitor" of the sun or galaxy, you could tune into something of the past by tuning into its relative position in the past, instead of the present. that is, the position of the world in the past, or "worldline". it's very unlikely that anything ever passes through the same spot in space because so many things are in motion at once, and it seems to me line, just like we experience notable influence when passing through venus' tail, here inside of the heliosphere, I could imagine that if our solar system were to ever pass through the tail of another solar system at the galaactic level, it may be quite an influential event as well. eg. the worldline may be different than the helioline. I dunno just speculation on my part here...

### **chapter three** :: the fractal soliton of improbability

later on in my life, again I can't really remember when it was exactly but I'm pretty suhe I was in spain by then, but I became very interested in terence mckenna. I was doing a lot of psychedelics and I began to have very strange events occur that had to do with time. there was one story he told which particularly caught my attention...

Terence K. McKenna (1986) Rites of spring

"one of the weird things about growth, or trying to make your ideas always become new, is that you assume that you always know what the next step is -- that even though you're going to become more and more enlightened, there won't be any more surprises..."

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l34adiLycGY)

besides the whole bunch of other bizarre ideas I had conjured about myself being one of the two witnesses, some strange events interacting with time travelers when I was in berlin and conversing with a guy named "former white hat" (which seemed very interested in me), I could only just add this on to the list of very strange things that seemed to be influencing me.

when I found out that terence died at nearly the same time that I had a brain haemorrhage, I *really* became interested. I was so overtaken by the emotion of the moment, I sent rupert sheldrake a *very weird* email about it.

some time around then, and I can't at all remember the order of the events, but there were three of them: 1. I was smoking a bunch of mdma when an elderly lady gave me some acid. when I took it, I heard this guy's music that I had been listening to called, "tale of two earths" and I "saw" a future version of myself. he had long hair that seemed to contineously flow with the invisible wind going through it, and I noted that there were all sorts of girls accompanying him. they didn't ever say anything or interact with me, but they were just sort of there hanging out with him.

the second was an event where at the height of some mdma smoking, I suddenly had this reality transformation where I had this sudden realisatin that *I* was jesus... I didn't really believe it at first, and I remember it took a lot of convincing with these very abstract scenes (I have no visuals), given to me as evidence of the feeling that was impressed to strongly upon me.

I then felt as if I should write a poem about it all. I wrote a poem which I modified numerous times to try and make it feel better.

```
dear baby jesus
sovereign lord I pray
come fourth within me

    ---

open up my heart
and blow my mind so
that I might unfold this day
into things, still unseen

		---

right, so wherever you are
oh mighty one, within me
come fourth and play

		. . .

entice my soul; invigorate her
and awaken her from her sleep
so we might guide my ways together
so that all might see

		---

maintain your modesty, though
and hide yourself within me
humble me so

		. . .

yeah, but don't crimp my style bro
you probably forget how embarrassing it is,
everytime you pretend, you're really not me

		---

you're still hiding,
veiled behind the beauty of my skin, so, I command
you to rise from your folly, rejecting your rainment
which is me, you will present yourself to the world in nakedness
I need to see it to believe it; that is, that christ really is,
is me?

 - wonderfully remade in the image of God
```

the third crazy event was one where again, at the height of a mdma smokeout, I received some crazy symbols of the future. just as I had been instructed by the time travelers I interacted with in berlin, I was to put these symbols on to paper so that when people focused on them, they would attract the symbolic representation of these future symbols.

the first was a picture divided into half. the left side pictured a very stressed out man, and the right side had a little girl on it. these corresponded to the two hemispheres of my brain.

the second one was a picture of me with a large vortex surrounding me with with a caption saying, "this is my reality" and an indicator that my two hemispheres had been balanced by the caption saying (in spanish): it is done.

the third one, I have a beard. this is to signify older age or a lot of time had passed or that I'm back back to being a sort of hermit type. in that picture, I am presenting to the world (in the style that tesla does when he makes his demonstrations) and I say, "this is a machine capable of desire" -- and some peeple marveling at its greatness.

---

ok, so back now to the fractal soliton of improbability. when I heard it, I knew exactly what it was. he says that the time split occured at either the immaculate conception or the resurrection. I don't think it's either. I believe it was some event which was left out of the bible, likely because it had something to do with girls that snowballed into what resulted in his death. somehow, jesus lost his belief in himself. the week leading up to his death, there were a number of weird things that happened, which kind of shows he has lost his connction. following his "celebration"[^1] entrance into jerusalem on palm sunday. then on monday, he follors it up with what I believe to be his biggest mistake of turning the tables in the temple[^2], then cursed a fig tree cause it wasn't bearing fruit on his way out[^4].

my understanding of this "soliton of improbability" has transformed quite a bit over the years, and it'll likely continue to do so. I will give my current understanding of it all. timeline splits happen all the time. in fact, every time that you wake up, your timeline splits. when you go back to sleep, you get reinegrated into the timeline with which you share the most affinity. what terence is talking about, is an event that generates such strong desire for something to more than one way, that consciousness remains on the timeline where your desire or expectations reside.

the reason why there is a "good" timeline and a "bad" timeline can only be understood by understanding law of attraction. whenever you have a "manifestation" of what's wanted, you slow down as you settle into that manifestation. however, to understand the reason why this soliton of improbability has such a dramatic impact on a timeline is because it's moving so fast. it is, quite literally, the fastest "particle" in the universe.

if you're trying to go the fastest, then the manifestation is not what you're looking for -- or rather, the manifestation should be something wanted, but it shouldn't be the entirety of what's wanted. it should be mostly unwanted in order to continually go faster. the way that LOA works is that any time you are pereceiving something unwanted, it generates in you desire for what is wanted. so, the goal for this soliton is to make a manifestation which generates perception of unwanted at the most rapid rate possible.

at easy way to perceive this will be to take my experience with tuenti. prior to the experience I had been giving a lot of thought into what the ideal social network would be like. I had also come from a quite a difficult time coming to terms with the superficiality of people, but women specifically. I simply could not understand what inspired these hot women to continually reward deadbeat dudes with their affection. I also could not understand why they seemed to be most attracted to the guys that had absolutely no thought to the way the universe works (the superficial ones). it really bothered me a lot that the guys that were actually doing the main amount of work were left to fend for theirselves, and the egotistical morons got all of the attention.

I later figured this out, because women kind of lead the direction of the next phase of human development, even if it's a bit misguided at first (no fault of theirs, they're usually following what feels good). as soon as I gave up trying to figure that bit out, I began realising that "dudes need theme songs" -- a reference to one of the experiences with my future self -- where they were not actually rewarding superficiality, but rewarding confidence, individuality, and selfishness. these are all things that, as I began to really understand these concepts for myself, because these were qualities that they really wanted to see in men, and was the beginning of the sign of the coming age. although these men were not the correct realisation of it yet, and I felt like social dynamics kind of expected dudes to deceive the women into thinking that they were more individualistic and not a bunch of followers and group thinkers like the rest -- but, they probably were more in the direction if what was wanted, each of them, through the hardships of a bunch of broken relationships, putting more desire into their vertexes for what they really wanted.

so, here I am working on tuenti and I have this sort of hatred for women in the sense that they loved these egotistical boneheads over guys who do real work, when I find myself in a situation that is probably the most extreme version of that. spanish "machismo" is absolutely ridiculous and I found myself even more disillusioned than ever before noticing that the guys who could barely hold more of a conversation about much more than the tetas passing by or their latest conquest to be the ones getting all of the attention.

I was really really interested in trying to figure out how all of this works because I prided myself as someone who could figure anything out, so I struggled with this for quite a while.

I hadn't yet listened to abraham or anything like that yet, but I was constantly bombarded with economic comparisons and disputes between members of the team, meanwhile no one seemed to be genuinely concerned with the functionality of the site, or figuring out what value we're actually offering to the user to benefit their lifestyle in some way.

although I was frustrated with understanding the girls thing, I noticed that it was very important for both males and females to be able to put up some sort of image (remember that this is back in 2006, before facebook began optimising their platform in that way), so I found it quite acceptable to give people more and more oppertunity to meet each other and to hook up as much as possible. the most common thing that I heard from people was them telling me how tuenti was the greatest thing for them to hook up with girls. I thought that was great and tried to optimise that experience as much as possible.

---

zaryn was another huge player for me, because he was trusted my technical ability (mostly), but when it came to decisions regarding the optimsation of the interaction, he valued the the (in my opinion retarded) advice of dudes that hooked up with a lot of girls more than mine -- even though, from my perspective none of these guys had a thoughtful braincell left in their heads from all of the alcohol they drank. I tried to learn how to drink as well as these guys could, but zaryn still didn't value my opinion.

I think zaryn really wanted me to be successful with women, so that he could accept me into his circle of douche and actually value me. I just couldn't do it because I had so much frustration toward women. I respected them highly, and he wanted to see me perceive them as objects like his "successful" friends did. like I mentioned before, I think this was misguided on his part, because what he was really looking for was self-valuation and confidence in me. I was somewhat self-destructive and I did not, at all, have any confidence when it came to trying to get a woman to do what I wanted her to do. I didn't want to try and figure out how to coerce them to do things.

I had studied the pickup artists for quite some time before then and I wasn't looking to do that. one thing one of them said really impacted me quite a bit, and it was that in order to be successful at picking up women, one must have a hobby that one really enjoys. I *really* liked programming, and I was very passionate about learning and optimising human communication -- so, in that sense I was already very attractive, but I couldn't get myself to do something I was not really comfortable doing, which was trying to find some way to get her to do something (this really is the spanish machismo sort of way).

---

tuenti, although it was very successful while I was working on it, geerated for me a tremendous amount of perception of things not yet wanted. I turned to alcoholism and drugs to try and figure it out. I was so preoccupied with trying to figure this out, I was always the guy that tried to rope the people around me into having a deep conversation about how things worked.

so, if you would like to perceive it that way, tuenti was a "failure" -- but for me it couldn't have been more of a success.

I've noticed a pattern in my life where I have tremendously great things happen to me, however I am constantly surrounded by people generating tons and tons of perception of things that I would consider unwanted.

I have sort of begun to come to terms with the idea that, if I want to remain connected to the fastest particle in the universe, then I will never get the ideal manifestation that I desire. I have come to underdtand this because no matter what it is, no matter how desired it may be, it'll always become something unwanted -- so, even though I might try for the ideal manifestation, I realise that it must be one that continually generates for me an even stronger perception of unwanted, to propel me forward with stronger and stronger desire.

I really am beginning to value those around me that generate this perception of unwanted -- for without them, I would stagnate and get comfortable, losing my focus. instead, now knowing what I know, the thing that "scares" me the most, is actually having too good of a manifestation, where things go too well.

I am additcted to "failure" -- as it's what propels me forward. I wouldn't change the tuenti experience to have been the ideal of actually being able to create the social network.

[1]: I've always been deeply scared of celebrations, because I feel like they are the wrong way to focus your thought. the highliner guy that rupert interviewed illuminated this for me well when he said that when he feels like doing tricks, it means he's gotten too comfortable, which means he's lost his focus. celebrations are a great way to loose focus. I don't think they're that productive, and only help one to lose focus. may 29, 2016 comes to mind as a perfect example of this -- which, I just looked up the "día de la asención" and even though it was marked on the calendar as the 28th, wikipedia says it was the 5th (!!). dunno how her calendar got the day wrong... perhaps they wanted to try and push a celebration... dunno.

[2]: I have always been very economically tolerant with people, even though I do not find money to be anything other than a form of slavery (even for the people with lots of it). I have always critisised jesus' turning the tables in the temple as his greatest mistake, because even though one *should* have a mind of abundance, pushing against the economic goals of the current institution in power is never a good idea. jesus even goes out of his way to tell people to "pay to cesar what is cesar's" -- so why he decides that paying to religion what is the religion, is beyond me, especially when LOA does not penalise people's offerings to a corrupt instutution, instead it gives results to the generosity of their heart.

[3]: additionally, I would like to mention in my meanderings around the internet was one of the themes that stood out to me, was this idea that the effects that nukes could cross timelines. it was claimed that aliens disabled many nukes, and a lot of the careless mistakes which would have resulted in a nuclear explosion, didn't happen because they were actively preventing their accidental (or intentional explosions) -- and that the ones that did go off, were planned for so as to not destroy things on other timelines. I dunno how true any of that is, but terence seems to be the first to mention it way back in 1986 when he told his fractal soliton of improbability theory.

[4]: matthew follows these events up with a parable about the two sons. matthew always groups relevant ideas together, and this parable has alwas stood out to me about the validity of your word. now, looking back at it, it almost seems as if it's a forshadow of the events I would be living today.

### **chapter four** :: what does it mean to be tuned into the "fastest paricle in the universe"

... tuning into who I *really* am :)
