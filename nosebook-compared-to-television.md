ono of the aspects that I really like about nosebook is that it is an alternative to television and movies. tv programs and movies (like games) present a false reality where the rules work a bit differently than they do in the normal attraction based reality where your thoughts and feelings have more to do with what's going on than can only be deduced visually. those visual mediums (movies, games, tv) usually do not give any real insight into the protagonist's thoughts -- and their emotions are never shown as response to their thoughts, but rather only as a response to what is happening.

this reinforces the idea that one is subjected to reality and can only react emotionally to what is presented. like the movie viewer, they are unable to affect or prevent the sequence of events which follow in the story.

nosebook changes this a bit. although I do not believe that anyone is broadcasting their thoughts on purpose (probably because no one will want to expose what is happening in their heads). however, I think that nosebook does provide access to certain people's thoughts to other certain people. the primary examples of interest I can think of would be: allowing law enforcement access the thoughts of people suspected of wrong-doing, and children's thoughts to their guardians. this serves as a great demonstration of watching thoughts turn into reality for those with access to other's thoughts. the real breakthrough comes when someone begins to pay attention to their own thoughts and sees the same sort of results happening in their own life too).

this and the other article are a bit opposites. this one argues that transmission of thought is a good thing (and will be invaluable to parents watching and trying to figure out where things went wrong while watching their children crash and burn in some situations, but not in others)
