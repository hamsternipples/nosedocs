# cult of the powerful motor

### synopsis

an idea I had just now to begin using humour as a ray of neutralising the effects, similar to the idea presented by lindsay in her video essay on the producers

[ add quote here ]

this idea may get expanded on as I convert the energy that was previouusly intended to make me feel bad, and turn it into something humorous.
