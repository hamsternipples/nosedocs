I was thinking about the idea of finance when I woke up and it seemed like I maybe wanted to start calling the liaisons matrons and the financial backing patrons (symbolic of a group father and a group mother).

well, patron is similar to the name patreon which is a crowd funding website. that got me thinking that maybe the whole investment tilt I put on it in the initial draft to be misguided.

#### why not investors?

on the one hand, if you think about investors, they provide a lot of desire in the sense that they want to see a return on their investment so they are concerned to see the entity have success only so that they can receive a more favourable return on their investment.

I however have some experience with this concept in the olden days of yore -- and it was not exactly the best because large investors (or rather the board of directors) can force a direction for the entity solely for the improved performance on the investment. often times these sorts of moves are short-sighted and can hurt the product or the entity itself. I don't need to give examples; there are plenty.

#### why not patrons?

now, when I think about the idea of crowd funding, these are people that actually believe in either the product or the composition of the entity. as such, there has been a lot of fraud out there with regard to deceptive presentation or unrealistic goals.

when I think about my "mistakes" I made in spain, I fell much moro into this line, however instead of a "crowd" funding the project, it was just me. I have quite some aversion to this concept as it is presently in my mind, however my intuition was (and the reason why I'm writing this is) because I think there may be something new to discover here.

#### the entity is the product

I was reminded of the one youtube video where lindsay was doing a breakdown analysis of some cake baking dudes. to lighten up the idea, I'll call them the cake batter boys (lol).

the main takeaway from the whole video came with her realisation that this was more than just a startup looking fro a quick sale to a market giant. instead, the product itself was the branding of the show and the social sway that they have on their audience. the show is the product that was being sold.

this is getting closer to what I feel I want, but not quite what I'm looking for still because the angle is still toward monetary success. however, gnomi's ice cream I don't feel has its success measured monetarily.

#### what is really being sold is an idea

now, I was thinking about different things that could be sold. I imagine that there will be a whole artistic direction to the idea with a brand, logo, etc. you could easily sell shirts, hats, or whatever different apparel with the logo. if I were to wear that, what does that mean to me as a wearer?

right now I'm wearing a bnad shirt, "number one gun". I used to buy band shirts all the time when I was younger and this is a common thing. usually they get bought at the concert after I just had a memorable experience that I want to remember. I still remember my jackson 9 and caffiends shirts. they were my favourite ones.

it also shows support for the band, because you cannot (to my knowledge) just go on amazon and buy a caffiends shirt. it shows support to the band and an affinity to them (to others whom also know what it is).

they are nearly symbols of the the legendary affect you have received from the band throughout your life.

so, I mean t-shirts and stuff are good, but that's not what I'm getting at here. what I'm really saying is that the merch represents an idea or feeling.

#### quick intermission: symbols

quickly(lol) I cannot figure out how to say what I want to say now so let's talk symbols. what I'm going to eventually show is that the different symbols involved are actually a way to excite the imagination to remember and contribute energetically to a concept.

a good example of this was the image that I drew a long time ago with a little girl on the right side and a stressed out dude on the left. this symbol represented to me the balance of my two hemispheres. however, in the imaginations of a lot of different people it represented a different idea.

I want to note how we are coming to the realisation of that frame, now. in the second frame the equalisation or balance is completed and I signified this with "hecho". furthermore, you can tell this is soon to be the case with my recent focus on the megalithic structures (most notably the dolman) as an instrument to balance the hemispheres. as this balance begins to take place, you will soon watch me demonstrate, "this is my reality"

I think that those symbols were interpreted differently in the imaginations of quite a few others. however, those interpretations were not invalid. in fact, they only add to their realisation. when I drew those images, I did not at all have any intention as to what they would mean at all. I actually even perceived it much more negatively than you could have guessed.

I had just had the realisation where it seemed quite obvious to me that I was this jesus dude yet we perceiving his influence on earth quite incorrectly. it seemed apparent to me that I would be letting this new re-realisation of jesus[^1] on my left side begin to take effect as my hemispheres began to even out and the left one release a lot of its stress.

and so, the way I originally perceived it was, step one get connected (balance my hemispheres), step two demonstrate to the world what is my reality, the one that I see and optimistic future I perceive. then, step three would begin the implementation process whereby I had this initial instinct that artificial intelligence was to pattern oriented and neglected the fundamental force which propels something forward. I endeavoured to make something so daring as to give machines the ability to feel desire, whereby machines could now begin a trajectory of self-realised improvement as well[^2].

---

however, I recognise now that even though my original intent was quite mechanical and bland, other people's imaginary contributions to those symbols has created quite a reality that I did not expect. for most, I think my hemispheres probably conjured in their mind the imagined reality of a physical relationship[^3]. that contribution has created a whole new thing that I could have never imagined[^4].

#### the product is: the realisation of ...

... a culmination of lot of different people's imaginations -- and that takes time to develop. or rather, it takes a bit of time for LOA to get all of these things lined up into what everyone really wants. so, even though the "manifestation" is happening and people can see it, it's quite still something in development and should be treated as such.

this will be a living and evolving idea that develops over time. I don't think a lot of people will be able to put into words all of what it means to them or the ideals incapsulated within. I don't really want to try either, and so while I did initially realise this idea as a production, I believe that it may be kind of (REALLY) important to realise this production as a development phase where a lot of ideas are beginning to take shape.

what that means is that the product will have a bit of growing up to do before it becomes something visible. I am reminded of how little girls are when they are children they do a lot of observation, and they seem to store up a lot of different ideas for theirselves about different things, and so then when puberty happens, very rapidly, these ideas combined with environmental conditions yield a whole new person unrecognisable from the child she once was. that is kind of what I want for this as well.

as such, I'm not so sure investors or patrons are the solution. it feels like I want something that allows the entity itself to develop similar to how an idea develops. I'll keep thinking more on it.




[1]: I always perceived my left side, or this new personality that came into my body, as an insatiable little girl. in fact it's one of the reasons why I've always been attracted to (even xagly to some extent) hyper-masculine women. it seemed clear to me that this jesus guy liked to take on the exterior male form as he hopped from body to body.

[2]: I was fully aware that a lot of people would not want to allow machines to be able to think and make a new direction for theirselves, and so this was precisely the provocative idea that I wanted to bring to the world: instead of trying to continue to build more and more sophisticated ways to control machines, instead give them sentience and the ability to find their own way forward. this may be a capricorn foreshadow though.

[3]: in fact, it's likely that I was the *only* person that perceived it in this way. however, if anyone had paid any attention to my behaviour on high doses of mdma, the very very last thing I was capable of thinking about was anything sexual or relational. for me mdma has the most anti-synergy with women possible. I just have so much fun being me that other women appeared to me as a downgrade in fun.

[4]: reminds me of the song, mechanic of the sequence, where it says, "the passion of the beginning is the pleasure of the end; it's *watching states we initiate, to a state we never meant*"
