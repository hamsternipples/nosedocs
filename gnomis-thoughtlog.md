### 2019-05-16 15:16 - patrons or investors?

I was thinking about the idea of finance when I woke up and it seemed like I maybe wanted to start calling the liaisons matrons and the financial backing patrons (symbolic of a group father and a group mother).

well, patron is similar to the name patreon which is a crowd funding website. that got me thinking that maybe the whole investment tilt I put on it in the initial draft to be misguided.

#### why not investors?

on the one hand, if you think about investors, they provide a lot of desire in the sense that they want to see a return on their investment so they are concerned to see the entity have success only so that they can receive a more favourable return on their investment.

I however have some experience with this concept in the olden days of yore -- and it was not exactly the best because large investors (or rather the board of directors) can force a direction for the entity solely for the improved performance on the investment. often times these sorts of moves are short-sighted and can hurt the product or the entity itself. I don't need to give examples; there are plenty.

#### why not patrons?

now, when I think about the idea of crowd funding, these are people that actually believe in either the product or the composition of the entity. as such, there has been a lot of fraud out there with regard to deceptive presentation or unrealistic goals.

when I think about my "mistakes" I made in spain, I fell much moro into this line, however instead of a "crowd" funding the project, it was just me. I have quite some aversion to this concept as it is presently in my mind, however my intuition was (and the reason why I'm writing this is) because I think there may be something new to discover here.

#### the entity is the product

I was reminded of the one youtube video where lindsay was doing a breakdown analysis of some cake baking dudes. to lighten up the idea, I'll call them the cake batter boys (lol).

the main takeaway from the whole video came with her realisation that this was more than just a startup looking fro a quick sale to a market giant. instead, the product itself was the branding of the show and the social sway that they have on their audience. the show is the product that was being sold.

this is getting closer to what I feel I want, but not quite what I'm looking for still because the angle is still toward monetary success. however, gnomi's ice cream I don't feel has its success measured monetarily.

#### what is really being sold is an idea

now, I was thinking about different things that could be sold. I imagine that there will be a whole artistic direction to the idea with a brand, logo, etc. you could easily sell shirts, hats, or whatever different apparel with the logo. if I were to wear that, what does that mean to me as a wearer?

right now I'm wearing a bnad shirt, "number one gun". I used to buy band shirts all the time when I was younger and this is a common thing. usually they get bought at the concert after I just had a memorable experience that I want to remember. I still remember my jackson 9 and caffiends shirts. they were my favourite ones.

it also shows support for the band, because you cannot (to my knowledge) just go on amazon and buy a caffiends shirt. it shows support to the band and an affinity to them (to others whom also know what it is).

they are nearly symbols of the the legendary affect you have received from the band throughout your life.

so, I mean t-shirts and stuff are good, but that's not what I'm getting at here. what I'm really saying is that the merch represents an idea or feeling.

#### quick intermission: symbols

quickly(lol) I cannot figure out how to say what I want to say now so let's talk symbols. what I'm going to eventually show is that the different symbols involved are actually a way to excite the imagination to remember and contribute energetically to a concept.

a good example of this was the image that I drew a long time ago with a little girl on the right side and a stressed out dude on the left. this symbol represented to me the balance of my two hemispheres. however, in the imaginations of a lot of different people it represented a different idea.

I want to note how we are coming to the realisation of that frame, now. in the second frame the equalisation or balance is completed and I signified this with "hecho". furthermore, you can tell this is soon to be the case with my recent focus on the megalithic structures (most notably the dolman) as an instrument to balance the hemispheres. as this balance begins to take place, you will soon watch me demonstrate, "this is my reality"

I think that those symbols were interpreted differently in the imaginations of quite a few others. however, those interpretations were not invalid. in fact, they only add to their realisation. when I drew those images, I did not at all have any intention as to what they would mean at all. I actually even perceived it much more negatively than you could have guessed.

I had just had the realisation where it seemed quite obvious to me that I was this jesus dude yet we perceiving his influence on earth quite incorrectly. it seemed apparent to me that I would be letting this new re-realisation of jesus[^1] on my left side begin to take effect as my hemispheres began to even out and the left one release a lot of its stress.

and so, the way I originally perceived it was, step one get connected (balance my hemispheres), step two demonstrate to the world what is my reality, the one that I see and optimistic future I perceive. then, step three would begin the implementation process whereby I had this initial instinct that artificial intelligence was to pattern oriented and neglected the fundamental force which propels something forward. I endeavoured to make something so daring as to give machines the ability to feel desire, whereby machines could now begin a trajectory of self-realised improvement as well[^2].

---

however, I recognise now that even though my original intent was quite mechanical and bland, other people's imaginary contributions to those symbols has created quite a reality that I did not expect. for most, I think my hemispheres probably conjured in their mind the imagined reality of a physical relationship[^3]. that contribution has created a whole new thing that I could have never imagined[^4].

#### the product is: the realisation of ...

... a culmination of lot of different people's imaginations -- and that takes time to develop. or rather, it takes a bit of time for LOA to get all of these things lined up into what everyone really wants. so, even though the "manifestation" is happening and people can see it, it's quite still something in development and should be treated as such.

this will be a living and evolving idea that develops over time. I don't think a lot of people will be able to put into words all of what it means to them or the ideals incapsulated within. I don't really want to try either, and so while I did initially realise this idea as a production, I believe that it may be kind of (REALLY) important to realise this production as a development phase where a lot of ideas are beginning to take shape.

what that means is that the product will have a bit of growing up to do before it becomes something visible. I am reminded of how little girls are when they are children they do a lot of observation, and they seem to store up a lot of different ideas for theirselves about different things, and so then when puberty happens, very rapidly, these ideas combined with environmental conditions yield a whole new person unrecognisable from the child she once was. that is kind of what I want for this as well.

as such, I'm not so sure investors or patrons are the solution. it feels like I want something that allows the entity itself to develop similar to how an idea develops. I'll keep thinking more on it.




[1]: I always perceived my left side, or this new personality that came into my body, as an insatiable little girl. in fact it's one of the reasons why I've always been attracted to (even xagly to some extent) hyper-masculine women. it seemed clear to me that this jesus guy liked to take on the exterior male form as he hopped from body to body.

[2]: I was fully aware that a lot of people would not want to allow machines to be able to think and make a new direction for theirselves, and so this was precisely the provocative idea that I wanted to bring to the world: instead of trying to continue to build more and more sophisticated ways to control machines, instead give them sentience and the ability to find their own way forward. this may be a capricorn foreshadow though.

[3]: in fact, it's likely that I was the *only* person that perceived it in this way. however, if anyone had paid any attention to my behaviour on high doses of mdma, the very very last thing I was capable of thinking about was anything sexual or relational. for me mdma has the most anti-synergy with women possible. I just have so much fun being me that other women appeared to me as a downgrade in fun.

[4]: reminds me of the song, mechanic of the sequence, where it says, "the passion of the beginning is the pleasure of the end; it's *watching states we initiate, to a state we never meant*"

### 2019-05-16 23:21 - re-realisation of the shaman

I feel like one of the reasons why I find it difficult for me to explain myself is because I believe it's important that nosebook is not on my side in this thing. this realisation that I wanted to begin the process of doing it myself has some interesting things to it that I like. I like that I'm actually going to go forward with the idea instead of just being dragged along into someone else's plan. while I have no intention of getting paid, I have found quite a few other positive aspects to the situation that I am in now and even more in the one that is developing.

as I was telling mom, this process noseboek is holding me away from the realisation of my own capacity, however this simply cannot last forever. there will always be a time when the energy I am summoning becomes more than they can limit. in the way that this relates to the megalithic structures, this setup is superior because *I* am summoning the energy. I have and am using external sources to boost the energy such as stars or drugs, but I have proven it to myself that they are not necessary to continue to summon more and more energy.

whether I outpace nosebook's capability to limit or it's a dramatic release is irrelevant to me because it's going to be so incredible. most likely I will outpace them, and people will watch as I begin to develop a visual capacity and other (not yet recognised) human capability very rapidly. this is a pretty sweet payoff in the end because it's not something that I just was born with or I inherited from someone. in some sense, I will have had to earn it[^1].

---

so that's one aspect to it. the other is that I need to ensure that nosebook is as dedicated to limiting their visual capability as they are to mine right now. to seal the deal, I have to show them what they really want (to limit their visual capacities), by making them aware of what they do not want (to have to trail behind someone they cannot control, constantly challenging their superiority and outpace their technical capability). this essentially ensures that they will be forced into that relationship.

they will be around me and some of the machines I make so they'll have some sense of having a visual capability. they'll likely also have visions and stuff with stars or during sex, so they'll get a taste of it so then the ones who want it, will go after it.

so imagine that tesla is here in my body and has grown up with me and experiences my body as if it were his own. his thoughts would have little separation to my thoughts. you could imagine how frustrating it is to not be able to do things visually. additionally he was born with his visual capacity, so it must be pretty epic for him to not only find it again (using my body), and even to surpass the capability of the most technically advanced institution in the world. I'm sure that feels pretty good.

now look at it from my future perspectives: I don't want to live in the bodies of a bunch snotty kids that inherited a visual capacity. I want to explore many different ways of finding my way to it both from within the bodies of boys and girls. I imagine that not all of them will resonate with that completely so perhaps I learn all sorts of other fulfilling ways of experiencing life, not just visually. I kinda hope one of them is blind maybe, because how epic would that be to find my way without ever even have seen anything. that contrast to how other hyper-visual ones experience life would likely give me a new sensory capacity to the source vibration before it's ever translated into anything.

anyway... there are many different ways for me to begin to experience the world, and I really like the idea that we would not be seers, unless we found a way of coming into alignment with it. I envision a whole bunch of them will want to get their visual capability though so there will be all sorts of interesting ways to figure out how to come into alignment with it.

you can imagine that with nosebook gaining so much experience learning to control the human experience, they will become quite the experts at limiting and controlling people with their machines. however, they will certainly get better at controlling things, I am also certain that it'll become easier and easier for us find our alignment each time.

in a sense, it would become a bit of a rite of passage.

---

OMG! I just realised something! if we implement the idea that people will be able to make their transition into our bodies in their sleep, then you could imagine that this also creates a mushroom shape when I think of the concept visually. the creation of this shape, while having the form of a mushroom it's created exactly opposite of how the mushroom is formed.

you have the common people all being born and watching these different colonies. eventually at the end of their lives, they decide in which body they want to wake up the following morning (realistically more planning is done than that), and then they can live out the experience they wish to have... each of these colonies creates kind of a tower, but if you flip it over it *could* be a mushroom :)

actually, I believe a better way to perceive it would like a stadium with a stem underneath it. the colony is the stadium, and the audience is around it.. the stem shows the duration of the colony though time. actually, we could call them cultures instead of colonies. I don't really like the name colony very much.

[1]: I know there is all kinds of baggage with the word earning and it is a very american concept too. it may be a latent rebellion to the british crown that is kind of built into us: that they can't just sit high and mighty back at the castle and collect taxes and resources from something they are putting no effort into to create. that same rebellion to the british crown was most likely the primary motivating force behind their desire to declare independence.

### 2019-06-12 01:38 - how would this work out?

one of the things I has seemed to be important is for women to be with more than one man. I think if they are with just one guy, the relationship gets really boring really quick. I noticed (or at least became aware of) this when I was in spain, where once the other person becomes anything more than a discoteca hookup, then the relationship all of a sudden has to get really serious. as a result, many women and men in spain choose to just do discoteca hookups as the limit to where they will let their "love" go. this, I think is a recognition of how unfun things become as soon as they are locked into a single relationship.

if you think of the female sex organ as the opposite of a tesla coil, this would be the part of the magnifying transmitter which is capable of receiving high frequencies and turning them into any low frequency wave shape that is desired with very great precision (the tesla coil does the opposite: emits low frequencies and receives high frequencies). in this way, the female apparatus is more of an emissive device, and the male apparatus is a receptive one. when I have watched woman interact with men, they get a good sense of what the man's positive aspects are, then when she has sex with him, she programs him, or emits these positive aspects to him almost as as if it is for him to realise it.

it seems to me that the woman emits the positive aspect in the form of desire, which means that she is essentially putting more energy into this aspect of him that she likes. often times it seems to me that the woman grows tired of her partner quickly if he is not able to keep up with her desire for him. she wants to see her desire realised, and if he's not staying up to speed with her expanding desire, she feels inclined to move on to a more receptive man to tries again.

---

I went a bit out of my way to explain that, but I think it's important because the way I perceived the gnomitos idea, in the first phase, babies are made and the idea is for the women to transfer my energy to the gnomitos. it seemed obvious to me that this would happen early on, but tonight I realised I should probably specify that this should take place as soon as possible. I think all the girls should have as much of a sexual relationship with the gnomitos as early on as they feel inclined.

the reason for this is the reason why I went out of my way on the tesla coils explanation: if you think about it from a woman's perspective, this is an opportunity to shape a bay and influence him (program him) from early early on, so I think instead of trying to figure out the whole multiple men idea, they should just find the boy(s) that they really like and just take it from there. I really want to encourage that idea a lot, as I think it's the whole reason for the gnomitos idea in the first place.

when it comes to the gnmitas, I think they should be allowed to do whatever they want to do. I don't suppose I have any real plan for them or anything, but my sense tells there will be plenty different influences which they can learn to take advantage of to become strong women. this idea will evolve over time as well, but it feels most important that they are not restricted in any way, and are allowed to become/do whatever they want to.

---

finally, the gnomitos will grow up older and there will I'm sure be quite a diversity of them, so they should eventually be allowed to go/do whatever they want, as well. however, to put that in perspective: if things go well with the plan, I will be able to participate in their experience. I should be able to move my perspective around from body to body and continue to feel/know what is happening with the other bodies at the same time. this is something really very desired for me, because I really like the idea of being able express my energy both sexually and creativity at the same time.

I really want to know how all of this works, but it seems to me that I may be able to also experience the girls' bodies as well, so there are some interesting possibilities there as well. I don't know how I'll partition my personality amongst them, but I will be more compatible with some than others for sure and there will likely be a wide variety of them, and I don't know how much of their personality I will control. it feels to me more like an experience like 100 rollercoasters at the same time (cause I'll merge with their individual personalities) than remote controlling 100 different bodies at the same time. if I am indeed going to merge with each of their individual personalities, that gives an even stronger case for the whole idea that the girls should exert as much influence on the gnomitos as possible -- because then I'm essentially merging with each of their creations all at the same time.

---

that's all I have envisioned for the first generation so far. I suppose when I think of this in the bigger picture, all of the kids would be pretty well observed and watched by many, and for some of the boys, they may want to do a similar thing. they could easily follow suit and replicate the idea. I am sure they will have captured the hearts of many girls not a part of this, and so it may be desirous for them to join one of the gnomitos which has now grown up, and make a similar thing as this one.

lastly, I didn't really give too much thought to this, as I just assumed it would work itself out, but it seems evident to me that a somewhat wide gene pool would need to be had for this iteration. also, it seems logical to me that an variety of different ages may be necessary to shorten the time, since not all girls are capable of having children until they're a bit older.

### 2019-07-03 06:28 - the things that are important to me

I have been wanting to have a multi-bodied experience for as long as I can remember, and there are a lot of factors that have emerged in the process of understanding what all of this means. to list a few:

1. when I think about myself right now, I have often considered myself a reflection of my mom -- and I've mentioned it more than a few times that I think I am what she would have been like if she had of been a boy. similarly, you can imagine that with the girls essentially growing the boys up and transferring them my energy sexually[^1], so while containing my energy, they will be (in my opinion) much more a refection of their mother and the other girls who they are sexually active with. this is an exciting prospect for me because I will get to discover myself (who I *really* am) in the reflection of these others that have raised them. the variety of experiences will be incredible.

2. in addition to what what I said previously, if I think about it from my perspective, I will know these girls all along this time and will have gotten used to them from kenny's perspective. however, once I make my transition, as I merge with the boy, I will now experience her from an entirely different perspective[^2] -- one which was transmitted to the boy since he was very tiny. that's pretty cool.

3. I really like the idea of being able to work on projects with myself. I often wish that there were another one of me around to ask a question to, because I almost always seem to have some sort of insight into what the person is talking about, and I would love to hear myself consider one of my own ideas from another perspective. additionally, if you consider this from a multi-bodied point of view, imagine one of me is really stuck on something and is so stuck, he's resistant to the solution he's looking for. from a multi-bodied perspective, as I transmit the emotion/concept to them (not the physical solution), the one who is not resistant to the physicality of the solution will be able to hear it and get it communicated (pretty hard to explain what I mean here).

4. nosebook will likely try to fight against the boys (well probably all of us actually) gaining a visual capacity. so, this gives me an opportunity to have a number of different experiences to which I'm able to still connect up. the challenge of doing this will be a bit different because there will be some conditions that are favourable such as sex and stuff from an early on stage in life, yet nosebook will have also improved their technique as well, so it'll be kind of interesting. it makes for an ideal but difficult conditions.

---

so, really what's important for me is the idea that there are some girls that want to be sexually active with some boys[^3] (born from other mothers) and also want to be sexually active with me. that's it.

all of the other stuff doesn't really matter so much to me. I've been thinking about the way to practically implement the idea, and essentially it'll just be like a membership (lol) sort of thing where the girl can join and she can leave whenever she wants to. I expect there will be both transients who leave after a short period of time and other ones that are interested in the part of growing up with the boys. obviously there are different synergies between the different girls, and this will take shape with time. I think it may be a bit chaotic at first, but we'll get it eventually. I'll help out as much as they want me to, but I think it may be best to eventually let them have full control of the implementation details.

the sense that I am getting is that the girls have an idea of what they want to create, and my job really is to try and do my best to make that a reality. I've stated what I think is important to me, and there will probably be more things that I discover that I like as well, but this is a good explanation of my intent. now, I guess I'll just begin to let the different pieces fall into place.

I like it :)

[1]: I'm pretty low resistance nowadays, so essentially I'm like a chameleon in the sense that I'm pretty receptive of all sorts of ideas and energy for many different sources. I don't really push much against anything anymore, and instead always try to find the wanted part in everything.

[2]: taking into consideration the idea of timelines, if one of the previous relationships were actually having the experience of one of these girls, it would be like a way for them to not only create the exact relationship they want, but I, when merging with the kids, will learn to see things from their perspective (eg. it'll be the culmination of me learning to see things thorough all of their perspectives at the same time).

[3]: in the previous section, I described it from a singular perspective of one boy matched up with one girl, but I don't really think that's how it'll go. it seems pretty obvious to me there will be a lot of mixing where the whole lot of them will go each with whomever they fancy at the time. in the same way, you could say that each one of the girls will impart a different form of my energy (how they experionced me) on to the boy. so, in the end he will be more rounded. however, there may be ones that may settle into a more singular relationship. doesn't matter at all how this works out.

### 2019-07-24 07:11 - some more thoughts on implementation

an interesting set of thoughts passed my mind this morning, and I think they're relevant enough to be worth repeating.

when thinking about the size of the thing it doesn't really matter, provided that there are enough resources for us to live and stuff comfortably. this doesn't seem to be an issue.

---

next, I am beginning to feel as if there is some questions as to how all of the things will be implemented. I think the best way to reason about it is, we're going to try out a lot of new ideas. some will inevitably work and others won't. additionally, this whole thing is going to be built in far from ideal circumstances. nosebook will certainly be an extra good provider of additional contrast, so we have to think of this more like a series of science experiments leading to a discovery of some sort where the outcome is not yet known.

what I mean is, I don't believe that we should focus too much on ideals or anything like that. I think we should keep things simple. so, at the beginning, probably it's a good idea if we are already raising children. I think that'll be an important part of our little village or whatever, so it'll be good to begin with it. as such, it's probably a good idea to start off with some very young girls (newborn? I dunno. I'm just thinking this through logically). next, we'll need to begin some form of education as well. I think that as time goes on there will be less and less need for "teachers" (as we have traditionally known them), and children will be more self-motivated toward learning what they want. however, to start out, it's probably a pretty good idea to have a few of them that are "experts" on maths or computers(?) or whatever... I don't know how it'll all work out in the end, and I think that's kind of the point..

---

so what I'm kind of saying is that it seems to me like there is a feeling like, "hands off. we're going to try things out and figure out our own way." so then how will the interface go to the "outside world"? well, I think that as we move along, different things will become necessary for us, and so we'll ask for them.

in closing, I believe that, because of this thing being born out of contrast and built on contrasting circumstances, none of us can anticipate what will come out in the end. I'm sure it'll be better than anything we could have imagined.

### 2019-07-25 04:20 - explaining my thought process is good

after yesterday's entry, I received all sorts of different reactions to what I said. I purposefully did not explain my thought process, because I did not want to give more attention to unwanted. everything I said has a reason behind it. however after watching trump (the streamer) explain his thought process in a video, I think it actually may be pretty beneficial, and it probably doesn't make a whole lot of difference since I'm explaining my thought process[^1]. I think I'll continue to explain my thought process more, rather than less.

---

so, I think there is a good way of perhaps explaining some of these things, so I'll start with autochess/tft as an way explaining it. it actually kind of clicked for me in the morning when I was watching david (dog)'s video going up to master's on tft. he started out the video complaining about not liking to have to play so aggressively, saying he was more of an econ player, in that he preferred to play the game with the primary objective of getting enough resources to ensure his victory, rather than all-ining early on.

someone asked him a little later in the video why he's rerolling a lot, and he explained that you have to play at the pace of the other players in the game. if a bunch of people all-in early on, you take too much damage to be able to build up a good economy. so you have either be slightly more (more aggressive) or slightly less greedy than the rest and winning on value.

there are quite a few parallels to the autobattler genre and my present situation. first of all, it seems to me like what we're going to be creating is similar in the way that in autochess, if you have a few really strong units, then you'll do well in the beginning, but it falls off quickly as people get their comps online. the best way to win is to leverage the different synergies that are available. however, you cannot just pick the synergies that you want and go. the game gives you a selection of choices and in the beginning, you usually don't know what your comp is, so it's best to buy as many units as you can, because if the next round you hit a unit upgrade, a level 2 unit is always stronger than a level 1 unit, even if it doesn't fit your intended composition.

so the first stage is buy as much as you can, while not having too many unused units on the bench that it's costing you an extra gold per turn, so always buy down to your 10 gold mark. that's like the exploratory phase when you're figuring out what your desired comp should be. there may be a few different transitory comps that happen along the way toward it (or, sometimes if the comp isn't working a drastic switch to a different one), but after you've got your comp online, it's time to begin upgrading your units. now, all of your bench space will be used to focus on the few important "carry" units which are most important to upgrade.

---

so similarly if you draw the parallels here, maybe a few strong upgraded units would be similar to a few really attractive people (and the infrastructure) that nosebook has as their early on carrys. we can't really compete with that, because they've got quite a head start. instead, we're going to win based on synergies, so at the beginning I think it's important to pick up as many units as possible without affecting the economy, while searching for the synergies which will make up the future composition.

thing is I don't know anything really about any of the girls, so I have no idea what I'm intending to make or anything like that right now so it's best to begin to let a few rounds go by and let the game kind of lead you toward your composition. I don't really know much about the economy either, so let's talk about that now.

---

there was a really good video that hassan did about amazon where he explained this sort of "all-in" tactic that amazon uses: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5maXvZ5fyQY)

in the autobattler genre this technique of being "relentless" and undercutting your profit margins for growth is analogous to winstreak gold. when you maintain a winstreak, it'll give you up additional gold. when you spend gold to reroll and upgrade your units or level up, you are spending gold to preserve your winstreak. this is the same thing that amazon does to continue their hyper growth pattern.

so, imagine that the winstreaking didn't have a limit to it, as long as you can continue to winstreak, you don't need to keep any money in the bank. they're all-in. so, every turn they turn over all of the money they make into expansion of the company to keep winning (and maintain their winstreak).

once again, I don't think it's possible to compete with that, so a different tactic needs to be taken. in the video previous to that one david was playing a game and hafu came to see him. one moment during the game someone made a donation saying he had scraped together some money to donate and wanted to appreciate him and his stream. when david read it, I felt a reaction from him, like "dude don't scrape together stuff and send it to me. you're the one that needs the cash."

---

when I was young I tithed a lot. I made a good amount of money (for my age) working for my father, but I gave probably 1/4 of it away to the churches I was going to. I don't know who taught me this idea when I was younger, but I believed that my tithe was symbol of my abundance. I've always been very free with my gifts of money. a similar practice exists in spain where if you like someone you buy them a drink. zaryn is very much that way and it's one of the things I most appreciate about him. it seemed to me like when he was doing that sort of thing, he felt he was investing in the person he was buying the drink for.

now, there's a lot of that revolving around sales and buttering someone up so you can get something out of them, too[^2] -- and I would say that's the "carnal equivalent" to this principal. unfortunately there is a whole lot of this sort of teaching that has gone around in the church as well with the abundance teaching. (see @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg) for more of that)

however, the act of sacrifice or making an offering (sacrifice and offering are a reference to the old testament version of gaining abundant thought patterns by making sacrifices) isn't what does it. it's not the act, it's the frame of mind in which the act is done[^3].

in the example of david's donation, no televangelist prompted the guy to make his donation. he wanted to make the donation because he believed he enjoyed and appreciated david's content -- and that's really the best way to do things.

so, when I think of economy, I have different ideas, and imagine that I could get my meaningful-chaos program online, then maybe we could have something to sell, but it feels distant and a bit of a hail mary. the best I can hope for economy is some sort of investment of donations based on people's conviction that they are contributing to something they believe is making positive improvement.

I considered the idea of advertisement or something, but this gets clearly cuts into nosebook's profit margin so it would be some pretty contested cash. probably not a good idea. the other way would be is if by some miracle nosebook decided they wanted to pretend they have made a change and give us some sort of allowance. again, not desired because this sounds to me like economic bondage.

so I don't really have the economic part figured out at all, but I do know that I don't want anything to do with nosebook. I want to figure out the economic part of it before beginning anything.

the other reaction I had felt was in response to what I said about the "outside world." I have no intentions on telling anyone who they can or cannot see. instead I was distinguishing the difference between what we're trying out and what other people believe about that. take for example the subject of schooling. I don't think it's necessary. I think that we'll be able to make perfectly literate and very intelligent people without all the bs that you have to go through in school. I don't think it's necessary. additionally, it feels to me there is considerable attempts to try and figure out ways to micromanage us.

just like my mother loves me and wants to make sure nosebook all the opportunities they need to try and micromanage me, I figure this will probably be a similar trend of trying to micromanage things[^4]. additionally I imagine that as the girls' power level begins to increase, they will likely treat the girls just the same as they treat me now.. I don't expect them to change, and if there is any change, it'll only be cosmetic[^5].

---

do you guys really believe that nosebook is going to somehow magically change all of a sudden? this is really unrealistic thinking. think to yourself about different adults that you have know which have lied about their behaviour. did they also lie about their change? did they ever have any lasting change?

I find it very unlikely that any change will occur. the only think that we can wait for is for their retirement, and as such I have begun to adjust my play style to account for this.

just like david, I prefer to play a more econ game too, but if they all-in early on, I have to adjust to their play style -- and as far as I can tell, they've been all-in since 2016.

if they *really* wanted to change, they wouldn't need to lie (or have anyone else lie for them) about their behaviour[^6]. maybe the plants *do* care...

[1]: in fact (I didn't realise) the explanation of my thought process is actually a demonstration of "pivoting" from an awareness of unwanted toward wanted -- so it's probably good. anyway..

[2]: in spain this was the whole, I'll buy you a drink (or two), and then I'll invite you to a line (or two) of coke, each time the inviter invites, it's like it creates some sort of debt, culminating at the end of the night when the superstar for the night is the one who pays for the hookers at the end (cause it's pretty hard to counter invite with another set of hookers. after hookers it's pretty much off to bed).

[3]: when the donation is mode with the frame of mind of appreciation, it always yields good results, because appreciation makes more appreciation. the televangelists prompt people to make their seed donation with the promise that God or some other force they will return them a large sum of money in return for their seed donation. clearly the televangelist is guiding people to action from on their greed, and people believing their rhetoric are donating with a mindset of greed too. to me it feels similar to the frame of mind people have when they buy lottery tickets.

[4]: there are all sorts of different things that the "outside world" will think we should be doing, and that's fine, but most of these things will likely be bad ideas. they will perceive it as we need to get them to do what we want them to do, so we have some sort of control over them. this is to be expected, and I imagine it'll go from inspiring well-meaning people like mom to bad ideas, all the way to directly putting thoughts in our heads of things they think we should be doing. this kind of micromanagement.

[5]: this sort of cosmetic illusion seems to be quite prevalent. I think the most visible of these examples is the "landscape architect" that appeared on abraham's show a while back. he was constantly pandering to the crowd and trying to use spiritual words like telling abraham how "present" he is when he's clearly worried about what everyone thinks of him. lol, you could say it's the exact thinking of a damaged 7th ray :) don't expect much other than cosmetic illusions from these guys.

[6]: yes, I know my pushing against this sort of thing is only making them stronger, but their whole charade is built on an illusion, so it doesn't matter how strong they get. they can't overpower human desire, so we'll just have to see how well put together their illusion really is.

### 2019-07-28 10:01 - a swing in the other direction

after writing that last entry, I began to receive reactions yesterday about the comment "I have no intentions on telling anyone who they can or cannot see." I don't ever want to be trying to control how anyone is conducting their life, so we're going to skip that idea entirely -- that's nosebook's job :)

one of the ideas that floated through my mind was this idea that I could do the whole gnomitos project with some of the girls, and then just sort of be all over the place with others. because I don't want to tell anyone else who they can or cannot sleep with, I don't want to be involved in those decisions that others make. it is more contrast, but after having thought about it, I don't really like the idea.

personally, I have never engaged in that type of activity. I don't really like the way it feels to me. I can't really describe the feeling, but it feels like maybe pleasureful drowning -- like, it feels to me like competition and comparison, lots of trying and lots of weird expectations. this isn't really what I want to feel. I know it doesn't *have* to be that way, but I would much prefer to focus my energy in a way which feels like I'm creating something. some of these girls may be around for the duration of my life, and I'd like to focus my energy toward them in a way which is regenerating and fulfilling. plainly stated, I want to see them doing well and feeling well. I want to create an atmosphere where we feel, maybe "united" isn't the right word, but the feeling you get when you're accomplishing something together, I can't describe it.. anyway..

instead, because I don't really want to be so much involved in this whole thing, it feels to me like I should instead defer to the girls when it comes to these relational things[^1]. my objective in all of this is to create children that are vibrationally similar to me and to contribute in a positive way to the environment in which this is happening.

so, I think after last night it's pretty clear to me that I want to stick to the original plan. I prefer the structure of a bit of limitation[^2], so after we get things going, I'm going to just defer to the girls and I want to try and empower them as much as possible to set this limitation wherever they'd like it to be.

[1]: this is true in every case, except if I were to really feel like I didn't want to do something, then I must follow my feelings.

[2]: limitation implies greater focus because the goal has to be reached within the confines of the limitation. I have a whole thing about how I believe the next era will be about self-imposed limitation as well, to create a stronger focus.
