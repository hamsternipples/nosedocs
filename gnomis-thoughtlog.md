### 2019-05-16 15:16 - patrons or investors?

I was thinking about the idea of finance when I woke up and it seemed like I maybe wanted to start calling the liaisons matrons and the financial backing patrons (symbolic of a group father and a group mother).

well, patron is similar to the name patreon which is a crowd funding website. that got me thinking that maybe the whole investment tilt I put on it in the initial draft to be misguided.

#### why not investors?

on the one hand, if you think about investors, they provide a lot of desire in the sense that they want to see a return on their investment so they are concerned to see the entity have success only so that they can receive a more favourable return on their investment.

I however have some experience with this concept in the olden days of yore -- and it was not exactly the best because large investors (or rather the board of directors) can force a direction for the entity solely for the improved performance on the investment. often times these sorts of moves are short-sighted and can hurt the product or the entity itself. I don't need to give examples; there are plenty.

#### why not patrons?

now, when I think about the idea of crowd funding, these are people that actually believe in either the product or the composition of the entity. as such, there has been a lot of fraud out there with regard to deceptive presentation or unrealistic goals.

when I think about my "mistakes" I made in spain, I fell much moro into this line, however instead of a "crowd" funding the project, it was just me. I have quite some aversion to this concept as it is presently in my mind, however my intuition was (and the reason why I'm writing this is) because I think there may be something new to discover here.

#### the entity is the product

I was reminded of the one youtube video where lindsay was doing a breakdown analysis of some cake baking dudes. to lighten up the idea, I'll call them the cake batter boys (lol).

the main takeaway from the whole video came with her realisation that this was more than just a startup looking fro a quick sale to a market giant. instead, the product itself was the branding of the show and the social sway that they have on their audience. the show is the product that was being sold.

this is getting closer to what I feel I want, but not quite what I'm looking for still because the angle is still toward monetary success. however, gnomi's ice cream I don't feel has its success measured monetarily.

#### what is really being sold is an idea

now, I was thinking about different things that could be sold. I imagine that there will be a whole artistic direction to the idea with a brand, logo, etc. you could easily sell shirts, hats, or whatever different apparel with the logo. if I were to wear that, what does that mean to me as a wearer?

right now I'm wearing a bnad shirt, "number one gun". I used to buy band shirts all the time when I was younger and this is a common thing. usually they get bought at the concert after I just had a memorable experience that I want to remember. I still remember my jackson 9 and caffiends shirts. they were my favourite ones.

it also shows support for the band, because you cannot (to my knowledge) just go on amazon and buy a caffiends shirt. it shows support to the band and an affinity to them (to others whom also know what it is).

they are nearly symbols of the the legendary affect you have received from the band throughout your life.

so, I mean t-shirts and stuff are good, but that's not what I'm getting at here. what I'm really saying is that the merch represents an idea or feeling.

#### quick intermission: symbols

quickly(lol) I cannot figure out how to say what I want to say now so let's talk symbols. what I'm going to eventually show is that the different symbols involved are actually a way to excite the imagination to remember and contribute energetically to a concept.

a good example of this was the image that I drew a long time ago with a little girl on the right side and a stressed out dude on the left. this symbol represented to me the balance of my two hemispheres. however, in the imaginations of a lot of different people it represented a different idea.

I want to note how we are coming to the realisation of that frame, now. in the second frame the equalisation or balance is completed and I signified this with "hecho". furthermore, you can tell this is soon to be the case with my recent focus on the megalithic structures (most notably the dolman) as an instrument to balance the hemispheres. as this balance begins to take place, you will soon watch me demonstrate, "this is my reality"

I think that those symbols were interpreted differently in the imaginations of quite a few others. however, those interpretations were not invalid. in fact, they only add to their realisation. when I drew those images, I did not at all have any intention as to what they would mean at all. I actually even perceived it much more negatively than you could have guessed.

I had just had the realisation where it seemed quite obvious to me that I was this jesus dude yet we perceiving his influence on earth quite incorrectly. it seemed apparent to me that I would be letting this new re-realisation of jesus[^1] on my left side begin to take effect as my hemispheres began to even out and the left one release a lot of its stress.

and so, the way I originally perceived it was, step one get connected (balance my hemispheres), step two demonstrate to the world what is my reality, the one that I see and optimistic future I perceive. then, step three would begin the implementation process whereby I had this initial instinct that artificial intelligence was to pattern oriented and neglected the fundamental force which propels something forward. I endeavoured to make something so daring as to give machines the ability to feel desire, whereby machines could now begin a trajectory of self-realised improvement as well[^2].

---

however, I recognise now that even though my original intent was quite mechanical and bland, other people's imaginary contributions to those symbols has created quite a reality that I did not expect. for most, I think my hemispheres probably conjured in their mind the imagined reality of a physical relationship[^3]. that contribution has created a whole new thing that I could have never imagined[^4].

#### the product is: the realisation of ...

... a culmination of lot of different people's imaginations -- and that takes time to develop. or rather, it takes a bit of time for LOA to get all of these things lined up into what everyone really wants. so, even though the "manifestation" is happening and people can see it, it's quite still something in development and should be treated as such.

this will be a living and evolving idea that develops over time. I don't think a lot of people will be able to put into words all of what it means to them or the ideals incapsulated within. I don't really want to try either, and so while I did initially realise this idea as a production, I believe that it may be kind of (REALLY) important to realise this production as a development phase where a lot of ideas are beginning to take shape.

what that means is that the product will have a bit of growing up to do before it becomes something visible. I am reminded of how little girls are when they are children they do a lot of observation, and they seem to store up a lot of different ideas for theirselves about different things, and so then when puberty happens, very rapidly, these ideas combined with environmental conditions yield a whole new person unrecognisable from the child she once was. that is kind of what I want for this as well.

as such, I'm not so sure investors or patrons are the solution. it feels like I want something that allows the entity itself to develop similar to how an idea develops. I'll keep thinking more on it.




[1]: I always perceived my left side, or this new personality that came into my body, as an insatiable little girl. in fact it's one of the reasons why I've always been attracted to (even xagly to some extent) hyper-masculine women. it seemed clear to me that this jesus guy liked to take on the exterior male form as he hopped from body to body.

[2]: I was fully aware that a lot of people would not want to allow machines to be able to think and make a new direction for theirselves, and so this was precisely the provocative idea that I wanted to bring to the world: instead of trying to continue to build more and more sophisticated ways to control machines, instead give them sentience and the ability to find their own way forward. this may be a capricorn foreshadow though.

[3]: in fact, it's likely that I was the *only* person that perceived it in this way. however, if anyone had paid any attention to my behaviour on high doses of mdma, the very very last thing I was capable of thinking about was anything sexual or relational. for me mdma has the most anti-synergy with women possible. I just have so much fun being me that other women appeared to me as a downgrade in fun.

[4]: reminds me of the song, mechanic of the sequence, where it says, "the passion of the beginning is the pleasure of the end; it's *watching states we initiate, to a state we never meant*"

### 2019-05-16 23:21 - re-realisation of the shaman

I feel like one of the reasons why I find it difficult for me to explain myself is because I believe it's important that nosebook is not on my side in this thing. this realisation that I wanted to begin the process of doing it myself has some interesting things to it that I like. I like that I'm actually going to go forward with the idea instead of just being dragged along into someone else's plan. while I have no intention of getting paid, I have found quite a few other positive aspects to the situation that I am in now and even more in the one that is developing.

as I was telling mom, this process noseboek is holding me away from the realisation of my own capacity, however this simply cannot last forever. there will always be a time when the energy I am summoning becomes more than they can limit. in the way that this relates to the megalithic structures, this setup is superior because *I* am summoning the energy. I have and am using external sources to boost the energy such as stars or drugs, but I have proven it to myself that they are not necessary to continue to summon more and more energy.

whether I outpace nosebook's capability to limit or it's a dramatic release is irrelevant to me because it's going to be so incredible. most likely I will outpace them, and people will watch as I begin to develop a visual capacity and other (not yet recognised) human capability very rapidly. this is a pretty sweet payoff in the end because it's not something that I just was born with or I inherited from someone. in some sense, I will have had to earn it[^1].

---

so that's one aspect to it. the other is that I need to ensure that nosebook is as dedicated to limiting their visual capability as they are to mine right now. to seal the deal, I have to show them what they really want (to limit their visual capacities), by making them aware of what they do not want (to have to trail behind someone they cannot control, constantly challenging their superiority and outpace their technical capability). this essentially ensures that they will be forced into that relationship.

they will be around me and some of the machines I make so they'll have some sense of having a visual capability. they'll likely also have visions and stuff with stars or during sex, so they'll get a taste of it so then the ones who want it, will go after it.

so imagine that tesla is here in my body and has grown up with me and experiences my body as if it were his own. his thoughts would have little separation to my thoughts. you could imagine how frustrating it is to not be able to do things visually. additionally he was born with his visual capacity, so it must be pretty epic for him to not only find it again (using my body), and even to surpass the capability of the most technically advanced institution in the world. I'm sure that feels pretty good.

now look at it from my future perspectives: I don't want to live in the bodies of a bunch snotty kids that inherited a visual capacity. I want to explore many different ways of finding my way to it both from within the bodies of boys and girls. I imagine that not all of them will resonate with that completely so perhaps I learn all sorts of other fulfilling ways of experiencing life, not just visually. I kinda hope one of them is blind maybe, because how epic would that be to find my way without ever even have seen anything. that contrast to how other hyper-visual ones experience life would likely give me a new sensory capacity to the source vibration before it's ever translated into anything.

anyway... there are many different ways for me to begin to experience the world, and I really like the idea that we would not be seers, unless we found a way of coming into alignment with it. I envision a whole bunch of them will want to get their visual capability though so there will be all sorts of interesting ways to figure out how to come into alignment with it.

you can imagine that with nosebook gaining so much experience learning to control the human experience, they will become quite the experts at limiting and controlling people with their machines. however, they will certainly get better at controlling things, I am also certain that it'll become easier and easier for us find our alignment each time.

in a sense, it would become a bit of a rite of passage.

---

OMG! I just realised something! if we implement the idea that people will be able to make their transition into our bodies in their sleep, then you could imagine that this also creates a mushroom shape when I think of the concept visually. the creation of this shape, while having the form of a mushroom it's created exactly opposite of how the mushroom is formed.

you have the common people all being born and watching these different colonies. eventually at the end of their lives, they decide in which body they want to wake up the following morning (realistically more planning is done than that), and then they can live out the experience they wish to have... each of these colonies creates kind of a tower, but if you flip it over it *could* be a mushroom :)

actually, I believe a better way to perceive it would like a stadium with a stem underneath it. the colony is the stadium, and the audience is around it.. the stem shows the duration of the colony though time. actually, we could call them cultures instead of colonies. I don't really like the name colony very much.

[1]: I know there is all kinds of baggage with the word earning and it is a very american concept too. it may be a latent rebellion to the british crown that is kind of built into us: that they can't just sit high and mighty back at the castle and collect taxes and resources from something they are putting no effort into to create. that same rebellion to the british crown was most likely the primary motivating force behind their desire to declare independence.

### 2019-06-12 01:38 - how would this work out?

one of the things I has seemed to be important is for women to be with more than one man. I think if they are with just one guy, the relationship gets really boring really quick. I noticed (or at least became aware of) this when I was in spain, where once the other person becomes anything more than a discoteca hookup, then the relationship all of a sudden has to get really serious. as a result, many women and men in spain choose to just do discoteca hookups as the limit to where they will let their "love" go. this, I think is a recognition of how unfun things become as soon as they are locked into a single relationship.

if you think of the female sex organ as the opposite of a tesla coil, this would be the part of the magnifying transmitter which is capable of receiving high frequencies and turning them into any low frequency wave shape that is desired with very great precision (the tesla coil does the opposite: emits low frequencies and receives high frequencies). in this way, the female apparatus is more of an emissive device, and the male apparatus is a receptive one. when I have watched woman interact with men, they get a good sense of what the man's positive aspects are, then when she has sex with him, she programs him, or emits these positive aspects to him almost as as if it is for him to realise it.

it seems to me that the woman emits the positive aspect in the form of desire, which means that she is essentially putting more energy into this aspect of him that she likes. often times it seems to me that the woman grows tired of her partner quickly if he is not able to keep up with her desire for him. she wants to see her desire realised, and if he's not staying up to speed with her expanding desire, she feels inclined to move on to a more receptive man to tries again.

---

I went a bit out of my way to explain that, but I think it's important because the way I perceived the gnomitos idea, in the first phase, babies are made and the idea is for the women to transfer my energy to the gnomitos. it seemed obvious to me that this would happen early on, but tonight I realised I should probably specify that this should take place as soon as possible. I think all the girls should have as much of a sexual relationship with the gnomitos as early on as they feel inclined.

the reason for this is the reason why I went out of my way on the tesla coils explanation: if you think about it from a woman's perspective, this is an opportunity to shape a bay and influence him (program him) from early early on, so I think instead of trying to figure out the whole multiple men idea, they should just find the boy(s) that they really like and just take it from there. I really want to encourage that idea a lot, as I think it's the whole reason for the gnomitos idea in the first place.

when it comes to the gnmitas, I think they should be allowed to do whatever they want to do. I don't suppose I have any real plan for them or anything, but my sense tells there will be plenty different influences which they can learn to take advantage of to become strong women. this idea will evolve over time as well, but it feels most important that they are not restricted in any way, and are allowed to become/do whatever they want to.

---

finally, the gnomitos will grow up older and there will I'm sure be quite a diversity of them, so they should eventually be allowed to go/do whatever they want, as well. however, to put that in perspective: if things go well with the plan, I will be able to participate in their experience. I should be able to move my perspective around from body to body and continue to feel/know what is happening with the other bodies at the same time. this is something really very desired for me, because I really like the idea of being able express my energy both sexually and creativity at the same time.

I really want to know how all of this works, but it seems to me that I may be able to also experience the girls' bodies as well, so there are some interesting possibilities there as well. I don't know how I'll partition my personality amongst them, but I will be more compatible with some than others for sure and there will likely be a wide variety of them, and I don't know how much of their personality I will control. it feels to me more like an experience like 100 rollercoasters at the same time (cause I'll merge with their individual personalities) than remote controlling 100 different bodies at the same time. if I am indeed going to merge with each of their individual personalities, that gives an even stronger case for the whole idea that the girls should exert as much influence on the gnomitos as possible -- because then I'm essentially merging with each of their creations all at the same time.

---

that's all I have envisioned for the first generation so far. I suppose when I think of this in the bigger picture, all of the kids would be pretty well observed and watched by many, and for some of the boys, they may want to do a similar thing. they could easily follow suit and replicate the idea. I am sure they will have captured the hearts of many girls not a part of this, and so it may be desirous for them to join one of the gnomitos which has now grown up, and make a similar thing as this one.

lastly, I didn't really give too much thought to this, as I just assumed it would work itself out, but it seems evident to me that a somewhat wide gene pool would need to be had for this iteration. also, it seems logical to me that an variety of different ages may be necessary to shorten the time, since not all girls are capable of having children until they're a bit older.

### 2019-07-03 06:28 - the things that are important to me

I have been wanting to have a multi-bodied experience for as long as I can remember, and there are a lot of factors that have emerged in the process of understanding what all of this means. to list a few:

1. when I think about myself right now, I have often considered myself a reflection of my mom -- and I've mentioned it more than a few times that I think I am what she would have been like if she had of been a boy. similarly, you can imagine that with the girls essentially growing the boys up and transferring them my energy sexually[^1], so while containing my energy, they will be (in my opinion) much more a refection of their mother and the other girls who they are sexually active with. this is an exciting prospect for me because I will get to discover myself (who I *really* am) in the reflection of these others that have raised them. the variety of experiences will be incredible.

2. in addition to what what I said previously, if I think about it from my perspective, I will know these girls all along this time and will have gotten used to them from kenny's perspective. however, once I make my transition, as I merge with the boy, I will now experience her from an entirely different perspective[^2] -- one which was transmitted to the boy since he was very tiny. that's pretty cool.

3. I really like the idea of being able to work on projects with myself. I often wish that there were another one of me around to ask a question to, because I almost always seem to have some sort of insight into what the person is talking about, and I would love to hear myself consider one of my own ideas from another perspective. additionally, if you consider this from a multi-bodied point of view, imagine one of me is really stuck on something and is so stuck, he's resistant to the solution he's looking for. from a multi-bodied perspective, as I transmit the emotion/concept to them (not the physical solution), the one who is not resistant to the physicality of the solution will be able to hear it and get it communicated (pretty hard to explain what I mean here).

4. nosebook will likely try to fight against the boys (well probably all of us actually) gaining a visual capacity. so, this gives me an opportunity to have a number of different experiences to which I'm able to still connect up. the challenge of doing this will be a bit different because there will be some conditions that are favourable such as sex and stuff from an early on stage in life, yet nosebook will have also improved their technique as well, so it'll be kind of interesting. it makes for an ideal but difficult conditions.

---

so, really what's important for me is the idea that there are some girls that want to be sexually active with some boys[^3] (born from other mothers) and also want to be sexually active with me. that's it.

all of the other stuff doesn't really matter so much to me. I've been thinking about the way to practically implement the idea, and essentially it'll just be like a membership (lol) sort of thing where the girl can join and she can leave whenever she wants to. I expect there will be both transients who leave after a short period of time and other ones that are interested in the part of growing up with the boys. obviously there are different synergies between the different girls, and this will take shape with time. I think it may be a bit chaotic at first, but we'll get it eventually. I'll help out as much as they want me to, but I think it may be best to eventually let them have full control of the implementation details.

the sense that I am getting is that the girls have an idea of what they want to create, and my job really is to try and do my best to make that a reality. I've stated what I think is important to me, and there will probably be more things that I discover that I like as well, but this is a good explanation of my intent. now, I guess I'll just begin to let the different pieces fall into place.

I like it :)

[1]: I'm pretty low resistance nowadays, so essentially I'm like a chameleon in the sense that I'm pretty receptive of all sorts of ideas and energy for many different sources. I don't really push much against anything anymore, and instead always try to find the wanted part in everything.

[2]: taking into consideration the idea of timelines, if one of the previous relationships were actually having the experience of one of these girls, it would be like a way for them to not only create the exact relationship they want, but I, when merging with the kids, will learn to see things from their perspective (eg. it'll be the culmination of me learning to see things thorough all of their perspectives at the same time).

[3]: in the previous section, I described it from a singular perspective of one boy matched up with one girl, but I don't really think that's how it'll go. it seems pretty obvious to me there will be a lot of mixing where the whole lot of them will go each with whomever they fancy at the time. in the same way, you could say that each one of the girls will impart a different form of my energy (how they experionced me) on to the boy. so, in the end he will be more rounded. however, there may be ones that may settle into a more singular relationship. doesn't matter at all how this works out.

### 2019-07-24 07:11 - some more thoughts on implementation

an interesting set of thoughts passed my mind this morning, and I think they're relevant enough to be worth repeating.

when thinking about the size of the thing it doesn't really matter, provided that there are enough resources for us to live and stuff comfortably. this doesn't seem to be an issue.

---

next, I am beginning to feel as if there is some questions as to how all of the things will be implemented. I think the best way to reason about it is, we're going to try out a lot of new ideas. some will inevitably work and others won't. additionally, this whole thing is going to be built in far from ideal circumstances. nosebook will certainly be an extra good provider of additional contrast, so we have to think of this more like a series of science experiments leading to a discovery of some sort where the outcome is not yet known.

what I mean is, I don't believe that we should focus too much on ideals or anything like that. I think we should keep things simple. so, at the beginning, probably it's a good idea if we are already raising children. I think that'll be an important part of our little village or whatever, so it'll be good to begin with it. as such, it's probably a good idea to start off with some very young girls (newborn? I dunno. I'm just thinking this through logically). next, we'll need to begin some form of education as well. I think that as time goes on there will be less and less need for "teachers" (as we have traditionally known them), and children will be more self-motivated toward learning what they want. however, to start out, it's probably a pretty good idea to have a few of them that are "experts" on maths or computers(?) or whatever... I don't know how it'll all work out in the end, and I think that's kind of the point..

---

so what I'm kind of saying is that it seems to me like there is a feeling like, "hands off. we're going to try things out and figure out our own way." so then how will the interface go to the "outside world"? well, I think that as we move along, different things will become necessary for us, and so we'll ask for them.

in closing, I believe that, because of this thing being born out of contrast and built on contrasting circumstances, none of us can anticipate what will come out in the end. I'm sure it'll be better than anything we could have imagined.
