las palabras de mi buen amigo pierre que me inspir√≥ escribir este documento: "tienes todas las cartas en tu mano; pide lo que quieras"

and so: (first of all, thanks pierre!) here are some of my goals for moving forward:

I know what you're thinking, "kenny, this isn't a negotiation." I agree. I am structuring this in such a way that I am only outlining my goals for me, and nothing more. I am doing this to ensure clarity by having this discussion out in the open. obviously for any part requiring collaboration to be made, it is prudent to wait for such an agreement on the terms of that collaboration. therefore, it is also my goal that any such agreement will also be made publicly. I would like to consider myself to become the first open-source human and this is the plan (as I see it) forward to realise that goal.
