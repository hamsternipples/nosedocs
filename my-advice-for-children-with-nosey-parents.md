observe your breath for a moment with me. notice how as soon as you began to observe your breath, you began to control your breath. it is not very common that you see someone observing something else and not at least having an opinion about it. you can guarantee that your parents will likely have at least an opinion about your thoughts/behaviour -- and you can probably imagine that they will have a desire to improve some of the things you're coming up short on.

#### control > opinion > observe

so, what is the difference between your breath and some thing like an ant farm, where you feel no desire to get in there and help the ants move things around? I don't know for certain, but I think we try to control

these are some of the ways I would recommend children respond to their parents focus on their life

## 1. don't lie

not so that you don't get into trouble, but so you are not dishonest with yourself. there is great power in living by your own truth. everyone has a different idea about what exactly "truth" is, and that is alright, but when I say something in contradiction to what I already believe to be true, it  creates mental chaos (cause inside of myself I am not sure what is true). if I only speak what I believe to be true, then I don't have to remember all those other "truths" that I told, to try to make my words coherent and not contradict myself: it is an unnecessary mental burden to try and keep all of your untruths in order.

as I began my transformation I -- for whatever reason, I think it was raquel and my constant embellishment with augusto which got me nowhere -- that I began to remove the little "white" lies and exaggerations from my speech. every time I became more honest with the person I was telling my story to, I found myself feeling lighter and lighter every time I began to tell more what really happened instead of what I think the person would want to hear happened (to maximise their sympathy for me or whatever). what was happening was, I was becoming more honest with myself.

I was finding that when my mind is constantly organising untruths, then I became accustomed to working with untruths and (besides the attractive power of that) my mind could really figure out what is truth because it was not accustomed to working with truth (it was use to processing untruth). when I processed only truth in my head, other people's dishonesty became much more apparent to me. when they were dishonest with me (or with themselves), I would feel uneasy. I really began to feel noticeable discord around a lot of people (most people are very dishonest with themselves and others) so I reacted by becoming extreme in my honesty. when normally a person would try to pass over an uncomfortable subject, I would tend to dive right in to it because I liked that feeling of freedom as I could express myself on a subject in a way that was not expected by society. [1][2]

if I were to tell my friends that some thing is awesome, when in reality I think it is a giant turd -- every time I tell them it is awesome, I am usually more aware of its unawesomeness than its awesomeness. that's why often times my friends don't believe me, because they sense the emptiness of my words. I also have a hard time believing myself -- and this really is the core of what I am getting at here. until you are able to be honest with yourself, you will have a hard time believing yourself.

finally, I want to conclude by saying that most of the major mental changes that happened to me while watching stars were exercises in becoming more honest with myself. it would be accurate to say in my opinion, that the more honest with myself I became the better things look for me.

## 2. be shameless about everything

[???] shame comes from noticing disapproval from others or practicing your own thoughts of disapproval. either way this is an emotional reaction that we are not born with. our parents, our peers, and anyone else wanting to modify your behaviour to something more pleasing to them would disapprove of your behaviour. the shame you feel can be thought of as a defence mechanism to avoid repeat disapproval. however, it is not your job to perform in a way that is pleasing to others.

sure, it feels good when you perform in such a way that others respond to you positively, but you cannot easily identify other's expectations for you. in the case of your parents, if they desire for you to do well in school and they see you studying, you should feel some sort of positive feedback from them as they watch you study. however if they see you playing the nintendo instead of doing your homework, you may feel some sort of negative feedback. (usually whenever I feel this negative feedback, I feel it in my heart. it feels like a strong heart beat with a feeling of anger, pain or frustration that isn't mine)

## 3. learn to not care about what other people are thinking about you -- especially your parents.

[...] something about learning approval

## 4. train your sensitivity to other people's thought

I know this sounds contradictory to the previous section, but since we cannot help it, and since we're raised seeking the approval of others, most of us out there are already quite sensitive to what we think other people think. first of all, I found out I almost always wrong about what I thought other people were thinking about me -- that's why the previous point is so important

## 5. speak more emotionally

let's say that someone is trying to pin you down based on something you said or did. instead of trying to lie and say it was something different, justify it, make excuses, or deny it in some way -- really, the easiest way is just to respond with how you felt in that moment.

if things are already kind of in a rough spot, and you still want to react, but react more intelligently; here are a few ideas to get you started

# show them how powerful negative focus is

you can do this easily by finding something that they do not like about themselves (or something that they like, but that's a bit harder) and focus on it negatively. for example, imagine that you can tell that your mom is concerned with her weight or with her income. focus in your mind about how fat she is, how she's getting fatter, how her clothes no linger fit, etc. try to hold that thought or picture in your mind for over a minute and then just let LOA just do the rest. her attention to her weight will heighten and she begin having things happen in her life to prove to her she's getting fatter, and things will get worse.

at some point in time things will get pretty bad so don't do it too much or often, and when they begin to blame you (that is usually one of the first things that happens) you can explain to them that someone else's focus should not have an impact on their life, however it does have an effect, so you would really enjoy that since they've got their nose in your business, you would prefer that they (no matter what they're observing) try to find a positive conclusion they can think about it -- because no one can really observe someone they care about without having an opinion about the things they're doing.

##### notes

1. the culmination of my extreme honesty came when I told zaryn (and a bunch of others around the table) how I lost my virginity. I thought to myself, "man, I no longer have anything to hide if I can be that honest about that subject." well, that was before I knew I was on nosebook and was having everything broadcast -- so I guess I still had some more extreme honesty to realise in the future.

2. in a way these documents are also a further manifestation of this extreme honesty -- and as I began thinking of the project while watching stars, most of my major vision upgrades have come as a result of me becoming ok with being more honest in text. the idea came to me out of a bit of defensiveness, and wanting to change things, but as I began to see more of the positive aspects of nosebook for all of us, and how
