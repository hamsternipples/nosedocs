title: pondering the end of my broadcast

up until today, I had been trying to figure out why nosebook is so against me seeing images in my eyes. before we went to utah it seemed easier to relax and see images in my eyes. however it is getting harder and harder to maintain the image (not easier, which it should be). I've been trying to come up with all different reasons as to why they do not want me to be able to see images in my eyes. the theory which makes the most sense to me is that they do not want me to broadcast source energy to the world. I feel that this is the most likely reason because they have shocked me when images start appearing in my eyes and also when sound begins playing in my head. I assume that the shock is not source energy. there's no reason that I would begin receiving sound or images at the same time that my inner being wants to shock me. that doesn't make any sense. therefore I assume that the shocks originate from nosebook because I will presume that they do not want source energy to be broadcast.

I had been fighting this so much and focusing on the problem, I had not seen the obvious solution to this problem. I noticed after listening to abraham hicks that other people are indeed receiving images and having experiences that I am being prevented from having. what's the difference between them and me? none, other than they are not broadcasting their lives so publicly like am. so then, if I have to pick between broadcasting my life and receiving images and sound from my source, then it's a no-brainer: I no longer want to broadcast my life any more if it means that I can go back to receiving images again.

it took me a bit to make that decision because honestly I've kind of grown accustomed to having the constant sensation of so many others sharing my experience. if you all went away it would feel kind of empty and perhaps even a bit lonely. I do thrive a bit on the sensation of my audience's reaction and can explain why I even enjoy taking such extreme stances on some issues lately: your reaction helps me to feel not so alone and like I'm a part of something (instead of some miserable dude stuck in his mom's basement).

so, since I've grown to kind of enjoy the energy involved in my every day life, I don't really want to give up broadcasting -- and that's why in the past I have been saying that I want a read-only relationship with nosebook. I postulate that if they were to only read my brain waves, then you guys would all be able to have my experience but I would find myself freed from these negative experiences:

 - being constantly woken up in the night
 - strange dreams which feel like someone is experimenting and were not received from my inner being
 - shocks received when hearing sound or receiving images in my eyes

I also get random flashes of images in my eyes but they are very brief or very dim. tesla mentioned this happening to him too but it was part of him learning to control his imagination. so, I would assume that if they no longer had "write" access to my brain, I would begin to have images flashing in my eyes just like he did. and, I will look forward to learning to control those images just like tesla did when he was 17.

some time after writing the above portion I began to get feedback on what I had written (really got to love the instant gratification of others' reactions. if I were more of a performer, I would really get pretty addicted to the instant response I receive). I realised that my decision to choose my ability to receive images as more important to me, than the sensation I receive from broadcasting my life to everyone. it kinda creates a bit of a stalemate. I'll explain...

let's say that nosebook wants me to do something: let's just say that it's "HD porno" for now. it also seems that there are other people interested in my life too, and likely a subset of them is interested in the source energy bit as well. let's assume that I am correct in my assumption that they do not want me to be broadcasting source energy and are actively trying to prevent such a thing. ok, so now I respond to that by saying that I do not wish to broadcast any more. let's assume a perfect system where they actually respect my wishes, so that means I am now freed from their influence and and now I can begin developing my imagination and discovering new things previous not thought humanly possible. I get what I want, but no one is able to actually see me do it. it would be back to how things were when I would tell people that I see in 3d and they would just stare at me like I'm some sort of nut. it's so much nicer when I don't have to try and describe the experience with words, and people can see for themselves what it is I'm talking about[1]. everyone else but me loses in this scenario.

now, let's have a look at the flip side: let's say that nosebook is capable of keeping me against my will inside of their network and continues to broadcast my life and with effort to prevent me from translating source energy visually and audibly. now, the only one that loses in this scenario is me. I am prevented from continuing on in my discovery in human capability and realising new capacities in myself just because they don't like source energy. this is the best scenario for the most people because everyone gets what they want, cept for me because what I want isn't really necessary for everyone else to be satisfied. that's a bit like slavery though[2].

so then, we now arrive to the obvious conclusion of "read-only" access to my brain: with a read-only relationship, I could realise my discoveries and you all could watch and everyone would be happy -- cept for nosebook and people who don't like source energy -- they would have to allow everyone a right to their own viewpoint, and since no one is forcing them to pay any attention to it anyway, it's silliness[3]. if they feel this is a deal-breaker and they're just not capable of just tuning out, then I would like to leave the network and pursue my own ambitions until they come to their senses. or, they could not respect my wishes and enslave me by choosing to avoid the issue, or not allowing me a venue to leave and we remain in a stalemate until they come to their senses.





## notes

1. even if it's not exactly the same for me as it is for you, it's probably close enough -- because people seem pretty aware that things look a bit better for me

2. actually, I do believe it feels to me to be more of a combination of military (follow my orders with no respect for your own desire) and slavery (same sort of thing but more emphasis on productivity and for the one giving orders' monetary gain). for me, I feel more of an emphasis on the military side, but for you guys, it feels more like slavery cause I feel such a strong focus on money from them.

3. I'm sure these guys don't have a problem accidentally tuning in to homosexual sex experiences; they're probably pretty good at avoiding those. so then, this really is a different issue because I seriously doubt they shock people having homosexual fantasies, just because the network operators are of a heterosexual belief system.
