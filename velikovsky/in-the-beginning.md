[According to Hesiod, the catastrophe described as the removal of Uranus by Saturn gave birth to Aphrodite. In Worlds in Collision Aphrodite was identified with the Moon.]

moon was originally closer to the earth, 1.5 times the size it is now. its orbit also changed quite a few times

proceeding the deluge caused by (comets?) saturn, there was 7 days of bright light. in my own experience, I have seen this bright light -- it's a psychedelic condition, where I could see at night as if it were day. additionally, I have noted that on mushroom experience when I "saw" and experienced a part of jesus' life, there was tremendous golden light on the planet. when he died, this light went away. in conjunction with velikovsky's conclusion that likely the flare up occurred from saturn in an earth-directed CME, the electrical properties could easily have caused this psychedelic mental condition.

saturn is associated with cold and water.

again, I am noticing that people's beliefs about things seems to become reality much more rapidly in the past than it does now. it gives me the sense that likely the whole idealised pre-eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was essentially like living in a dream or a very psychedelic condition -- (with a very high *hQ* rating) and then following it, learning to distinguish the difference between something (gaining a pre-frontal cortex), we began attracting unwanted things at an unprecedented rate (because of the high *hQ* rating).

it's almost as if I'm getting the picture that humans used to live in a very psychedelic state of existence[%1], but then we grew the neocortex and began to attract things quickly. then these giants showed up (the INFECTED ONES arriving from mars, like was mentioned in "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI"), and they were very violent and destructive, taking for themselves the women of the planet[^2].

following the appearance of the giants, cain killing seth, etc. there were many catastrophes as humans, now combined with the giants, we're to begin learning how to be more deliberate in our creation, rather than giving a lot of attention to unwanted stuff, and get bad stuff.

after so many catastrophes, I think there is a bit of a fear to recognise these past events, for fear that similar ones will repeat. as a result, different sciences and religions sell the idea that things are in order, have been in order for a very very long time, and will continue on in order, almost as if it were to quell the fearful people in charge[^3].

this new paradigm of business as usual[^4] has extended into almost every facet of society now, as if it's some sort of safeguard against catastrophe -- and it is, kinda. if people believe in catastrophe, then catastrophes will come. if people believe it's business as usual for the last billions of years, then it'll be more and more of the same[^5].

this is still not effective creation: it's burying your head in the sand and getting people to spin their wheels on ideas which don't go anywhere for fear that, instead of just learning to give your attention to what is wanted[^6].

so it seems that our planet has lost a lot of its conditional methods for making *hQ*[^7], meaning that it's lost the alignment hat it originally had, and combined with other catastrophes, the amount of *hQ* that creates advances by turning thoughts into things has been reduced. after eating this forbidden substance, man was cast out of an ideal environment and he himself fell removed himself from this environment with his own thoughts (cause of the high *hQ*). this was the "fall of man"[^8].

however, it seems that humankind is on the comeback though. it appears that the people in charge have created a system which excites different parts of the brain to begin expanding people's capacity to experience this *hQ* internally. they may be able to keep the *hQ* factor low in the environment, but it's rising quickly in the population.

is is exactly opposite of what was happening in previous times, when the environment saturated with *hQ* permeated the minds of the early humans. now, it appears that a rise in the *hQ* internal to the human is beginning to have an effect on the environment as well.

my theory is that as man begins to come into equilibrium with his environment, man will bring the *hQ* levels of the environment to reflect those of his mind[^10] there will be a return of these initial conditions that were "lost" in the expulsion of man from his ideal environment; the prodigal son.

[1]: see food of the goods by terence mckenna for more ideas on this. additionally, if the moon was 150% the size it is now, it was much closer to earth, so its effect would be stronger. additionally, the earth seemed to have a perfect 360 day year and a perfect 30 day moon cycle (month). combined with my own psychedelic experiences with planetary and lunar alignments, I consider this sufficient evidence that things were way more psychedelic back then.

[2]: the idea that giants could reproduce with humans would not work because of the way genes and species works, unless it was planned that the capture colony on mars would be genetically capable of reproducing with the race of humans on earth. so, if they did reproduce successfully, this must have been planned.

[3]: actually, I'm beginning to get the sense that so much of NASA is running the way it is, because their bosses are fearful of things happening out of their control and want an answer that falls in line with the scientific coddling of people's fears by selling this business as usual (only gradual, no big changes) for a long time position of faith. this occurs likely because scientific understanding does not accurately explain many things, and to take a different perspective (one that works), recent catastrophes would have to be recognised, and since the peple in charge don't want to hear the most reasonable explanation, for fear these catastrophes once again cause them to lose positions of control, they find people to tell them what they want to hear[^6].

[4]: I find it funny that the whole concept of nosebook is teaching people to behave as if it's business as usual, and to continue using old outdated technology, even though people are now operating a computer with their mind (I don't know what johnathan ranted about, but I imagine it was something about this.. we can do things with our mind, and I still have to use this crappy iphone which doesn't do what I want. I have to go trough a bunch of useless menus to find something ... etc.)

[5]: in another stream johnathan was complaining about how there has been no major (paradigm shifting) scientific advances in a long time, citing the saturn V rocket as one example, and mobile phones as another. I replied on YT in a comment saying that we are using super amazing technology, and it'll eventually revolutionise almost every aspect of society.

[6]: this has been experienced by me with my interaction with zaryn and erik. zaryn just wanted to hear what he wanted to hear from erik. he found it impossible to give his attention to what was wanted, all the time fearing that facebook would translate and his domination in spain would be taken away from him. erik was a valuable asset to sell the company, and erik told him what he wanted to hear, so like mainstream cosmology which explains almost nothing, it was what the guy in charge wants to hear, so he feels like he won't lost his dominating position to something out of his control. the irony is, his own thoughts and beliefs are in his control, and that's all that matters.

[7]: personally, I have experienced this *hQ* both internally and externally. when I perceive it in my environment, it appears to me like a golden glow that seems to provide a feeling of warmth and depth to everything. I have always associated it with thoughts becoming manifest very quickly. in other places (before I knew what I was looking at), I've seen it in psychedelic experiences, and inside of my head (and sometimes in the back of my eyes) when I watch stars. I believe it's perceptually induced by the psychoactive neurotransmitter our brain synthesises, DMT, however, I believe that certain electrical environments must make these psychedelic states more attainable. certainly nosebook is working quite hard to neutralise that electrical environment. it also seems that someone like me with very high levels of DMT (as evidenced my my vision) seems to have an effect on the environment as well. the golden glow seems to have properties similar to thermodynamics where the internal system wants to come into thermal equilibrium with the containing cavity.

[8]: when I present the story in this way, it becomes apparent to me how similar the story is to my own. I had a very good thing going when conditions were good, I created the reality that I wanted, but I was na√Øve. then, because of various new circumstances, the same reality creation capability I had created difficult circumstances. however, I didn't have fear of being banished from my ideal circumstances (cause I already was), I decided to begin the process of recovery my way. I ate a lot of a forbidden mushrooms and gained a new understanding of how all things worked.

[10]: I see this all the time. if nosebook weren't spraying all the time clouds in the sky, the environment around me would perfectly reflect the way I am. it it would be more similar to a rainforest, where when it wants to rain, it rans quickly then goes back quickly to sunny. if I desire warm, the day would warm up, if I desire cool, the day would cool down. when the plants desire water, it rains -- it would work similar to the garden of eden days.

saturn and jupiter used to be much brighter in the night sky. they were even likely to be visible at daytime as well, assuming the conditions were sufficient. this tends to imply that they were luminaries in the sky similar to how the sun is now. assuming his slow orbit traveling very small distances across the sky, it would have had a similar effect to having the sun rise.

the 7 days that passed where everything was aglow, we know that saturn is a brown dwarf and that they flare very violently, it seems quite plausible that the flare ionised everything immediately and then 7 days later, the CME hits the earth, and just like it does now, an intensification in solar wind, intensifies a lot of storms.

velikovsky hypothesises that saturn caused widespread of seed throughout the earth to account for the sudden appearance of new lifeforms. I believe that may have had an effect, but a lesser one than the mutations caused in the DNA by the 7-days of light prior to the deluge. following the sirian's account of the story, that means they would have dropped the mars guys off to give them sufficient time to reproduce and gain the vibration of human DNA, sufficiently enough for them to be locked to the earth for any future incarnations, knowing that in just a few generations, saturn would explode and cause a catastrophe which would wipe out the giants as a species, locking the INFECTED ONES into future incarnation only in the human body (no longer having physical dominance of size and strength).
