#### aries (belief -> sacrifice)

the beginning of the masculine, "I create my own reality" trend[^1]. things got chaotic quickly though as many people's negative perceptions were causing all sorts of havoc on crops and making survival difficult.

this is the era of belief. if you believe you could conquest some great city, you could. if you believe whatever, it is possible. this began to create havoc for some people who believed bad things would happen to them because of their "sins"

sacrifice came about as a tool to connect that belief by taking someone's mind off of the negative perspective causing the chaos and refocus it on abundance or some greater good. this change in mindset changes the way you feel, and therefore your reality.

#### piscis (faith/value -> social-empowerment)

since some people were having all of the success, making them believe they were successful, LOA just gave them more success, so it began to create a new lower-class of people who did not believe themselves to be valuable enough to receive this success, too.

along comes jesus and he starts telling people that they are valuable enough as they are. they do not need to make actions to allow theirselves to believe in something. they don't need anything sold by the pharisees, because it was just a con-game anyway.

this is now the era of value, and it pretty much sets into motion the whole capitalism and church hoarding the value by making people pay to have their sins absolved.

much time passes this way, and then the reformation of the church begins to take place, and now with the power of the printing press, things take on a new turn. the powerful church no longer holds all of the control. now, information can be copied quite easily and so now the perception of power begins to become the power of the group.

sacrifice (or service) becomes the way people are kept from realising their value by offering them a diminished sense of capability.

#### aquarius (capability -> ???)

lots of people were left from the previous era, feeling disempowered and under valued (women, gays, minorities, etc), and most of it stems from a lack of self-valuation or self-esteem. meaning that the root of their disempowerment belief is self-inflicted. there are countless examples of people rising from humble circumstances into higher perceived value (social-standing or monetary), and my experience says that it has to do with the person's personal self-valuation which makes this difference.

social-empowerment (or popular belief) becomes the new way to keep people from realising their capability.

[1]: assuming terence is right in "food of the gods", psilocybin mushrooms were responsible for creating massive growth in the pre-frontal cortex in a very sort period of time, and this happened in primates which already had male dominance hieararchies. (also interesting to note that my whole experience began with the mushrooms as well)
