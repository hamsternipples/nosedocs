title: further discussion and potential futures

hey,

so now, I'd like to take some time to talk about some ideas for some potential futures...

I want to first begin by saying that in my previous expansion into who I am today, many would consider that I passed through great loss, but it was nothing more than an optimisation process. in computer science, if you can rewrite the same program to be faster, consume less memory, and also less code, you will have succeeded in successfully optimising your program. though the program may turn out to be a modest 20% lighter, it is, in fact possible, that more than 40% of the code has changed -- usually more. this is the same thing that is happening to me: large sections of my physical "implementation" are being removed to be rewritten. so, this "loss" is not really a loss. it's much more comparable to the demolition of an existing structure, so that the new one can be built.

they will lie to me about whatever they think I want to hear
probably whatever they are telling you is also a lie. what is in their best interest. would it improve things if they were honest
