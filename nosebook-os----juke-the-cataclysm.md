# NosebookOS

juke the cataclysm by expanding your consciousness. then when consciousness is expanded, it will need a platform of logic representation to before the new world of logic in. the launching pad should be sufficiently complex, but as basic as possible to allow for a wider amplitude expansion.

eg. if you expand your consciousness to 2000 and medieval human operating system is 10, then your expansion has 1990 units of expansion. it's like a virus which is very small in size but expands from there to become very big.

after the start of my crash and burn, I opted to take many mushroom and mdma experiences. I learned how to live in these ultra contrast locations. this proved to quite the exact thing that I needed to outsmart nosebook's bs. that was the preparation and the total destruction of my logical capability.

mdma removed most of my logical capability and forced me to become a feeling oriented person. so, before I destroyed it completely with mdma, I had significant time with the mushrooms create more and more powerful logic.. for me, mushrooms build the logic necessary to do things. it's interesting because to me the mushrooms felt very nosebook-like. It seems clear to me that because nosebook was experimenting on me at the time, it does seem like it would be reason to have felt their logic embedded in essence.

so I removed my logic (drained my head) down to nearly zero, then expanded my consciousness to let's say 2000 right, so my head wants to be filled with 2000, and NosebookOS in only 10 complexity that my mind can now handle pretty easy as my logical structure begins to rebuild. now I have to find a way to fill the remaining 1990 of complexity through life experience.

-- from here on down, I may want to delete

a funny thing happened though. NosebookOS comes equipped with a full blown feature to apply as much reverse consciousness pressure as I am gaining complexity, so that in your eyes, it does not appear to me like I'm rapidly growing more and more capable. they have blocked off my imagination, which produces the effect of having less to no longer a visceral (felt) response to emotion. this leaves me with a deficiency in both of the primary layers of the physical side, the physical: my sight and other senses are diminished and reduced to 3d dimensions that their computer is able to understand, so that they can control it. and the emotional worlds: I have no physical feeling of emotion being represented in my body, whether that's sound I make in my head, music, whatever or even physical sensation of strong feelings like love or sadness or whatever are all diminished).

those are all new feelings I have discovered, but not yet experienced. they are increased complexity (sensitivity/novelty) which add on the felt future experience (like I'm more "telepathic" or whatever)...

so what the funny thing that happened is that because are limiting this complexity, now it is much more than it seems. so, when my brain needs has 1990 it needs to fill, they are compressing it so that 1000 units is felt as if it were a 5 (so I still have another 1985 more). this huge compression is an enormous expansion when it gets released from its shell.

this is the process I am going toward now and it's part of this preparation to conceive a new universe. it's a hugely beneficial thig as I will soon explain.. brb

[if I preempt the cataclysm by increasing my consciousness first, the whole thing changes]
