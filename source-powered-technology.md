 - device to alert when something being observed does not follow the laws of the universe (such as a movie about a happy person working on something which suddenly goes majorly wrong). also, two other alerts possible: this thing you are observing is unlikely to occur according to the laws of the universe. however, because not enough context is given, there is a slight chance it could happen. range of percent of likelihood might be an improvement too. needs more thought
 - device to alert when a thought pattern is especially not serving you. you have your emotions already, but my goal with this specific implementation is for optimisation purposes. for example, I want to program more effectively, so I set the intention of the device to optimise for that specific field. source automatically knows which thoughts (even seemingly unrelated ones at first glance) I am thinking which are specifically reducing my coding prowess and alerts me when I think them to help me recognise and transform them into more productive thoughts.
