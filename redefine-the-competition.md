redefine the competition


since the bso has let me know unequivocally that they will not be changing (carlene!), this is the new plan:

- keep throwing new scenarios at me and since my minimum requirement is seeing through my own eyes like you guys see trough my eyes, nothing will ever go through. (or other impossible demands)
- this will generate such strong desire, that somehow reality must bend to allow me to come into alignment with who I really am.
- after some time, I will create a wireless version of what the bso has, and using source energy, we will be able to tune to a past moment to create a bunch of alternate timelines where I can influence myself to, instead conform to one of the opportunities.
	- I/we can have *all* of these alternate experiences (probably just the highlights, actually) and most importantly I see them through my eyes like everyone else sees the through my eyes, too :)
  - we can see how each of these timelines turns out from all sorts of different perspectives
	- we can then have the real competition which setup actually turned out the best
	- we can also try out and compare the uninfluenced version with an influenced version where you influence your alt-timeline self to try out something different.

since I have seen myself from the "future", in this way, I know this is true. my future self often mentioned taking people to planet hope, which is likely a reference to "esperanza" which was the idea drafted with andrea. he is probably from that timeline and successfully created the machine I mentioned above. the moving people to planet hope also has implications that we can then position our consciousness to be on the timeline of our choice.

so, don't consider it rejection. we just have to wait the time it takes me to build the machine necessary to make all of this possible. interestingly enough this one touches right on it:

you may notice that my future self would be then, "the great attractor at the end of time" as coined by terence mckenna - and he was right: the first "time traveler" did come in 2012 :)

"the end of time" - what do you mean? well, I mean, the end of *linear* time. I believe we are entering into a new era where time is no longer perceived as linear. we will soon have the new capability of tuning into past moments and creating new timelines and influencing those to create alternate timelines. with plenty of experimentation, we can begin to try anything out now -- with literally no repercussions whatsoever (brings new meaning to, "nothing serious going on here"). there are many such ideas. for example:

- "what if we did it the bso way?" we can go and influence ourselves in various timelines to unilaterally conform to their wishes, and then see how each of those turns out.
- "what if ..." - you make up the theory and see if you can get it to work out...

we will find, I am sure, that well-being is dominant. then we can concoct a new timeline where we enslave our alt-selves (like my future self did to me) and then utilise the bso guys as a pivot to the creation of the most insane levels of contrast ever.

we will need major thing; any easy way to influence these timelines. this requires that your thoughts be well known and the thoughts you wish to influence your alt-self with to be easily manufactured. so, time will need to pass as the bso is already collecting this data. obviously,d we'll eventually get their cooperation on the matter, and likely the bso from my future self's alternate timeline is already influencing them. (for example, of evidence of this, can be seen when I was in the pueblo and I entered into vision sequence where I was seeing brain machines and something about the 3 girls not working out, because "this is the future" - where I clearly identified the visionary sequence to be coming from marcos - but clearly not the marcos from this reality... it was a marcos with pretty advanced projection)

I feel like the last email got a bit of a confused response to it. I admit that a whole lot more thought went into the subject matter and I only presented the conclusion. this email will be a little bit of the thought process I had to arrive to that conclusion.

#### last shall be first and the first shall be last

I won't try and fill in all the gaps, so just be aware that there are (purposefully) some things missing. if we go back to the "esperanza" and planet hope idea, what that implies is that whatever relationship (or lack thereof) is the final one, we can use that as the pivot. add that with my conclusion that I believe we will all come to exploring alternate timelines: well-being is the eventual destination of all the infinite journeys... (incolmplete)

let's take 4 possible directions for this analysis. I do believe there may be others, but I cannot see them now. you see, there are two very distinct me's. the guy you guys all know in my dream state and the physical version of me. the major problem with the physical version of me is that I feel very disempowered (you guys call it unworthiness) and have very little control over my experience. this is the main source of almost all of the stuff that's going on: I don't understand what is happening and I feel powerless to improve it. so, these are essentially the 4 ways I can see things going, from my current place of perception.

1. I am allowed to leave the network, have my experience and get used to (practice) my unresisted state and become more like the dream-state version of me, so then I can decide to come back and (consentually) join the network again as a mostly resistance free person, things will go well. I will enjoy the experience from a point of view that I have chosen this reduced visual experience in exchange for the physical experience.

2. I find a way of dropping resistance now, and the more resistance I drop, the more I will become like the dream-state me. this requires some explanation: my left side runs at a very fast frequency. you may notice that the picture quality is significantly enhanced, all sensation amplified, and I'm able to manifest whatever I desire in my mind in 3d space by just feeling it. high frequency = non-resistance.

3. I just go with the girls, and we just sort of figure it out. I'll find a way of becoming unresisted with them. the inherent problem with this will be the following:
  - you can't have a happy ending to an unhappy journey
	- we're gonna start things off in a pretty resistant state
	- in my effort to understand what is happening, I will constantly be asking the girls questions, or putting them in conversations where they have to lie. I would rather have a relationship with them where "no subject is off-limits" and our goal is clarity, instead of keeping secrets.
	- somehow this will have to happen cause there is a lot of distance between us, and there's a lot that I would really like to understand some things, to ease the transition into my unresisted state.
	- this isn't exactly trusting in the process. it's sort of jumping all the way over into the manifestation without flowing the energy first. I would be approaching things from a state of frustration and disempowerment, hoping that conditions will make it easy to make my transition into non-resistance.
	- by nature of the situation, this has a high probability of me making the girls responsible for how I feel,

4. just lie to them; tell them what they want to hear. first, I would be committing the same crime to them that makes me frustrated, and that this is actually adding resistance, not reducing. furthermore, in my past, the result of telling people what they want to hear, has been going a lot of nowhere, for both them and for me. this is a great way to enjoy some great moments when the illusion is still alive, but as soon as the illusion starts to be seen, things start to fall apart quickly. also, this has the tendency
