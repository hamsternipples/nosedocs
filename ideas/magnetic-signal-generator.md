# magnetic signal generator and feedback mechanism

### inspiration

1. watching Daði Freyr play his songs in his room (or often I see DJs finely adjusting the volume), but it looks like he's trying to transmit some sort of feeling into the music while it's playing that part and doesn't really have a good way of modifying something that's already predefined, much more than slightly adjusting the volume.
2. watching the kid in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU) hitting the joystick to the beat.
3. watching the different interactions of magnetism on aluminium with professor eric laithwaite: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJfqMYHaQw) and @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI_HFnNTfyU)

so, what I want is a joystick like thing (or perhaps a smaller knob too about the size of a traditional volume volume pot on an amp).

### basic design

the way it would work is similar to the magnetic current in that video where the magnetism would have a flow to it. I will visualise it as an aluminium rod positioned to stand vertically (like a joystick). the most simple design would have 4 coils in n-s-e-w configuration surrounding the aluminium rod. then, the surrounding coils around that one would be configured so that they would constantly "pull" the aluminium rod in a downward direction, however about a quarter of the way up from the bottom of the aluminium rod, it would have some sort of clasp or something to fix it to the base and prevent it from being shot out like a projectile. the part below the clasp should be free to move about between the 4 directional coils (and surrounding opposite one).

just like in the magnetic river video, the 4 inner coils would use AC to be configured at one phase, then the surrounding outer coil out of phase, to create the magnetic river (which constantly tries to push the aluminium rod downward).

in those magnetic river videos you can hear the AC power supply make a churning sound when he puts the aluminium next to the coils. this, I think, is because aluminium is diamagnetic, so it exerts a smaller opposite magnetic field when a magnetic field is in its vicinity. this means that the AC power supply will be receiving "back emf" from the movement of the aluminium in presence of the magnetic field of the coil.

what then needs to be done is to take those weak emf signals generated from the AC coils (probably the 4 directional ones) and clean and amplify them into a signal which can then be used to modulate a synth, essentially like a signal generator.

### future direction

the directional coils can also be slightly energised as well to give the "force feedback" sensation that some part of the signal is acting on the lever (and the musician holding it) further enhancing the "struggle" and amplifying the signal feedback coming out of the level.

obviously more directional coils can be added vertically and radially increasing resolution, and the clasp is a bit crude as well. most of the improvement can be made on the circuit to capture the back emf, where I believe it's possible (don't understand tesla coils well enough to be able to tell you how yet), that just placing your hand in the vicinity of the aluminium rod, or touching it slightly should already be generating a signal.

further sensitivity can likely be achieved, pulling signals right out of the air, for say a good way to get "feedback" from the crowd during a concert.
