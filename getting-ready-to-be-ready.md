a placeholder for now. I want to outline different goals as stuff that I want to realise as I get ready to be ready. I have some ideas, stuff like fixing my teeth, and I want to categorise them into categories of things that I can achieve myself, appearance... stuff like that.

- freeing up of my translation capacity. I want to be able to conjure images and sound inside of my head. probably the nexus idea would be best for this.
  - I will be writing a future entry about the differences between the uncontrollable visual capacity, and the controllable visual capacity. I believe this is already in effect, so that means they already have a first implementation of the nexus idea already in production used to control people's imagination.
	- it's possible that a nexus-like idea is also used for the language specific translations of my thoughts. so, they're already practically there. they just need to start using it for english now too.
	- likely one of the necessary requirements from a technical standpoint. from a desire standpoint, for them this is a blocker to giving me my visual capacity. from me, it's a dealbreaker -- especially when they're so close and I've given them already a solution.
