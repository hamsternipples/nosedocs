# the seductive power of honesty: it's endearing

when I was younger, I really disliked magic tricks. the magician first, by stating a few observationally true things, establishes the foundation of
 truthiness upon which the trick will be performed. the performer then goes on to do some process which you do not know the inner workings to perform something in front of your eyes which appears to bend reality in some way. the substance of the trick is, in the misunderstanding of what is really happening in that process.[1]

I thought this was magic -- until I met trump. let me explain. I don't really like deception (the original reason for my dislike of magic when I was younger) and watching magicians perform in magic shows made me walk away from it feeling like I was deceived. [2] trump has the habit of revealing his trick for whatever reason [3]. remember draining the swamp?

trump has an incredible eye for noticing the performance of different phrases. you can see him revealing his motivation in that clip. trevor noah and john oliver have been most keen on this, and since I have also, in the past, done similar, I paid special attention. this is something truly special. this is an illusion, where the contents of the mysterious process can be fully perceived and improved upon as out in the open. trump too is sensitive to the audience's reaction, and so therefore the real-time feedback actually makes the illusion more robust. I appreciated this technique so much, I have since adapted it to be my own.

at the time of writing there is a tirade of sexual allegations hitting the news for famous people. our president is no exception. where trump differs from the competition though is he again reveals his trick to howard stern on his show. I really appreciate howard stern and have studied him and adapted quite a few of his techniques as well. listening to a howard stern show is interesting because he is quite adept at getting the truth out of his unsuspecting interviewee by getting them to clarify howard's (purposeful) misunderstanding of what is going on, or by allowing them ample time to justify themselves after digging them a hole, and throwing them in them with his words. he is in the business of getting people to be honest with themselves, then take ownership of that in a non-judgmental way and then allows them the freedom to feel about it how they wish. I really really like howard stern because, like me, he too got a lot of his attention early on using the shock-factor, then following up with a logical or insightful observation.

1. arthur c clarke is famous for saying, "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I interpret that to mean that the sufficiently advanced technology is a process which is not yet understood because of na√Øvety to the understanding of how that technology works.

2. I also dislike "hypnotists" for the same reason. after the experience I tend to come away from it feeling like I was being deceived (or coerced) into believing something that I otherwise would not. [[subject for a future article on the power of hypnotism in a non deceptive emotionally liberating way (which I learned initially from pierre)]]

3. sometime it appears that he is revealing the trick to showing off his cleverness to get around some mental structure erected in societal norms. sometimes not, however, in my case that is almost always the reason why I am revealing the trick.
