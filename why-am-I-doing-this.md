what is it that I'm really looking for?

 -> how did I get here

why do I think this is a good idea?

 -> trying to get my energy flowing, and at least I can be a part of some creative process. also helping to feel more satisfaction where we are now (and not needing things to be different: nosebook is nosebook and they are where they are and I don't need them to be different. in fact, I would like to aid them a little more in being who they are.

also, part of giving up the struggle

everything I'm looking for is just "a way of thinking" away from reality. all I have to "do" is just learn a new way of thinking which is compatible with its reality
(thought-path: a way of thinking which will lead me toward whatever I'm looking for -- think about finding a way to solve the programming bug)

cause, what I'm really looking for is the improved way of thinking. what I was looking for was just the excuse to realise this new form of thought.
