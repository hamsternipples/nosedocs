it looks to me like the pair: nh2 -> o is something that stores a value. it seems to me that the most likely version of this is that the oxygen stores a voltage which it probably receives as feedback from the previous pair in the sequence.

I would then reason that the n -> hn stores the sign of the value (positive or negative)

so following that, the o -> h2n pair is also storing a value, but in the reverse direction. I don't know much about dna, but it seems to me that this is likely a feedback mechanism.

one could imagine that with a reverse direction to give feedback, more advanced operations such as division could be performed quite easily (similar to how a microprocessor's ALU does division).

so, the forward direction values are added (along with the sign) to the next one in the sequence, then the reverse direction value should probably be added to the previous one in the sequence. sinusoidal waveforms could easily be created by alternating the values going forward and reverse. with the addition of knowledge of where these sequences fold, geometric shapes can be created pretty easily. this is likely the electrical structure which determines where the 3d positions for the proteins to go. probably the reason why scars exist for a while, but go away gradually as this vibrational structure returns to have its shape again (and not chaotic voltages stored in the oxygens)

nh2 -> o (forward direction value)
n -> hn (value sign)

nh2 -> o (forward direction value)
n -> hn (value sign)
o -> h2n (reverse direction value)

o -> nh2 (reverse direction value)
nh -> n (value sign)

o -> nh2 (reverse direction value)
nh -> n (value sign)
h2n -> o (forward direction value)
