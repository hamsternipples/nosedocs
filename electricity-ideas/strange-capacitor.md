super dielectric materials (sdm) have a high k value. this is opposite to the technique of utilising graphene as a high surface area electrode. having a material with a high k value means that capacitance goes up when the two current collectors are closer together (however, the breakdown voltage will probably be lower). it also makes them an electrostatic capacitor instead of a supercapacitor.

rob further improved upon this k value with his realisation that salt, sugar, and oil make a good [forgot the name of it] by essentially making all sorts of mini capacitors inside of suspended in the oil (or resin).

### things to note

- salt, oil (fat), and sugar combo is probably how muscles work as energy storage devices for the human body
  - interesting thing would be to see chemically why this increases the k-value
- the k-value is unrelated to breakdown voltage, (so, like rob mentions, an interesting thing to note would be the frequency response)
- there's probably something to the idea that an increase in a k-value increases capacitance, yet at the same time moving the electrodes closer together increases capacity, yet at the same time decreases breakdown voltage, yet a higher voltage means much greater energy storage
  - k-value /=/ capacitance
	- distance /=/ voltage /=/ -capacitance
	- voltage /^2/ capacitance

this must be why telsa always opted to use higher voltages, constantly measuring the size of his discharge
