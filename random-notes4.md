start off with something that I do not believe yet
not, I want things to be different than they are?

---

everyday do another
start with one in the center that is blank:
- start general, and up the speed wiih general statements
- gradually get more specific, following the impulse of what comes
- finally, the middle takes form and it becomes obvious what is in the middle

---

my resistance is probably as simple as observing the absence of something wanted

I will no longer tell it like it is -- instead I'm going to tell it like I want it to be

write a list of how I want these things to be
- be sure all the statements feel good
- rate them at the end
- make revisions to the ones that can be better)
- as time passes, find new ways to say the same thing (to keep them fresh)

as we go through life we tend to see two aspects: good/bad, wanted/unwanted, good/evil -- we should instead teach our children to see it as quantity of one aspect: more good / less good, more wanted / less wanted, etc.

earth is 3
saturn is 6
jupiter is 8

can I find an expansive form with a hexagon, or octagon as the base?

in three dimensions, a "platonic solid" is not possible because:
- connected triangles is a tetrahedron
- connected squares is a cube
- connected pentagons is is a dodecahedron
- connected hexagons is a plane

(maybe then, if I extrapolate out to a higher dimension the same idea)

first though, I think it prudent to try and figure out what an expansive square base might look like. seems like it might be composed of squares and diamonds?
maybe you take a cube and you put it on its point and then open it up, so that the "bottom" is actually 4 squares coming together to make a point.

then, look for an expansive pentagon using the same technique

look for a planetary shape which can produce those effects?

smallest should be 1/2 of medium?
what about 3,4,5 relationship? (roots?)
I would like the two sides of the right angle to have a significant relationship w/ the 3 other sides
90 + 112.5 + 112.5 + 112.5 + 112.5 = 540?
