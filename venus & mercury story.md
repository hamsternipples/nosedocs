# the venus & mercury story

### intro

these ideas have been kind of rattling around in my head for a while. I don't really know how to present them, so I'm just going to start here. this is a made-up history of things which I have intuited. they are sort of a combination of the history provided by the sirian guide, kuthumi's guide and a bunch of other things I have picked up.

a funny thing happened: last night I began to read the emerald tablets, which has a kind of unbelievable intro to it... cept the intro (minus the unbelievable tablets story of translation from a vibrational atlantean language into a kind of weird ancient hybrid english -- why not just translate the tablets into the same normal english used by the author to write the prelude?) I don't really know what to think about them, and because they touch on a number of different things (and happen to align with) some of the things I had intuited, I wanted to get the first draft of this done before I continue on reading those tablets.

### the different phases of earth's evolution.

one of the most notable theories I had ever heard about the three different types of stonework that can be seen in peru was the theory that [lookup reference] a guy made about the earth being really close to the sun (in the first orbit) when the oldest stonework is to be seen (it looks like they take the rock, turn it into butter, then can make square "doors" or other maiuplations to the rock as if it were effortless to remove the rock underneith). something happens; there's a cataclysm, and earth moves to the next orbit (the second). in this stage, we see the polygonal stones fitted together found all over the world (for more info: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTd1fRCAvR4)).

there was another cataclysm, and earth moves to where it is today, in the third orbit.

according to kuthumi and the sirians, the "gods" lived among men in the first life wave. this corresponds quite well with the first orbit idea. there are lots of different stories about the gods living amongst humans on the planet at that time. the gods taught humankind different things about how vibrations work and stuff. the most notable among them is this thoth guy. he was in the first life wave, but we also know that he was a prominent figure in the second one as well.

genesis talks about this "fall" from the first orbit into the second as the "fall" of adam or the first major cataclysm. the second cataclysm is the deluge retold in genesis as the story of noah (clearly borrowed from other more ancient sources).

I have postulated that there must have been a reason why the earth moved from the first to the second orbit. the way I perceived it, and the tablets may challenge the idea, so this is why I'm writing this now. I believe that thoth/hermes/mercury actually made his transition into a planet that we now call mercury.

you see, people in those days believed that stellar bodies would incarnate into physical bodies and live amongst the men. if mercury were to have been created in our star, that means he found a way to, using the earth as a focal point, create a magnetic field on the surface of the sun such that large amounts of material would accumulate, enough to create a planet. in what would be a tremendously energetic event, the sun would have created a planet in a form similar to how a CME happens.

I don't know how many planets in this solar system are native to the solar system, but you could imagine the symbolism if you think about the sun god (father), and his one begotten son. that part is a bit weird to me, but I thought I would throw it out there.

it seems to me quite probable that the creation of mercury could have been the thing that pushed earth into the second orbital position. this was the old kingdom, or pre-dynastic era, which moses writes as the fall of adam from the garden of ease out to toil the earth relying more on the intellect. we are now further from the father provider sun.

in kuthumi's article it talks about how there was one 7th ray male that was damaged in the transition the universe made. before being rehabilitated by the creators, he taught a lot of entites to be worthless in their own eyes (yet at the same time believing their own illusion of superiority).. these were the INFECTED ONES. the article ceases to talk about this creator, but it seems that he no longer became a threat -- so probably he rehabilitated just fine. his mental disease continued to spread though, however they did not seem to respond to rehabilitation though, so eventually all of these INFECTED ONES were collected, tied vibrationally to this planet, and incarnated into physical bodies here (cause the women were so hot, na√Øve and innocent -- this is is likely the giants that showed up on earth and took women to be their wives).

I believe that thoth is most likely the original creator that was damaged in the transformation. as a result, he was put here on this planet to guide the planet through its evolution filled with these INFECTED ONES.

he was clearly so far ahead of everyone else on the planet, that the closest example I can give of this would be tesla. tesla was so far ahead of everyone else in his knowledge of electricity, that no one could really comprehend him. even to this day, he's still far beyond the understanding of vibration and electricity, than even the most knowledgeable, today.

it's a lonely world being that far out there. I understand myself what this is like. I try to explain something, and I'm so far ahead, that my words sond like gibberish or I'm completely skipping over important foundation ideas (which appear as obvious to me) such that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I can only imagine thoth's desparation here on this earth. the legends say he didn't die for the tens of thousands of years that he was here in the first phase. you can't imagine how frustrating it would be to not have anyone to talk to about your latest discoveries, no one who understnds you, or even sees things like you do (literally and metaphorically).

it was likely an upgrade to become a planet. it's pretty lonely being superior all by yourself. it may be fun if there's a group of you, but when it's just you, it's not very fun. thoth taught his knowledge to certain groups of people, but he was still FAAAR AHEAD of everyone else. though he's a planet, he took physical form and incarnated here apparently at the time of hermes, three times (thrice great)

### now, venus...

the next story, is the story of ra and sekmet, which I believe is a retelling of the story of venus (sekmet's) capture by the sun (ra). velikovski touches on this topic a lot and is the main focus of his book "worlds in collision".

in that book, velikovski postulates that the events recorded as the exodus were venus' interaction with earth. it appears that the egyptians had such a superiority complex that they couldn't allow fow the retelling of their slaves making a grand exit from egypt, so the story of ra and sekmet is all that remains in the egyptian narrative of the hebrews exodus.

I believe that the way that thoth performed his transition into the planet mercury was through the great pyramid. there was something in there that was an enormous producer of energy (the tablets say it was a crystal).

at that time, with the earth being closer to the sun (we're in the second position now), and with the pyramids pumping out tons of energy into the atmosphere, LOA is going to be much stronger. I think moses was a manifestation of the desire the semites had being enslaved by the egyptians. moses grew up in the pharoah's court, so he knew of the the mysteries and secrets involved with the creation of energy, it's magical effects (how it boosts LOA), and how that can be used to create reality (magic).

---

knowing of thoth's magical arts, and knowing that thoth had turned himself into a planet using whatever was inside of the great pyrmaid, and anguished that such an injustice could be happening to the semites, moses decided that he would use the same technology to create a new monotheistic god which would look after the semites in the same manner. this is how I think the exodus began.

combined with the strong desire that moses had over this injustice, his belief in a saviour, the comet venus began to ineract with earth. this planet venus is called YHVH by moses, and after various upgrades to the idea (started by elijah with the ministry of the prophets), the realisation of this saviour was beginning to take form (eg. venus wasn't what moses was really looking for).

the capture of venus again pushed the earth out to the third orbit, where it is today.

elijah established the ministry of the prophet, and the prophets began to shape the human incarnation that this planet would have. the realisation of this the figure that we refer to as jesus.

### mercury & venus

it seems to me that this is all leading to a marriage, or a unification of these two archetypes of venus and mercury. venus is a first ray female, and thoth is a 7th ray male. these are the "alpha and the omega" the beginning and the end.

I doubt this is literal, but it speaks to a future time for me when the earth becomes a sun (an idea originally from tesla) and venus and mercury are a part of that. however, in the present time, this is likely to manifest as the equalisation of the two sides, at the peak of the waveform. it's likely to be the manifestation of the height of the 7th ray masculine energy, and from then on it's back down to the 1st ray feminine.

### problems with my theory.

if I look at the different "cataclysms" that occurred, the fall of adam and eve was clearly 1st ray energy (a leaving of pure desire down toward more and more dense physicality). the next one was the deluge, which would have happened at the hight of atlantis. different mentions of the deluge, tend to refer to it as a "punishment" from god on the wicked people. I think that interpretation is not the best way to look at it. it may appear that way when you're not really understanding of LOA, but once you understand that you attract your reality, you realise that when atlantis, and the pyramids were functional and all this stuff, energy moved rapidly, and LOA was quite strong. it wasn't punishment. they had simply used physical aparatus to boost the energy to such a high level, that their own thoughts attracted the disaster. there was no punishment.

we're at about the same point now where energy levels are rising higher and higher, and we're entering into the height of 1st ray masculine energy again. there will likely be another event which causes the reversal of direction (that's what the peak means. the peak is when things are finally balanced and the energy reverses), and it'll come as a result of our own thought.

so, looking at the cataclysms again:

adam & eve: 1st ray (height of desire, reverses toward physicality)
deluge: 7th ray (height of pysical experession, reverses toward desire)
moses & the exodus: 1st ray (height of desire, reverses toward physicality)
???: this one I don't know. I can't figure out why whe haven't had another 7th ray one...
jesus: 1st ray (height of desire, reverses toward physicality)

seems, we're approaching another 7th ray. I do remember the sirians said we're going to see the 7th ray energy come back into effect, which hasn't been since the hight of atlantis (deluge). I would have guessed that it would oscillate back and fourth between the two, but it seems something has kind of intererrupted the oscellations. I don't really know.

the other problem with the thory I can't remember now. I'll add it when I remember it. it had to do with venus' capture timeline
