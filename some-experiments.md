title: experiments I would perform if I were nosebook
stage: 2
---

honestly, I don't think I would perform these experiments on my users (without their permission) if this were my network -- but, since experimentation and manipulation seem to be an ok thing to do here, I noticed my own curiosity begin to take shape. my first impulse would be to pose these sorts of questions to source energy, and get their thoughts on the subject, but why do that when you have a whole network of willing participants to work with, right? (kinda a little bit of sarcasm there, but kinda not really too -- I am genuinely curious) in each section I will also provide a hypothesis as to how I think I would respond to the experiment as well, and I invite nosebook to perform the experiments on me, and let's see what happens.

a lot of the inspiration for these experiments has been born out of my own life experience. however, my curiosity comes from the idea that these experiments can be run on children who do not have my life experience, and will therefore grow up thinking the experimental conditions are normal. with these contrived experimental conditions, will the experiments produce in these children similar conclusions in the subjects that my life experience produced in me? I think it's going to be a mixed bag of results, but in the grand scheme of things it may even be possible to see these experiments like a nosebook dojo: it may be possible to observe improved resilience and adaptation to these contrived conditions, therefore allowing humankind to (for the first time) begin influencing the new frontiers of adaptation for the human race.

## attempted prevention of someone's desire

take a sample of children that are not yet able to stand. for one group of kids, [shock them|make their body involuntarily convulse] so they fall down and are unsuccessful in their attempt to stand up. for the second group of kids, only shock them sometimes, and for the third kids only shock them when other people are around.

things I would be interested in finding out are:
 - for the kids being shocked 100% of the time, will they keep trying? they see people walking around all the time, so the desire should be there, but are they going to simply give up because some unknown force is preventing them from being unsuccessful.
 - is there a difference in tenacity between genders (eg. are boys more likely to give up quicker than girls)
 - for kids being shocked only when other people are around, will they try to stand up when no one is around. will this affect how "private" the child grows up to be.

hypothesis: [...]

## try to affect someone's belief system

since a belief is just a normal thought repeated enough times that it becomes reality for the thinker, nosebook should try and see if they can create a belief system for someone by inducing thoughts in their head. (also approval)

techniques: [...]

some thoughts: momentum - since someone's beliefs can't just turn on a dime, the injection of thoughts should be gradual [...]


## replace the emotional guidance system with a pleasure/discomfort guidance system

for our first set of kids, we will replace [...] and whenever they think a thought that produces a good feeling emotion, give positive (pleasureful) feedback to the thought. from now on, whenever the kid thinks the thought, give positive feedback. the goal here is to try and drown out happiness with pleasure, thereby addicting the child to the visceral feedback instead of emotion. (the same thing can be done with negative emotion too: whenever negative emotion is felt, send a visceral feeling of discomfort into the child's body to heighten the effect)

next, the experimenters (or child's parents) will go on picking various thoughts to which will be given positive (and negative) feedback. these should be the objectives the experimenters (or parents) want the child to accomplish.

>>> see if the kid gets addicted to the thought

#### background

when I used to smoke mdma, I used to wake up in the morning feeling absolutely incredible, however I was addicted to the visceral pleasureful feeling that the mdma provides, and thought I needed that to be able to be productive, so I immediately smoked one so I could get right into my programming. if I knew what I know now, I would have savoured that good feeling for as long as possible: go to take a walk, and enjoy the morning before trying to program. I hadn't realised yet that good feeling is what I am actually looking for. the pleasureful feeling made me feel better but it wasn't a solid creative foundation. anything worthwhile cannot be achieved in the time it takes to roll a joint or do a line.

the next major learning experience I had on this subject, was the dichotomy between the pleasure I would feel as girls would hold me as the object of their attention and my own emotion in response to the moment. the most memorable of these situations was when I was living in the pueblo. I had taken a bus back to valverde from madrid. the closer I got to the pueblo, the more "excited" I felt. at times it was such a strong feeling of desire and there was also mixed in a lot of feeling of celebration. I got the idea that I would go to the bar. I get to the bar and see pierre and pachi. my general emotional set-point was one of frustration and hopelessness because I had recently put together the pieces of the puzzle about people being able to see through my eyes and wanted very badly to use the technology to create a computer-to-brain interface. I was met with lots of opposition to the subject and I was so very aware of the absence of that desire. every day it was becoming more and more obvious that dream had had been smashed as well and would not be happening. also I had built up some expectation with andrea, and there too, I was very aware that she now feels quite a bit different than when I had initially made the expectations. I honestly believed that she would be able to learn how to translate source energy (cause she seemed to respond so well to LOA stuff) like esther does with abraham, this alse had become painfully obvious that it would no longer be happening. things feel pretty hopeless.

so here I am very aware of the absence of everything I had hoped for and pierre is trying to convince me to feel some other way which does not feel good to me. he finally says I should go to the house. I am feeling extreme hopelessness and rebellion that someone is trying to push me to do something I don't want to do, and yet at the same time I have a very visceral feeling of pleasure as I am sure someone was anticipating my arrival back home. I remember the moment so clearly because I had such strong negative emotion in contrast to the intense desire I was feeling at the same time. I told pierre that I did not want to go because I didn't feel good about it.

that got me thinking because I have come to trust my emotion and the way things feel are an accurate way for me to know what kind of reality would come next. it was very clear to me that was not my path of least resistance toward the things that I want. in the rear-view mirror now, I can clearly see how that might have been a very frustrating path to take. seeing that I was experiencing almost all of the worst negative emotion, I would have just dragged those problems forward and it would have been certain disaster for me. if I had of trusted that strong and very visceral externally generated pleasure over my soft subtle emotion, I would have found myself further still from what I was looking for.

[...] when she focused on me like that in such a positive way, I felt really really good. I notice I have a similar effect on others. when I focus on them in a positive way, they feel really good. when I felt good (and knew my own value), then my focus on other people, also made them feel good. most desire based people are like that, and she is a powerful transmitter of desire. [...]

((I really wanted to show her this early on, and I began making inroads to demonstrating this with the card game we played, but who knew that ))

#### caveats

it is possible that this experiment could produce kids that learn quickly not to trust sensations external to them over their own emotional guidance system, however I believe in the short term at least, this experiment is far more likely to condition the children to blindly follow the visceral (sensation) over the vibrational (emotion). if you think of nosebook as an extension of the facebook reaction machine, then having a lot of sensation oriented users may be of benefit to them and this experiment may play a bit into their hand -- however, I still think it's worth it: just for the prospect that even a handful of the kids arrive at the conclusion that they would prefer to trust and understand what their emotion is telling them.

I think that more than just a handful of kids will come out of this experiment successfully if their parents teach them the value of their emotions. you can follow the direction of your pleasure centres, and that will have lots of moments of feeling good, but it's a bumpier ride.

in a lot of ways, this can be illustrated by looking at the contrast between andrea and me. I chose to follow what my emotion is telling me and she chose a more visceral approach to things. if a parent is guiding their child with positive and negative feedback, the child following the parent's guidance will be more popular with the parents because the child is performing in such a way that the parents can feel good for a moment. however, if the child is following their emotion, then only sometimes the parents will be able to feel good about the child's behaviour. this inconsistent behaviour elicited by the child can make the parents feel like the child is out of their control. after all, if the child could just do these things that I want him or her to do them, then I can feel good about them. this is clearly a analogy of what has been happening with me. I simply have not been performing in such a way that makes my parents (nosebook) feel good. andrea probably has been, so she probably sees a lot more approval from nosebook and others that can get her to perform in a way which makes them feel good. however, in her perspective (which none of us can really know), I might venture a guess that the ride is a bit bumpier, trying to please so many different things.

---


I believe the thought will become a bit like a drug to the kid and will have a phase where he/she is (without really knowing what is happening) thinking that thought quite often to get that pleasure response.

usefulness: this behaviour is analogous to any pleasure seeking (addictive behaviour). I noticed it myself even in my relationship with raquel. if I do these things to illicit sex, then I will viscerally feel better. I later learned that viscerally feeling better by taking drugs or looking for sex did not make me emotionally feel better, and even though I knew of ways I could viscerally feel better, what I really want is to feel better because my perception has changed.

long term hypothesis: I believe the child will eventually gravitate away from thinking that pleasureful thought and more toward thoughts that really make him/her feel better emotionally/perceptually.

variations to try:
 - positive feedback on negative thought will produce in the long term higher proclivity toward those negative thoughts?
 - positive feedback on positive thought will produce in the long term lower proclivity toward those positive thoughts?
 - negative feedback on positive thought will produce in the long term lower proclivity toward those positive thoughts?
 - negative feedback on negative thought will produce in the long term lower proclivity toward those negative thoughts?
