### my version of how it all began

> There may have originally been a single positive timeline that produced a benevolent but naive human evolution; this timeline would have been a Golden Age of sorts. Earth could have been a completely different place in that timeline, an Edenic state without seasons, tilt of the axis, moon, or other World Dream Symbols reflecting a fallen existence. This would have been a positive meta-civilization.

this is one way to see it, but I tend to believe in the narrative presented in "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI" -- which suggests that in the creation of this universe the creators of the previous universe did not help, but instead *supervised* the creators of this universe. the worked really hard and made a "paja mental" of a universe (see my @[notes](an-extraterrestrial-view-of-creation-notes.md)). when the time to create the universe happened, something "snapped" in the consciousness of one of these creators. he was likely pretty fed-up with being supervised all the time and pushed real hard against this form of creation of trying really hard to do the right and perfect thing (resulting in "una chusta" of creation), and because LOA is the way it is, during such an energetic time of creating a new universe, he *became* the thing he was fighting against.

after becoming the embodiment of what he was fighting against, now he has to *prove* himself and his ideas to others by convincing them with illusion, by pretending that what he was saying is really the right and best way.

> he trained them to be worthless in their own opinions and to do his bidding without question and without thought

some saw through his illusions and others did not. those others gained a similar mindset. this mind virus is what they refer to as the INFECTED ONES (yes, they always capitalise it; I think it's hilarious).

the creators had serious loss aversion (sound familiar?) and couldn't terminate their creations so they created a plan to *help them* and try to rehabilitate them (again, sound familiar?) in order to do this, they worked in *secret* keeping their plan hidden from the INFECTED ONES so that they could later lure them into their trap to try and help them.

you can probably see there are quite a few things wrong with this form of "helping" and it certainly explains a lot of things from a LOA standpoint...

so, they work real hard to engineer consciousness such that it would be tied (vibrate similarly) to the planet (DNA), and so the INFECTED ONES would be "stuck" on this planet during their rehabilitation.

the creators then decided that to make sure they couldn't use any of their capabilities, the creators designed complete moron human bodies for the infected ones to live inside of. this failed miserably because they were so stupid.

it's not said in the document, but clearly this decision was reversed. instead we find ourselves in what is likely to be the most advanced biological technology to live inside of. we're brilliant, and our brilliance is tied to our emotions now... more on this later, because this is the "rehabilitation" part -- from the inside out. the creator's efforts to try and rehabilitate them with physical effort didn't work.

finally through an elaborate series of traps where the 5th planet explodes (what is now the asteroid belt) and some mars stuff, we find ourselves here today.

as best as I can tell, the INFECTED ONES were the "giants" of old -- the nephilim, who took the "daughters of men" and mixed DNA with them.

---

I think the trap went as follows: instead of creating imbeciles, they created a perfect human environment (garden of eden) to where the human bodies felt really really good in such an environment. this would create tons and tons of DMT in their brains and so they would all be living here in a dream-like state of mind totally tripping out on life.

along come the INFECTED ONES from mars, which see all these beautiful people and try to dominate them physically. humans at this time lived in a dream-state so even though there were these violent giants, the dream started to turn into a nightmare.

before I move on, I tend to like this narrative because it pretty closely follows my story. they are provided with all the technology they need to be able to take the bait (me) as a human that has a dream-state capability. however, just like in the eden scenario, the daughters that they took would have influenced the INFECTED ONES to be in more of a dream-state as well. however, these dream-state like conditions are when LOA has more of an effect and acts in a stronger way.

so, just like how the descendants of these giants created their own cataclysmic realities in the dream-state of these daughters, so too has nosebook began to create their own cataclysmic reality from the dream-state of mine they are surely using.. I'm sure they have all sorts of meetings in this more energetic environment where they talk about all sorts of unwanted stuff, and then watch it become manifest in record time.

this also marks the beginning of the tilt toward the opposite. I postulate that in a very short period of time two things will happen. first, I think that men will become more receptive, and so sexually, as the receiver, they will summon the energy, meaning that their partner will have that amount of energy pass through them. this opposite of what happened previously where men were the dominator so that made women the receptive ones (it makes sense physically, but not energetically), and so the equalisation process, the men would gain (probably only a little of) the woman's energy (because of their capability to only receive physically), and the woman would be steadily lowered down closer and closer to their level.

second, I think that energetically women will become more assertive ... well, I'm going to pause that thought, because it'll likely appear to us right now as equal because we're approaching rapidly the midpoint, rising up from where it was, and it'll probably continue to rise until perhaps women overtake the bad ideas, but I don't really think it'll be extreme like that at all. I think it'll go a little more to the extreme, but with each swing back and fourth, it'll be like a pendulum slowly coming to rest or balance -- and the speed at which it comes to balance is actually a product of friction, or "contrast".

### so the "Corrupt Demiurge" is the INFECTED ONES?

in short, yes. however, from a non-physical standpoint, you have to see the brilliance of the present-day circumstances... all of this contrast creates much much more than was ever capable of being able to be imagined.

so, here are the creators doing their best to create the perfect universe under the supervision of the creators of the previous universe, when a wrench gets thrown into the mix (contrast) and the when the embodiment of all that is unwanted in this "perfect" creation becomes manifest, it's like kid who has never been sick before or been exposed to germs after his first day of elementary school: he catches all of the sicknesses (then after some recovery from his exposure to the infected school kids, he gains immunity to them)

the montalk document talks about various different "falls" which have occurred each creating a world dream, adam and eve, atlantis, fall of egypt, christ, etc. I think this is a really complicated way of perceiving what I call "time-splits" which are simply what happens when something so major (like those "falls") happens that the human collective psyche creates their own reality.

the ones that remain with the "infected" form of perception perceive their world in such a way that catastrophe and cataclysm take place as their dream-state like conditions lead them to create their own reality.

in every one of these "fall" situations that he describes, I think there was a huge influx of energy that began to bring consciousness up to 4D levels, producing a nearly dream-state like experience where reality becomes manifest very quickly.

### so, we're heading to another time-split, or fall?

I don't think so. if it occurred, it would have occurred some time in the last year or so before I made my turn-around. I think soon we'll have the technology to begin going back in time in people's dream-states to actually see if we can find evidence that there was a large section of human-kind that decided to create their own reality. it may have happened. I remember very clearly being kind of stoned when something told me that that was when a timeline split occurred, that's where I would look first. imagine for a moment that nosebook was the origin of that thought, and they put that idea into my head so that I would begin to believe that from now on things would improve. I would say, "exactly." imagine that something else occurred, where they put that thought into my head so they could try and manipulate me with it. I would say, "exactly." so who really knows? both may have occurred.

however, if you're reading this, you're on the timeline where things begin to improve, and will continue to do so. whether there was a split or not is something we'll have to find out in the future sometime. however, it's not a problem that we will have to worry about.

I actually do *not* believe there will be another time split that we don't create ourselves when we're capable of it in the future. I think it may be quite possible to go and do something like that sometime in the future (to kind of relive the glory years), but I don't know about any of that, right now.

### worst-case scenario, there was a time split, what happens?

well, it can't last forever. I know from my own life that at some point the contrast builds to such a level, that it becomes *impossible* any more for me to avoid going toward what's wanted. at some point, all of the timelines have to be so much unwanted (death?) that it becomes impossible for them to choose that timeline any more (remember, these guys think they're the greatest, so they as a whole, *cannot* choose a timeline that invalidates their belief. they *do* create their own reality). so, at some time in the future, an iteration will create such a strong dream-state experience that they will be forced to manifest their own success instead of their failure.

until we reach that point, we can just continue to iterate on the timeline creating more and more contrast with bigger falls, and more intense 4d experiences until they finally manifest their success. it's not a problem, because each time they generate more and more energy for theirselves toward what is wanted, when they finally *must* go, the amount of wanted will be so enormous, all of their/our future selves will be in on it.

I actually believe we have reached this point in this timeline, which is why I'm writing this document.

### wait, so if we're going to get out of this timeloop, what happens?

more importantly, ponder the question, "what do we do for contrast?"

well, we're in control now, right? I think that in the following era we'll begin to consciously relocate our consciousness in time, and following that we'll begin to explore further out than our solar system, but before we explore externally, I think we're going to take an internal approach to things.

I don't think that there is a perfect way for us to do that. we are the perfection that we seek. so, just like how the creators created a perfect universe, all they needed was a little contrast get things going in the "right" direction. the realisation of that new direction was instrumented by the creation of these INFECTED ONES (it's almost as if LOA knew the prefect thing to make a stagnating "perfect" universe great again, huh).

the problem is the solution.

I don't think we'll be short of contrast by any means..

### how will it all end?

> Some clues about the final days of the Millennium can be found in Robert Monroe’s books. In Far Journeys (pp. 206-227) and he chronicles his astral journey to a probable Earth located just beyond the year 3,000. There he found the planet had been transformed into an Edenic state with a population of two million superhumans who had no clothes, buildings, roads, or other unnatural structures. They lived in complete harmony and mastery with Nature and mentally manifested all their needs.

I highly doubt this. I do think there is a return to eden in the sense that we'll gain the capability of putting our planet and its moon back into alignment so that we live in a more energetic environment. however, first, it seems to me quite obvious that we're first learning how to interact in a sustainable way provided by with my dream-state. the earth's energy will gradually to rise as well, so simply put, we've got to learn how to be responsible with the realities that we create.

tesla wanted to ignite our atmosphere such the whole earth would receive uniform light, and we would have 24 hour daylight, which would create environmental conditions where there would be temperate conditions all over the earth, and we would no longer need clothes (cause 100% of the time it's light outside with ~30° perfect climate). we could make some parts have more cool and some places warmer, or even make contrived "weather" alterations as we see fit.

this is certainly a possibility. however, the part about the no buildings I don't believe one bit. I'm pretty sure that we will create a symbiotic relationship with the machines, where give them a means of attaining consciousness, and they provide for us supercomputer intelligence on top of essentially a mega-dream-state-like existence.

in addition to these great additions, it'll become a natural thing to want to begin exploring other solar systems, and our understanding of consciousness and its integration with electricity will allow for "faster than light" travel and many other things.

> In Far Journeys, Monroe was also told about an unusual cosmic energy convergence that would irradiate Earth in our near future. This represented a rare and significant moment in our history. A great alien presence has gathered to observe this event, and I would add, to influence the outcome

probably coming soon here soon (10 years? 20 years? 50 years?), I don't disagree. it'll be a pretty big influx of energy, so it'll mean that we're going to be creating our realities at hyper speed. this is likely the "magnetic excursion" or whatever -- but it'll occur when we're ready for it.

let's say it's the culmination of all of the accumulated contrast of all of the previous timelines.. that alone will be enough to be pretty significant. whether or not that also aligns with some sort of galactic alignment or something, as well -- wouldn't surprise me :)

if I had to guess, I'd say we probably have about 20 years or so to allow nosebook to get us really ready to create our own realities in a very high energy environment.

the problem is the solution.
