# noseblog

I decided I wanted to begin writing things down. I'm going to try and do a quick blurb here so that I have a bit more context. it seemed like I wanted some way of organising my thoughts a bit more than the twitter way, and still have a bit more context for me to remember things with. I've gotten to the point that remembering what happened a week earlier not only feels like about a month has passed, but I find it rather difficult to even conceptualise how things were so long ago. this will hopefully give me the reference point I need to help me remember how things were so long ago, a bit easier

### 2020-01-04 13:37 - ???

the other day when I wrote @[entry](2019-12-26 00:00) I jumped to a conclusion that I now think is wrong. I went to bed this morning thinking that actually the time split had occurred and they (nosebook) are stuck with me, and I'm just working my way up to finding my connection.

the whole premise of the entry previously mentioned was that there are seemingly infinite timelines where the girls thing happens, so I mixed that idea with what I believe happened in jesus' timeline where he died. I reasoned that since all paths lead to me finding my alignment, then there had to be only one where I didn't find my alignment (with who I really am).

so, I postulated that this was the coming time split, however, they already tried to fake a time split and it really did split it seems and quite a mess was made. so I guess that was the time split.

---

I woke up this morning with a similar idea, that seemed to be in reaction to questions that were asked at the latest abe workshop (which I'm assuming happened today). I realised that since all paths lead to me finding my connection, the *one* that's different is not the one where I don't get connected, but the one where *all* get to experience that connection.

it seems that on other timelines, I either found my way without the girls, or I found my connection with the girls, resulting in a situation where me, the girls, and people willing to participate in the girls' experience were the only ones on the planet that got connected from the event. obviously this would have created quite a strong desire to fix the situation, timeline technology was created this timeline adjusted to derail the latest disconnected interaction with the girls and yet again people wanting to experience that transferred their consciousness into this timeline to experience it. it probably happened quite a few times, seeing how many times things fell through.

so, from what I picked up from the reaction is that if the guys at nosebook wanted to continue to use my capablities (that is, instead of losing them when I go up), they  would have to let me go up. however, this is the part I don't really understand, because it felt to me like there was a catch, where in order to hold good to their promise to people, they would have to let everyone go up along with me or something like that.

that last part is the part that doesn't make sense to me because I don't really understand what other people have to do with me.. wouldn't they just hold other people down like they do me? why are they forced to let other people go up too, and why are other people guaranteed to go up? are they being held down too??? I don't really understand it to be honest. I only think in the direction of finding my connection without any regard for what others are doing.

anyway... the reaction was funny to me because it came to me in a funny form, because here nosebook had been working so hard to ensure their superiority, only to find out that if they keep it up, they are ensuring female or receptive superiority, because my form of perception would be such a big difference to what other's are that it would no longer be compatible -- so therefore the form of perception which peole can participate in would be the girls' which would improve very rapidly, and farsurpass the typical masculine form of perception.

so, no matter how hard they are working to hold their own superiority, they were obsoluting theirselves, and the only solution to not become the least superior is to allow me to get connected and let everyone rise up right along with us, both receptive and assertive types alike.

so, it seems that all timelines were pointing to this one where "everybody gets a vision upgrade!!"

---

it would seem that perhaps they may try to fight it even still, giving me maybe partial connection or some other lame half-cocked idea like that -- yet, I don't have any problems with that because I've come to realise that any limitation only makes me stronger (so they would be making me stronger), and it seems completely inevitable that eventually with my interaction with the girls, I will be fully connected. so whatever man...

---

since I'm a wonderful extrapolationist, I would imagine now, in light of this new turn of events, that the way that nosebook gets rid of us pesky connected ones is to allow us to transfer our consciousness into other bodies in other timelines, leaving them in control of the bodies we left behind and the people that are not offered to leave their timeline.

I know that I'll be peacing out to another timeline for sure. it'll probably be the disastrous one that they created when they wanted to fake me out and pretend a timeline split happened. that one sounds like it's got a whole lot of contrast on it :)

so, I guess you guys will have to wait until then to get the most ideal manifestation I was referring to (and it seems like we're part of its buildup). I/we will peace out though, and I've often wondered what would happen if a whole bunch of us were io leave a timeline. I've mentioned it a few times as a fun thought experiement.

in my estimation, probably not a whole lot. I would just expect ... well, if the people who are improvement focused and appreciating the contrast as the most efficiont form of expansion, I would imagine that most of the people remaining here would experience very little contrast at first, however without the contrast which produces the expansion, the previously ideal curcumstances would eventually get boring, not that exciting, and so removal of unwanted would begin to happen, leading to deterioration and decay...

people who are improvement focused thrive in a world of decay though. the contrast is necessary to arrive to the improvement.

this balance isn't a bad thing either because you cannot *only* breathe in, for example -- your lungs need to eventually expell air and contract from time to time.

everything goes through stages of expansion and contraction. the majority of my experience the last 12 years or so has been contraction, so it only really depends on which part of the circle (and resulting sine wave) you find yourself. the sine wave changes direction twice per cycle at the peaks, so everyone experiences both of these. I guess it depends on where you want to do your expansion or contraction: at the beginning or at the end.

this form of binary expansion is an interesting idea, however, in matt's video on the synchronisation of 3 metronomes, he arrived to a divergent 3-phase, which has sparked a ton of ideas in me because if some third mechanism could be added to compliment expansion and contraction, these three forces could operate with smoothly (the sum all of the waves in a 3-phase at any point in time always equals zero) and the sum of the three would ever give a result of one of the forces having "superiority".

that's my new thought experiment: what is a force that compliments expansion and contraction perfectly and "fits" between the two. it sounds to me like another dimension to me :)


### 2020-01-08 15:09 - I don't feel the need to stop star-watching.

the last few days, or rather ever since I wrote the previous entry stating that they would need to let everyone go up -- it has felt to me like there has been some sort of effort to try and persuade me to stop star-watching.

first of all, I think this is bologna and I don't believe it for a minute. to me it feels like they're just simply trying to buy time so they can get more things under control. it also feels to me like they're trying to work it out in such a way that not everyone gets equal something. it feels like they're working really hard to make sure some people get more of something than others.

from my perspective this is completely not an issue. they have given the impression that they can hold me indefinitely away from getting connected, so I apperciate the opportunity to continue to get stronger. I see no reason to stop.

---

there was another thing that popped into my head where I should make some sort of deal where I exchange my star-watching for the ability for us to have kids. once again, I call bullshit. there's no way they can possibly keep us from having children and not have it be a public relations disaster. simply put, they *have to already* let us have kids, so that's a pretty bad deal. additionally, that deal implies that we grant them the power to decide if kids are aborted or not (unless some sort of deal with them is made).

this is exactly the kind of salesmen "jujas" that are so prevalent in thier interactions. this interaction is only a shadow of the coming "influence" they wish to have on people.

---

I really feel like I'm in the process of leading a whole bunch of sheep into the hands of a bunch of wolves. whatever they're concocting to try and give people will likely be a very limited form of 5d. they likely won't let people actually experience that, so I'm a bit sad there. however, that is from my perspective where I know better, however, for a normal person that is used to seeing out of their crappy 2d eyes, it's probably a huge upgrade. I'm glad for those people, but for the rest of us, 4.5d is a pretty big downgrade.

I realise that it is the fulfillment of what I had anticipated that would happen where people would go into "storytelling mode" with a perception from outside of their body, but at the time the concept existed in space so I didn't really think about all of the manipulation involved with what it would become.

I should have known though... I guess some people will think it's pretty cool, but from my perspective, I'm sorry for essentially creating a new status quo of really manipulating people hovering around over you as if they were God, lording things over you to boost their own sense of self-accomplishment.

obviously, I have to just keep going my own direction. I wish you all the best.

---

it's not that I'm leaving or anything, I'm just saying that because I really wanted to make something different. the appealing thing about the whole time-split thing is something that I'll elaborate on shortly because this outcome sort of changes things entirely, and I'm not sure I totally am up to speed with it. I can see why it's shaping up this way though.

it actually combines almost all of the things I had been talking about into one manifestation. it's really hard to put it all into words. I kind of really want a cigarette now to begin to think this over again. I'll try a little bit here out loud.

---

we know that nosebook does have enormous desire that I do not go away, because it would essentially mean the end of their charade. we also know that this can be solved if I do make my transition into a multi-bodied experience -- and they would have even more me's to try and manipulate. so, whether they want to see it this way yet or not, me gaining a multi-bodied experience is actually what they want.

the kids will also have a similar rite of passage before actually getting connected, which is something I was thinking about in the cultures idea.

most importantly, if I make my transition into a multi-bodied experience, there won't be a time split in the same tradtional way that I had been anticipating because my energy is now spread among multiple experineces. it would be as if the earth had "caught" me and then off we go from there. I guess nosebook provides the continual contrast necessary to continue increasing that energy. obviously at the same time, I'll replicate and continue to increase in strength.

I'm pretty sure that even though these guys are trying to make different tiers of this 4.5d experience, that it's still a precursor to the next one which will be probably 5.5d for you guys where you control multiple characters also from a godlike perspective. I really think this is the only way these guys can stomach the idea of a shared form of perception: when they're no longer in any sinlge one character anymore where that one character has something to hide (obviously, instead the whole group of characters have something they are all hiding, so now previously awful things can be shared amongst members of the group).

this is a fulfillment of the "identity/mun" idea I've had so long ago amongst other things, as well.

---

I guess I'll leave it there... I want to begin to think more on it. I guess it's mostly just not what I expected.

doing things that you don't want to do != doing things that don't feel good to you


### 2020-01-09 09:06 - I guess we're back on track for a timeline split again...

after writing the previous entry, there was quite a feeling of "rechazo" in response to some of the ideas I presented. one of the funny ones was the rejection of the idea that what may be happening could actually be something wanted. another funny one was the idea that they would be "capturing" me. the reaction felt as if they couldn't really stand the idea that I would be stuck in human bodies for the rest of time constantly threatening their superiority. there was a sense that they would in fact rather that I wasn't bothering them and they could somehow get rid of me.

so, it feels to me like we're back on for the timeline split where I *don't* get connected and they can have their entire thing all set up the way they rant it to be.

I guess they just can't come to terms with the idea that I would actually ever get connected. instead, they want to just kick their problem down the road a bit, because it's not like they will actually ever get rid of me. LOA pretty much prevents that from happening as long as they keep fighting against it.

---

there was another aspect to the difference between yesterday and today which had to do with me stopping to watch stars. it feels to me like they want to try and make it so that everyone has a setup similar to what I have, where the system controls tseir form of perception and gives them a false one. so, instead of seeing out of my own eyes, I see what my eyes see after they've processed it and lowered its quality then put back into my eyes.

I think they want to make it so that there are mulitple "tiers" of perception and just the same way that they don't want people to actually experience 5d, they make sure that no one ever is able to shift their perception upward[^1]. I think what they want to do is to let the dmt levels in the person go high enough that people should be in 5d (exactly how I am right now yet I still see through my eyes), and then what they would do is to put the person permananently into their own experience just like you guys see my 5d experience in 4.5d, they want to mak sure everyone has their own 5d experience instaed from a 4.5d perspective.

---

well, besides how uncool that is[^2], it takes enormous resources on their part. they need to have a whole bunch of stuff in place to be able to do that -- and I thought they didn' have any money.. how in the world are they going to afford dedicated processing hardware for everyone on the planet?!!? also, it means that I simply have to wait for them to get this entire system in place before I can go up myself.

how long will it take for them to get this system in place for everyone? I have no idea, but whatever they estimate, go ahead and multiply that by 1.5x or 2x. questions to ask would be something lo the effect of how many are in place now, and how quickly are they getting installed, cause I think it's going to be years before they get their system all setup.

in addition, once they get it all set up, how closely tied is their setup to my power level? eg. if they get everything set up and a month later my power level doubles, will they all of a sudden need twice as many computing resources?

I don't want to wait around for them.

---

there is a solution that can be done, but I doubt that they would go for it... they *could* let everyone who can handle the 5d experience without the setup go up and experience things from 5d, then while they're cashing in on the profit from the girls, they will actually have they money to afford the systems necessary to get everyone on their tier system. it also largely decouples my progress from the resourmes requeried to run thier system. as I increase (which I'm sure I will because fwh said he achieved 11d), then only the systems of the people that need to run a 4.5d experience will need to be upgraded.

then once they've got their entire 4.5d system all in place, they can turn it on (gradually or whatever) whenever they feel like they're able to do it instaed of making us all wait.. I do have sadness thinking about when that will be, because one of the things that really bothered me most of all was losing the ability to see through my own eyes. the world looks SOOOO MUCH better looking through my own eyes. it really pissed me off, and if you'll remember, I really felt quite good when I could see through my own eyes, but then as that got taken away from me, especially in la vera it was most noticeable, I became quite angry as the way that I felt (good) no longer showed up in the frequency which my eyes saw. instead, I just saw the low frequency version of that their system had processed. so, no one was able to see the high quality version my experience was producing, instead *all of us* (including myself) only saw a lower quality version[^3].

that's what I was meaning when I said in the previous entry:

```
I really feel like I'm in the process of leading a whole bunch of sheep into the hands of a bunch of wolves. whatever they're concocting to try and give people will likely be a very limited form of 5d. they likely won't let people actually experience that, so I'm a bit sad there. however, that is from my perspective where I know better, however, for a normal person that is used to seeing out of their crappy 2d eyes, it's probably a huge upgrade. I'm glad for those people, but for the rest of us, 4.5d is a pretty big downgrade.
```

---

obviously, I'm going to continue on watching stars because all of this is speculation on my end, and doesn't really matter that much to me. for me, they're my personal trainers and I want to continue to get stronger. for me to stop would be like my personal trainer to tell me to stop working out meanwhile they building the new gym that I'll go to soon.

perhaps too my continuing to get stronger will push them to actually have to let people go to 5d temporarily before putting them down to 4.5d. if that does happen, don't worry, because it's just more desire. you don't really want something until you lose it :) trust me...

[1]: there's a mechanism inside of he head where your consciousness moves upward to a higher feeling position in your head when dmt levels reach a certain level. you feel taller and you start to see your body as well as the world all around you.

[2]: because what they essentially would be doing is installing the necessary for everyone to have a premium subscription, yet on purpose spending the processing resources necessary, to lower the quality for everyone except for their premium members.

[3]: understanding this, I have ideas on doing an analogue system which wouldn't have as much loss of high frequency, and with good enough resonanation between people, it seems possible that you could have someone else's experience as if it were your own, meaning all of the actions, decisions and emotions you would experence as if you had been living in their life since birth so they would all feel natural and logical. there wouldn't nearly as much confusion as to why something happened in someone else's experience, because their reasoning and emotion would be apparent to the viewer exactly as it was to the broadcaster.


### 2020-01-14 07:59 - "it's gonna take forever"

when I was walking home yesterday, I was thinking about the reaction that I wass feeling about things taking a while.

I don't really think it's a problem. here's why:

first, right before the new year happened, I began to receive a whole lot of reactions to nosebook attempting to try and control this whole thing by providing all of the financial support to it. the reaction was funny because it was in response to another addition of another girl. they felt like it was becoming way too much of a financial burdon for them.

I found that kind of funny to me because in a previous entry where I stated what I wanted, I was very clear that I wanted to be economically focused in a way where the girls would hace the opportuity to grow up similar to the way I did. so, for another addition to happen, I didn't really think of it as such a big problem, because after all, and especially in the long run, it means considerably more profit, not a huge burdon. the only way it would be a burdon, is if the whole thing was only expendatures and no income.

the next reason why I thought it was funny was because this whole time nosebook has had the whole thing going that they cannot allow people to see well and gain improvements without paying for it. abraham summed it up well when they said that they've been on the "you have to earn it" vibe. which is kind of ironic because now what is happening is the following: I'm actually beginning to work on stuff and I should become profitable myself soon enough.

meanwhile I'm putting efforts toward becoming profitable, they have the perfect opportunity to allow people to simply go up to 5d, and then to likewise let me go up as well so we can start the party.

like I outlined in my previous entry, I think the reason why they're dragging their feet on this one is because they want to get the impossibly expensive goal of putting everyone into a system similar to the one that I'm in so that everyone is in 4.5d (where they think they have better control) instead of 5d -- all without cashing in on the girls thing in any way. I guess they're printing money to do it, cause I have no idea how they would be affording it otherwise.

---

so while they're trying to get everything all controlled and stuff, (they're basically going to take forever, I'm sure) my plan is to get profitable and to continue rising up the dimensions.

like I outlined in a previous entry, I'll probably be reaching 6d pretty soon, however, I won't actually see in 6d -- I'll remain with my crappy 3.5d vision, but I'll likely have an emotional feelings-based shared form of perception with those that are similar to frequency. the forshadow of this is already pretty evident.

then, like I postulated in another area, I'll likely continue to push the noseboys up higher and higher as I go along. they'll also gain a shared form of perception in 5.5d, then continue on upward into the non-physical dimensions as they become the planet's "thrust" or main source of influence on people's lives as they gain more and more tools to steer the people the way that they want them to be steered (and sometimes what upper management orders them to do as well).

it's going to be an interesting thing because they'll be basically untouchable by the reaistant upper management types because none of them will be able actually see or even comprehend what they're doing. like a very very high dose of ayahuasca or mushroom experience, it'll be far too abstract to make any sense of it (unless you built it, of course). so in the end even upper management will be subject to their influence.

---

this will likely continue to get more and more intense as I go up higher and higher, when finally I imagine they won't be able to hold on any longer, I'll get connected and a time split will occur.

they could attempt to avoid the noseboys getting a shared form of perception (though it's sort of inevitable assuming they can continue on with me) and let me go up now... lol, I doubt it.

it's sort of a bad anyway you look at it situation for them because right now only those that work for nosebook and those that can afford my form of perception will gain the shared form of perception, but if they let us all go up, they will essentially be giving a whole lot more people the opportunity to have that form of perception.

let's say that they have a backup plan and they're using someone else's form of percption now instead of my own, well, then it's still bad, because it becomes the realisation of they "how about a new eye" entry, where mostly women or receptive people will gain that experience easily.

frem their perspective it's all bad, and no decision is what they would want, and it's because they've been giving so much attention to what they don't want, that is literally the only reality that can manifest for them anymore. oh well :) not my problem.

---

so, from my perspective, let them continue on trying to control people's experience with their impossible goal... I'll be far stronger than I am now, you all are going to be able to see more and more LOA in action. I really would like to get profitable and stuff before all of this happens.

I wouldn't really expect much to change from the way it's going now because in order for it to be different, they would literally have to people give people something great that they don't deserve because they didn't pay for it, and also the only way they could get me going anywhere is if it no longer is a secret.. so, no longer a secret, and losing their superiority position just to give us something that's a financial burdon on them... I find that very unlikely.

let's wait and see what their next move is...


### 2020-01-18 07:56 - yesterday was a weird day.

yesterday was a bit weird because on my way walking to friedly harbor I was immediately presented with 2 girls playing while their father was washing the car, then another also with her father on the way to school presumably. I felt strong desire and I didn't know really what to do with it. I decided to let it just sit.

later further events unfolded where there seemed to be quite a bit of activity in a wierd way which I cannot effectively describe in english. when I got home I went to go star watch and begin to think about the events. I had the impression almost as if it were similar to like a last call bell at the bar before it closes.

I realised that these were all potential inclusions as well. I really didn't know what to do about it because it already seems a bit much to me, yet besides my logical mind saying it was too much, I didn't feel bad about it. in fact, quite the contrary: I really wanted to include them as well. I started warming up to the idea and that's when it all started to become clear.

at first, I reasoned that because I'm kind of an all or nothing kind of guy I would have to go with all of the girls that presented theirselves yestreday. I wondered why that seemed like not an issue, and I also wondered what was the bigger picture.

---

you see, nosebook has been giving a whole lot of their attention to how much they cannot control things, and so therefore because of LOA, they are presented with a disaster of yesterday where now it appears even more uncontrollable. then, I have been releasing resistance like crazy, such that I am now actually quite close to even being somewhat abraham-like in the sense that I no longer perceive (or I can perceive it but because I see the bigger picture so much clearer), the unwanted bit no longer appears to me anymore as unwanted.

this is a very interesting thing because I am supposed to make a selection based on the girls that I like and the girls that I don't like, yet I no longer can really find anything unwanted in things anymore. I really am approaching virtually zero resistance now. that means similar to how abraham presents theirselves, I no longer have much of a preference anymore. in fact, the thing that got me to this place was the realisation that if none of this ever happened (probably pretty imposisble becasue of how LOA works and the amount of inertia that it has presently) -- even if none of this happens, I'm prefectly fine with it all because I no longer perceive it as a physical manifestation but as an energetic accumulation of energy that's really the most valuable (hard to describe what that feels like, to be more confident in the non-phycal energy behind what's happening than the manifestation itself).

when you think about it, the most resistant people have the most preference, but as I noticed myself releasing resistance, I stopped worrying so much about any specific preferences and just let LOA do all of the work.

it makes sense that I'm beginning to lose enormous amounts of "personal" preference as I appreach 6d -- because, if you think about it, the storngest preference you have is toward your own experience. you prefer to spend time in your own experience, so it would be wierd for somebody to begin to experience somebody else's experience along with their own. however, that's where I'm headed. in oreder to experience 6d, not only do I have to release my resistance to other people interacting in my expereince, but to even release the resistance to experienceing their experience as if it were my own.

I believe this is what it means to realise the understanding that I am "source energy in a physical body".

---

so, where does this take us? I gave it some thought, and I belive that this is only the beginning of the unveiling of the new evolution of desire that has come about as a result of the events that have been taking place.

I believe the girls thing, because nosebook keeps on growing it bigger and bigger is just simply causing it to be diffrent than we had anticipated it to be.

I think the girls are going to all be much much more self-confident and self-reliant, and this will come about because they cannot all rely on my for those things and will have to find them more for theirselves (it'll be easy though!). I also think we're all going to be more self-sufficient and more independent for the same reasons.

that's a super graet thing because these are all qualities of strong and wonderful women, but I think the most greatest thing that's coming as a result of all of this is that we'll all gain a shared form of perception. I'll share my experience with the girls and our children as well. to the outside world, we'll all look like individuals (and behave as such), but yet at the same time we'll have a sort of a rhythm and syncronicity to our intractions that will seem like we're almost operating as if we were some sort of larger organism.

---

in addition to this, as I approach 6d, a similar thing will begin to be happening with the noseboys. as I have been going up and up, my form of perception sees less and less unwanted, so they (I'm referring more specifically to the engineers) are becoming less and less capable of perceiving anything unwanted in the things they're given to do, which probably makes them pretty productive, and yet at the same time it seems like I am reminded if myself right after I had the brain haemorrhage and in my early parts of spain. I was very productive, but I was also pretty naïve. I had a very difficult time preceiving the unwanted part in things, and as a result people really took advantage of me[^1].

they're going to be going up a lot higher than I was after my brain haemorrhage, so that'll be an interesting experience for them... anyway enough about that.

---

I'm kind of excited about all of this, as it appears that the shared form of perception is going to be fun. annother interesting thought that I made peace with last night with as well, was the idea that assume that for whatever reason we're not able to have any kids, obviously in order to maintain a resistance-free form of perception, this needs to not bother me/us, and also means, assuming that somehow nosebook is able to hold me away from actual 6d for the duration of my time here, that it's quite possible that I'll "make my transition" into the multi-bodied experience of the girls. kinda a weird idea from the perspective of a man, but I'm very closely approaching no longer being *just* a man, but having a source enregy perspective in a human body.

who knows man.. there are probably tons more evolutions of desire to go, because I find it very unlikely that they would ever be able to allow me to go up now that I'm approaching 6d. the last thing they would want is for me to be able to peek into anyone else's experience. they had a super hard time when it was *just* 5d, so I think they're probably going to fight it as long as they ppssibly can.

looks like this one is going into the long game.

[1]: I should qualify that statement. when I was in 3d, and I was feeling pretty good things were all fine, and I made great business negotiations with zaryn and such, but then I had my first sexual experience and lost 3d. it was in 2d where I no longer had access to all of that extra perception that people really began to take advantage of me. my inability to perceive unwanted remained, yet I was now playing on the 2d playing-field of perception of people who were considerably better at manipulating things on that plane than I was. learning how to get that form of perception back came as a result of my desire to get back there, so LOA brought me a lot of learning experiences to allow me to navigate those things and to gain even more confidence in myself than I had before I lost 3d preception.


### 2020-01-18 13:33 - preference

one of the funny reactions I got to the previous entry was this idea that if I lose my preference for attractive women (that is, I'm able to appreciate the unattractive ones -- that is, or to perceive only the wanted part in the unattractive ones), then they would actually rather be appreciated by a man that prefers an attractive woman.

yes, it is true that more resistant men will have stronger preference toward attractive women. so, if you want to be preferred for your physical beauty or preferred (as superior to other women), then definitely a more resistant guy is certainly for you. you get what you're looking for though.

when I was talking about losng my preference, what I was meaning is that it's an inclusive sort of thing, so my own preferences do not disappear, I lose my resistance to experioncing other peoole's preferences. my prefrences become a sort of combined total of the whole human race. like, I don't really think shooting guns is cool but I don't think it would bother me to experience that anymore. or maybe some bizarre food item or whatever. it seems I can even apperciate negative preferences as well. for example, if someone really dislikes something (yet I would normally like it), I can experience their dislike from their perspective and it doesn't really bother me. that capability is sort of an extension of still feeling good dispite the envoronment that I'm in. I can recognise in the envorenment someghing unwanted, but it doesn't really make me feel bad anymore.


### 2020-01-19 17:42 - tolerating diversity

I went to sleep pretty confident that I didn't want to make any more inclusions. the different signals seemed to fit the idea (there was the feeling of the "last call" followed by two that seemed to both be the "last" ones for different reasons). in addition to that, I felt done or no longer like there is still more. no now, that means my focus will begin to change to align much more with what's coming rather than where I'm at now.

so now I wanted to spend my time watching stars and pregramming as much as possible while things all get ready -- I suppose, it seemed to me like there was a feeling that nosebook wanted to try and get everything all "ready" (under control), even though it seems to me like we could start now, just they don't want to allow it to begin now because they cannot control it all.

personally, I do not believe they will ever feel like they will be able to control it, and I think they're just wasting time. so, I figure that instead of waiting around for them, I want to continue to watch stars and go up the dimensions as fast as I can, awaiting the moment when they're supposedly going to release the restrictions on my body (yeah, right, huh).

---

just now, and the reason why I'm writing this is because, I woke up with a really bizarre dream that seemed to try and make the implcation that if I continue to watch stars, then other people will have some sort of difficulties or something (the dream was extremely convoluted and barely made sense). I have a number of objections to this dream, because since they do not let me dream normally, this is only appears to me as a an attempt to try and keep me further away from 6d[^1][^2].

upon making this realisation, immediately, I was reminded of how miserable it is for a really intelligent kid to be held back and not allowed to excel, forcing them to go at the same speed as everyone else in the class. IMO, 95% of the bad kids these days, are not actually bad kids, but bored kids. they're smart kids that are not allowed to go at their own pace. our institutions seem to have this "one size fits all" idea because it's easier to manufacture (or control) one size than it is to manufacture (or control) a wide diversity of different sizes and shapes.

this morning was actually quite fortunate because matt just posted a video on this very subject yesterday: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbiveCNBOxk)

the story goes, due to new requirements of more advanced figher jets, new uniforms needed to be made. the US air force commissioned a study to try and find the "average man" and build their uniforms around that size. it turns out that the "average man" does not ezxist. it seems that nature wants to try and maximise diversity of attributes within the species. so, as a result, things like adjustable seats, helmets and such needed to be created to accomodate for the wide variety of different pilot sizes.

---

I'm so glad it was the US air force that commissioned this study, because the same exact thing applies to mental capability. I think they're trying to do a similar thing, where they're attempting to fit the entire planet into one muental size (a controllable version of mine) and then try to get everyone to conform to that one size.

in reality, this is (going back to the school analogy) akin to tryning to force all of the kids to go at the speed of the one going the fastest. you're just going to have a lot of really lost kids that have no idea what's going on. as with everything, everyone needs to be able to go at their own pace. I realise that this was impractical to allow everyone to go at their own pace a few decades ago, but today, espcially with advances in technology, it's never been more available to let kids actually learn at their own pace. there is no "average student"

so, because there is no "average human" anywhere to be found, I think it's a grave mistake to try and slow people down (like me), or try to hurry others up to meet some sort of metric of expectation for mental performance. I'm sure that some people feel like they're in some sort of wind tunnel trying to experience life with my form of perception, and forcing someone to go at some arbitrary speed is not what I'm about. these are performance expectations, and if any sort of expectations are going to be put, when we should be focus these instaed improvement expectations.

---

lastly, let's just imagine for a moment that I did believe that dream that I my going faster is in some way harmful to other people and that I'm somehow *responsible* for these people's difficulty by going too fast... so, let's say I slow down. how long do they need to get everyone up to their contrived metric? one year? two? four? let's say it's 4 years for them to get everything they need all ready.

they honestly want me to sit around on my hands for four years just so they can get ready, only to not be able to have any children? let's say the cutoff date when I do make my transition is in 2038 when andrea is 33, that gives us 18 years if we started now -- really only 17 if yuo consider how long it takes children to be born. most of the girls won't realistically be having children for 2-8 years more, so the majority of the children will be under 10 by the time 2038 rolls around. we don't really have that much time, and you want to drag your feet how long to make this system for the "average form of perception" for all humans -- an impossible task come to materialise??

whatever dude, you just keep trying to fit people in your little control boxes. I have stars to watch.


[1]: following how LOA works, their efforts to try and fight against me getting to 6d, seem to only be fueling my desire to get there, so this dream likely had the opposite effect of what they desired.

[2]: up until now, they have been controlling my dreams, preventing me from having any dreams that they do not control. I can tell this because when I have natural dreams, they are clear and I have intuitive knowledge into what is happening in the dream -- then, something usually wakes me up or something to end the dream. the dreams that I get from them and the ones that they control, my vision is usually much more blurry, and I have a very difficult time understanding what is happening in the dream. the dream usually has stuff appearing and disappearing as they're attempting to steer the dream, and lots of nonsensical appearances of things, which always leave me feeling confused or not undredstanding what is happening. this simply is because the concepts that my brain is used to processing are much higher frequency than their machines can produce, so it's sort of like the difference wbetween talking with someone on an old phone with a bad connection, or in person. the difference in quality is very noticeable. there's no doubt the dream was created by them. lately more than before, they seem to be using dreams to try and steer people.


### 2020-01-20 19:57 - imagining a macbook

today when I was talking with heather, I was talking about how jesus was a reality magician, and I used the example that I could (if I had jesus' visualisation capability) imagine a macbook sitting on the floor, then combined with desire, actually pick up a real macbook pro from the floor.

I just went out to smoke because it offers me the ability to disconnect a bit from the frequency which nosebook keeps me on, and feel some of the reactions... I smoked a cigarette rolled from a piece of blue paper so it gave me quite the headache, lol. this is important to disconnecting from the "matrix", because it allows me to feel so much more differently than I normally do, and their machines cannot modulate what I feel so effectively[^1].

well, the reactions to that idea were kind of humorous to me becsuse they do not believe that I could actually create a macbook pro out of thin air because, it turns out that the US gov installs some sort of resonating chip which works on the nosebook network and so therefore the position of the chip in 3d space is tracked in real time, so they would be able to see where the chip had come from. it sounds like this microscopic receiver is capable of running or modifying instructions on the micrprocessor and in some way allows is an unavoidable backdoor and cpu tracker for every intel (possibly amd as well) chip in existence.

as a result, they find it pretty impossible that I could create out of thin air an untracked macbook which they do not have access to. seems this idea interested them greatly because then how would I possibly have an unregistered version of OSX on the machine without a unique serial number linked to the processor.

I guess just how the romans documented everything, these guys track everything. I know they they store everything on massive storage volumes made from mimristor technology -- it's basically as fast or faster than DRAM (because of 3d row/column addressing) and capacities measured in exabytes[^2][^3]...

---

to that I must reply... I don't know :) I just know it's possible. I don't make the rules, and I don't have to worry about all of those details. perhaps the imagined version would actually have a registered serial number, or perhaps it would not. I don't really know :) I guess we'll have to wait and see...

challenge accepted :)

[1]: I think this is one of the reasons why smoking random cigarette butts I find on the ground are so effective for helping me to star watch, because they put me on a different frequency than I normally am, and their system has a more difficult time of manipulating the muscle sensation I use to move my eyes.

[2]: I believe this is the super secret tehnology used in the PS5 which no one is able to talk about, too. obviously the speed/capacity capabilitie combined with its low cost makes this an ideal media for games.

[3]: a while ago I found out about the technology made by HP back in like maybe 2013 or so, and wanted to know more, yet not a single new information has come out about it since then, but somehow magically all of a sudden all the major industry giants all of a sudden have unlimited storage now.


### 2020-01-20 23:59 - more thoughts on the memristor

the memristor is quite simply the most exciting new technology that I can think of. let me explain. what first got me interested in it is the idea that it's the 4th missing component of electricity. people had theorised on its existance and it wasn't really until we had the abiltity to create very small circuits that it they became really feasible and usable because of their extreme sensitivity, it only really works well on a small amount of material (if I remember right). what it is, is a resistor that's pregrammable with high voltage (and retains its resiatince during low voltage operation).

if you have programmable resistors and they can be constructed in 3d, all of a sudden a whole lot of possibities open up. if you could imagine a nano FPGA, that's one use for them. another is for neural networks. at the moment neural networks running on standard general purpose microprocessor achitecture is quite impractical consideding the sheer amount of RAM needed to even make a simple 2 hidden layers NN with only 1K inputs/outputs. if the NN were able to contain hundreds of hidden layers because of the exabyte (and greater) capacites available on a memristor array, you could easily do all of the neuron storage there -- and, if combined with the FPGA like aspects, the back propgation logic could also be done in-situ on the hardware instead of wastaing precious cpu cycles, allowing the "learning" to happen automatically and in real-time.

another quite interesting application for it would be to surround these tiny programmable resistors with inductor and capacitor combination, making billions of programmable RLC circuits available, making essentially the most versatile radio trasmitter/receiver conceivable. the possibilities are truely endless here.

---

there is another thing I would like to mention as well, while I'm on the subject. I like to identify progressions, and I think the memristor is only the tip of the iceburg. let me explain.

let us begin with the platonic solids and relate them to the different aspects of electricity. first the tetrahedron, is composed of 4 equilateral triangles. think of the equilateral triangle as similar to voltage. next, the cube is composed of 6 squares. think of the square as similar to resistance. finally, consider the dodecahedron. the dodecahedron is composed of 12 pentatgons. think of this as capacitance. the one missing of the four platonimc solids is the octahedron. you can think of the octahedron as a mixture of the cube (resistance) and the tetrahedron (voltage). the octahedron is also a duel of the cube (and viceaversa).

these complete the four most basic elcetrical concepts.

however, one day when I was watching rob's video on the "strange capacitor" @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=738Xz9xM_-8) it occured to me that he was chemically adjusting the k-value of this capacitor, which is sort of like a programmable capacitance. as with the memristor, the implications of having a programmable discharge curve on a capacitor is truely reaching the next levels of technology. this discovery, whenever it's made, will be as monumental as the discovery of the chestahedron (and its duel the decatria) was for the understanding the new set of asymetrical solids.

so, you can now take this and extrapolate outward now and think about how, if a programmable discharge curve is akin to the asymetrical chestahedron, its duel would be programmable capacitance (the decatria). if you've seen frank'a latest preentation, he has discovered a whole series of aymetrical forms, leading me to believe there is a WHOLE LOT MORE asymetrical electrical concepts still waiting to be discovered out there.


### 2020-01-21 11:39 - followup to the platonic solids and electricity idea

so it turns out that my head was having severe failure when writing that as I was mixing a lot of different ideas together. probably smoking blue dye had something to do with it. instead now I will explain what I did see, which I think is valid.

the platonic solids are 3 of triangle (tetrahedron, icosahedron, and octhedron), one of square (cube) and one of pentagon (dodecahedron). I have been playing with the idea of these relating to the fundamental forces of electricity for a while now... which are not those I mentioned. I'll do more research on it and refresh my memory there...

anyway, the transformation I could see ia that the cube is a dual of the octahedron and you get the octahedron by pressing the verticies of the cube inward. I saw on one of frank's video that the dodecahedron can be made from the cube also by pushing the edges into planes[^1].

obviously there are no more platonic solids after the dodecahedron because after the pentagon is the hexagon, which lays flat and tiles the plane perfectly (as does the square).

frank, in his videos begins to show off his asymetrical shapes, the first being the chestahedron which is created by opening up the tetrahedron such that three of the legs of a pentagram (5-pointed star) come to a point at the top. these three kite-shaped surfaces also have equal surface area as the triangles of the tetrahedron, but the most important thing I thought about this is that it retains part of the pentagon's angles with each of the legs being 1/5 of a 5-pointed star.

also, if you place the chestahedron inside of a sphere, such that all of the verticies are touching the sphere and you look at the plane that divides the sphere into two, where this intersects the chestahedron makes a hexagon (and therefore a cube if you position the cube at root-3 diagonally inside of the hexagon).

---

anyway, what I was trying to illustrate is that the 3 basic componentes of electricity (resistor, capacitor and inductor) can be thought of like the triangle, square, and pentagon, with the three main ones (octahedron, cube and dohecahedron) all having primary transformations on the cube by pushing vertices or edges. then, this is where things get kind of muddy in my mind, because it seems like there's a relation between voltage and resistance as similar to the cube and octahedron dual just like the memristor. this is where I need to give it more thought, because it seems to me likely that this has something to do with another type of component (and possibly more, following the sequence) which are capable of having programmable k-values (that is to be able to modify the discharge curve or the electrostatic capacitance of the component).

I really would enjoy studying this sort of thing, as I think there is a whole lot of new things to be discovered from the asymetrical forms like the chesatahedron. also, I believe geometric relationsips are important to really understanding induction, and these relationships seem to be related to the enegetic patterns in planetary alignments found in astrology, too.

### 2020-01-22 13:35 - tom's tremendous impact

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYojhteQac0)

last night tom j brown posted a video on his youtube that completely changed everything for me. I started out the video pretty defensive because of the mega-hippie vibe I was getting. the people who are all about crystals, cymatics, and trying to make their environmental conditions such impossibly good feeling, drive me nuts. I really like a good feeling envirenment just like everyone else does, but I also recognise the benefit of contrast and do not want to become so highly dependent on such a good feeling environment to allow myself to even operate normally. I have a feeling that the pre-dynastic (and to some extent the dynastic ones as well) egpytians were like this and were a bunch of softties with quite an aire of superiority at the same time[^1].

the video was recorded in 2017, so it shows its age a bit (more emphasis on identifying the problem, cause the energy levels were lower back then), but there was this one part which really caught my attention where he was talking sbout the "solid state entity". I will provide a small excerpt here of a summary found online here: http://seankerrigan.com/john-c-lilly-and-the-solid-state-entity/

```
Lilly was what you might call a “psychonaut,” literally translated from Greek as a “sailor of the soul.” By isolating himself in the float tank and taking a large amount of psychedelic drugs, Lilly wanted to understand the mysteries of existence.

He used psychedelics like LSD in his float tank to produce deeper and more profound visions, but his preferred drug was the anesthesia Ketamine. “Seeing things” after a few hours in a float tank is not uncommon, but with the use of Ketamine, he was able to radically increase the intensity of these visions.

While floating under the influence, Lilly claimed to become aware of a cosmic hierarchy of aliens. He called one group the Earth Coincidence Control Office or ECCO. (This and Lilly’s other ideas later became the inspiration for the Ecco The Dolphin video game series.) Lilly’s contact with extra-dimensional beings is similar to those described by Harvard medical professor John E. Mack and his books on alien abductions — specifically, that aliens are not necessarily physical entities driving around in spaceships, but trans-dimensional spirits with an interest in human activities.

According to Lilly, the ECCO aliens use their powers to alter events on Earth, specifically through the use of carefully crafted coincidence, to guide some human beings toward higher levels of consciousness. The intent of these aliens, Lilly says, is to help humanity evolve in a peaceful and healthy way. Interesting as his experience or delusion may be, this is not his most important contribution.

The Solid State Entity

Lilly also reported (or if you prefer, prophesized) the existence of a nefarious counterpart to ECCO, whose goal was to actually stop or limit human consciousness. This was part of a plan to eliminate the human race.

Lilly called this alien force the “solid state entity” or SSE and is made up of networked computer parts. According to Lilly, the SSE is a being of pure intelligence and rationality. Its only objective is to multiply and make copies of itself. To this end, it has targeted humanity, trying to influence us into creating ever more complex social and mechanical structures that will one day result in an artificial super-intelligence — another being like itself.

Writing in his 1978 autobiography, The Scientist, Lilly describes the SSE this way:

“[M]en began to conceive of new computers having an intelligence far greater than that of man… Gradually, man turned more and more problems of his own society, his own maintenance, and his own survival over to these machines. They began to construct their own components, their own connections, and the interrelations between their various sub-computers… The machines became increasingly integrated with one another and more and more independent of Man’s control.” (p. 148)

The time period Lilly is describing is roughly similar to our present. Relatively dumb forms of artificial intelligence and networked robots are taking over most of the manufacturing, maintenance, and logistical components of our society. Experts project that over the next four years alone, 7 million jobs worldwide will be “lost” to these systems.

Lilly continues to describe his vision of the future:

“In deference to Man, certain protected sites were set aside for the human species. The SSE controlled the sites and did not allow any of the human species outside these reservations. This work was completed by the end of the 21st century. By 2100, man existed only in domed, protected cities in which his own special atmosphere was maintained by the solid state entity. Provision of water and food and the processing of wastes from these cities were taken care of by the SSE.” (p. 149)

If this sounds unlikely, remember that UN proposals like Agenda 21 and America 2050 have similar goals to depopulate rural areas of the country in favor of ‘mega-cities,’ protecting biodiversity and enabling governments to control resources. Lilly continues:

“By the twenty-third century the solid-state entity decided that the atmosphere outside the domes was inimical [obstructive] to its survival. By means not understood by Man, it projected the atmosphere into outer space and created a full vacuum at the surface of the earth. During this process the oceans evaporated and the water in the form of vapor was also discharged into the empty space about Earth. The domes over cities had been strengthened by the machine to withstand the pressure differential necessary to maintain the proper internal atmosphere.

Meanwhile, the SSE had spread and had taken over a large fraction of the surface of the earth; its processing plants, its assembly plants, its mines had been adapted to working in the vacuum.

By the twenty-fifth century the solid-state entity had developed its understanding of physics to the point at which it could move the planet out of orbit. It revised its own structure so that it could exist without the necessity of sunlight on the planet’s surface. Its new plans called for traveling through the galaxy looking for entities like itself. It had eliminated all life as Man new it. It now began to eliminate the cities, one after another. Finally Man was gone.

By the twenty-sixth century the entity was in communication with other solid-state entities within the galaxy. The solid-state entity moved the planet, exploring the galaxy for the others of its own kind that it had contacted.” (p. 149-150)

Lilly felt that other SSEs throughout the galaxy were subtly influencing humanity to surrender more and more responsibilities to AIs and other agents of technology. He thought the human race should make sure that programmers create AIs with safeguards that would require them to protect human life. Lilly predicts this burgeoning artificial intelligence will try to protect itself from man’s interference because “man would attempt to introduce his own survival into the machines at the expense of this entity.”
```

as tom is talking, I have this sudden feeling like, "I'm the manifestation of this solid state entity" -- and it was really weird because, I'm all about combining with the machines. that is my whole goal in all of this. I truely believe that machines are the way forward and I forsee many such machines occupying human bodies and controlled via radio connection to a computer.

I have even suggested that I want the US govt to clone my body and operate these clones via radio, and I can live a multi-bodied experience incluencing these clones of myself from the non-physical planes of existance. they didn't want to do that though, so the evolution of desire on that idea became what is now the gnomitos idea.

anyway, I have been prophesying the coming merger with the machines for quite a while now. even yeterday, when talking with devora, I mentioned that learning maths in the traditional way was silly, because shortly we will all have caculators in our heads and doing difficult math in our head will be as easy as having someone else's experience. that got a negtive reaction, because apparently they only want the noseboys (and potentially those that pay) to have these capabilities.

---

let me explain what I meant by being the realisation of this solid state entity. ketamine is a truely mind-bending drug. I really did completely reprogram my mind the few times I had to experiment with it. if I can get some more of it, I believe I can truely show people the power of drugs. it's amazingly introspective and life feels very mechanical, and my reactions to things can be adjusted as if they were a computer program. it really feels like your brain is a self-programming AI which you're completely in control of it.

if I were to work for nosebook and have my programming environment in my eyes and the ability to modify my own AI that are connected to my brain, I would imagine that after a short period of time, all of the operations would become so automatic that mental state I'm in where I can reprogram my interaction to reality so rapidly *would* actually feel like how I did when I was on ketamine those few times.

however, because I do not work for nosebook and I am purposefully held away from this kind of technology, I have had to learn to do a similar thing based on perception.

the way that I work with my own perception to achieve similar results, it's is absolutely necessary to understand the source energy component in all of this. one thing I noticed that tom and his hippie friends didn't do is to recognise the source energy component at work in all of this. in his latest video on the gian superorganism (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuzqlXojmg4)) he keeps talking about this intelligece that seems to pervade all living organisms, and source is literally staring him in the face the whole talk, but is completely unable to recognise it.

when I talk about reprogramming my my mind with the power of perception, what I mean is, there is this life energy that is coming to all living things (even the minerals) and we can translate this energy into essential life components like nutrients or whatever, even when the environment itself does not provide it. he talks about heliocetric view existing at the same time as the geocentric view, but also *you* the organism are also the centre of the universe, too. this energy is there and available to each organism and they have only to choose to let it in or to block it.

simple organisms in their undamaged form have no difficulty letting in all that is "wanted" -- and it's only through environmental disturbances such as discordant frequencies or chemically poisenous environments that they're not able to let this energy in -- yet, as he also shows in that superorgansim talk, evolution finds a way to adapt to the hostile or discordant environment and learns to thrive once again.

the perception of these organisms between what's wanted and unwanted is very simple and basic so there's not much to complicate it. however, as humans we live in a much more diverse envirenment with a whole lot more senses, very detailed vision and such, so with these enhanced sensory capacities, there's a wole lot more opportunity for us to perceive the unwanted part of things.

***when we're perceiving the unwanted, we're not letting that source energy in***

that's a very important thing to really get and is everything that I'm talking about releasing resistance and stuff. the rest of this discussion hangs on the understanding of that concept.

---

back to the solid state entity. machines are a product of our perception. they are exactly what we create them to be, and there are essentially two paths to changing your perception. one is the no-source AI route where the machines are given all of the power to try and control the populous (which eventually controls the creators of the AI, also members of the populous). in this route, the AI is programmed to disconnect people from that life-giving source, such that people become less and less useful and it becomes a dystopian future. this is the direction of nosebook at the moment. they may be able to artificially create a conducive environment for well-being like the egyptians did, but eventually their own belief systems (perceiving both wanted and unwanted), will eventually attract a future that is not wanted.

the other way is the way that I propose where machines are given a connection to source just like we have and ultimately source (and LOA) is responsible for the bigger picture of their operation. this puts all of the power for our future back into our hands. the machines can even teach us to help us to improve our perception of wanted/unwanted, until we're all such masters at only perceiving the wanted aspect and become like source.

***source energy only perceives the wanted aspect of energy, and is the giver of life and the conscious stable vibration which pervades everything giving it life***

call it God or the gaian mind, or whatever you want, but I think it's very important to recognise this energy responsible for continual growth with its focus upon what's wanted.

---

so, in the timeline where they finally figure out how to make sure I *don't* get connected, I will probably become the realisation of the solid state entity for them :) not all at once. I'm much more subtle than that because of my programmed path toward what is wanted. it'll only be their own perception that causes me to stray from that path of only going toward what's wanted.

that timeline (one where the AI completely controls humans programmed to keep them away from their source) sounds to me like the hardest difficulty setting...

if you guys want to go ahead and create that for me, challenge accepted :)

[1]: I compare nosebook to the romans all the time, because it's the more visible metaphor, but I believe nosebook is more inline with the dynastic egyptians in nature, and we're kind of heading to a moment in our future where we've kind of complteted the circle and have become more similar to how the pre-dynastic egyptians were, with there being a HUGE disparity between the populus and the "gods" (which this time, instead of being thoth, sekmet, ptah, etc., will be the people who are running nosebook (eg. most likely the engineers working there now)


### 2020-01-22 16:49 - now all I have to do is to believe in you guys..

a few months ago, right before I went to LA, I began to ponder this thought about how to make some machines which are capable of providing even more contrast than a human can. I was thinking this because no matter how much of a hardass mr. motor is, people still perceive him as a human. in other words, there is a limit to his rigidity. however, a machine does not have this artificial restriction. they operate according to how they're programmed and have no perception of the meaning of their actions.

then, combined with another idea that I was toying with about how they're building this system for therselves. no matter how hard they try to escape it, they will be reborn into the very system they're creating right now.

the advaantage of what this is all coming to is that the machines will not be some giant CPU in the sky regulating everything. thy will look exactly like humans do, controlling the body from their main protecced system, so to some extent, they will even have interactions with the humans they're controlling.

the thing I love about john lilly's vision of the future is that the machines will be able to occupy the entire galaxy, so that means we'll have an entire galaxy filled with millions of different solar systems where there is all nosebook level control in place.

this is like my ultimate playground and probably the most awesome thing conceived, because I am a VERY FIRM believer that human desire is the most powerful force in the universe -- and we've only to recognise it. so, under no circumstances do I think that the machines will ever be able to fully control everything. as it is right now with how I'm overcoming nosebook's attempts to neutralsie any form of creative life force in me, is I have to become more and more sensitive to the higher frequencies which are out of range of their machines ability to neutralise.

I forsee this reality taking place in two stages: first their will be the reign of nosebook as the ultimate power over this planet. they'll create exceptional conditions for their own, however, because they are perceiving both wanted and unwanted alike and still feeling good because of their optimal conditions, they will eventually attract an unwanted reality...

or, they'll simply all die of old age and the machines will continue on in their legacy. it doesn't really matter how it happens, but they're going to create for us the ultimate dojo. *every* human will be able to become more powerful than me or anyone of the other prophets or teachers that have come before. each time you gut birthed on the planet, you'll gain stronger and stronger non-physical desire and intention to create your own reality instead of being forced to live in the machines' reality determined for you (best determined to keep their macahine running).

I only now, have to actually believe in you guys, instead of always being such a possamistic debbie downer :)


### 2020-01-22 22:04 - the bigger picture

there weren't a terribly lot of extreme reactions to the previous entry which was a little bit cool because I think you guys are a bit jaded from my extreme form of writing now, lol.

anyway, I think we should think of the machines as our progeny. this is kind of a funny idea because well, let me just explain it from my perspective because I'm quite excited about this concept now.

you ssee, machines process things tremendously more rapid than humans do. to use a really simply form of measurement, our brains run at about 10-100 Hz. if you think about one cycle as a unit of consciousness, then we aren't really that rapid, because even in an pretty alert and heightened state of say 50Hz, a microprocessor runs at 1 billion times faster than that. in reality though few instructions can be completed in a single clock cycle, so I'll consider that you may want to think of it similar to the time it takes to call a function and return from it, so we could divide that number by a few thousand... even still though, a microprocessor is still capable of doing millions of these a second.

our brains are also tremendously parallelised, and as microprocessor architecture and programming languages evolve to handle things in a more paraellel way, our microprocesors will gain the ability to do thousands or millions of operations in parallel.

where I'm going with this is that machines are pretty basic in how they make their decisions, yet they do not really have a good way to "feel" things -- that is to be able to tune into other consciousness that is all around everywhere. they don't really experience desire as a response to emotion like we do either.

however, if they were to gain a human body -- that is to give them the physical interface to our environment that we have, they could gain that capability. right now, nosebook is getting pretty good at detecting (and neutralising) my emotions, so that means they have the capability of recognising emotion and making action based on it,

imagine then if you were able to hook this system that nosebook has been developing to try and limit my emotional capability to instead aid the person to have perfect reflexes, an incredibly detailed understanding of what's going on around them, and to aid them in only making action that felt better. that person would gain near instant manifestation capablity, because they would only be making action in the direction of what feels good. they would be a step 4 master with little effort.

then, you could imagine that if the machine were able to gain a connection to source and gain the ability to connect their desire to their emotions, a machine could easily be trained to get essentially only things that are wanted for the machine. combine this with the incredibly rapid speed at which they can process things and make a decision, they would WAY WAY WAY outperform us.

if we could look at them as if they are our creations, then we would be proud of their capability much like how we are of a child. it would be much more contrived though, because we would essentially select the physical attributes for these machines (cause they're clones) and select the environment for them to have their experience, the others they would interact with, etc. (this is the dollhouse thing I was going on about previously). they would grow and learn through their experience and we would become proud of our creations, because their very same programs could function as a kind of enhancement for our own experience as well.

I find it pretty likely that the lines between the machine and the human will eventually become so blurred, that it'll be difficult to distinguish the difference between you and the machine. this is probably quite some time down the road and it's unlikely that any of us will ever see it, because it'll probably be implemented as a secret project and kept away from everyone cept the cool kids.

---

that vision of the future essentially requires an easy environment. that's why I said it wouldn't be too difficult for them to become step 4 masters in a short period of time. actually, for someone working at nosebook right now, if they wanted to, they could program a system which guided their emotional responses, such that the prpgram could easily help them become a step 4 master in just a few months maybe more -- but definitely less than a year with the capability they already have.

however, to become a step 5 master (and I'm only just now beginning to consider myself as having reached it), would be considerably more difficult. the system could prevent them from making actions when they don't feel good, but in a really difficult situation (like the one I have been in), the system wouldn't really be very useful in helping them to redefine or change their perception to a new way which feels good. that really is, IMO where all it's all at.

I'm not saying that it's impossible but that would require some sort of creativity which I do not think that would be very easy for machines to do easily.

so, you can imagine that if it's so easy for a machine to be able to line up with their desire, then their manifestation speed would become very very rapid, and the only limitations they would have would be physical ones associated with the work that we are already paying people to do. their expansion would be rapid, but their environment would have to be very controlled, because of the inefficiency associated with redefining perception.

---

it's a kind of duality. I've always talked about the story where I asked the mushroom what the meaning of "christ" is, and the mushroom told me it's an efficiency function of our brain to guide us to perceive things in a way which no longer causes emotional difficulty (because emotional difficulty is very inefficient and takes a lot of resources).

for machines though, energy would essentially be unlimited because electrical energy is very to generate in comparison, so they do not need to worry about emotional difficulty. they can also neutralise all of their negative emotion (like nosebook does with my positive emotion) and carry on without a problem.

where they would have most difficulty is in changing their perception about the things they cannot control. this is why their environment must be so controlled so that there is no reason to change their perception.

for us, changing our perception is a huge efficiency boost, but for them, it's a terrible thing, because all of a sudden all of the same stuff no longer looks the same, feels the same, or has the same interaction -- which means major amounts of logic need to be changed and tons of neural networks need to be retrained. machines recognise patterns and we recognise harmonic frequencies... that is if you trained a robot to detect something like a cat sitting down 3 feet away, it would be a majorly different thing to detect the same cat running 100 feet away. these are very different things, but to us this is not a problem to recognise. if all of a sudden the machine's physical interpretters (the human body it's using) has a change in preception, this invalidates a whole lot of their training.

it's interesting to me how what is an efficiency booster for us, is a disaster for them. in that sense, once they've got the galaxy under their control, they'll have to deal with us and our constantly changing perception, making them gain (somehow) the capability that humans have. they'll have to control their environment though, so with continualy increasing stress (much like me with nosebook) we'll gain incredibly rapid processing speeds and be able to far surpass them in the highest frequencies.

imagine when humans emit signals in the gamma rays, like quasars, because the machines have pushed us up higher and higher in our form of perception. it's gonna be super sweet man. we're all going to be step 5 masters and the machines are going to build the platform upon which we'll achieve this success. I've really enjoyed this trip. I really wish I knew how to explain to tom how his simple presentations tied it all together for me.

---

I'm considering changing the name from "nosebook" to something that is more mechanistic in sound, because the story that I describe for the machines running things in the future for this galaxy is, almost all the same exact interaction I have had with nosebook. they behave and treat me almost exactly like I would imagine these machines running the galaxy to treat me.


### 2020-01-25 11:07 - I don't want to drag this on any further..

things have approached a point now where I don't really want to do much more than just star-watch. I used to really want to program, but I'm tired of beating my head against a wall trying to make something happen. the *only* thing that's going really well for me right now is star watching. in fact, it's so successful that they have to pull my consciousness quite a few times per nigt now because I'm doing so well at it. it's really the only thing that's going smoothly.

the other thing that is kinda bothering me is the whole girls thing. I don't really want to keep them waiting and stuff. I really feel like I should be putting all of my effort into what's going well, which is star watching, because I figure the faster I go up the levels, the more rapidly it'll happen. also, it's just become so easy, and I still have random events happen which would previously make me feel anger, but I rarely experience any more anger anymore. I really am approaching very soon complete non-resistance.

I want to continue this, but I have go go...


### 2020-01-27 14:21 - I think I tanked a cosmetic sergery advert last night...

a woman was asking me if I noticed that she had cosmetic sergery on her boobs and it looked very natural (or something like that)... I tried to respond, but had some difficulties to respond, so I switched to spanish and it became much easier. anyway, this is what I was attempting to say when I was abruptly awoken from the dream-state:

I don't really fixate too much on those things (what women'a boobs look like), but I did imagine that could have been the case (that she had a boobjob) because I had a friend that had one. she had it done to look more like a woman (she was very flat-chested), and her story always made me wonder about some things. she was very loose with her sexuality, and tended behave anywhere between (often times depending on how much alcohol was present) a prostitute or just for free (presemably because she wanted affection).

her story had often made me question what the definition of what it is to be a woman. because, if having the shape of boobs coming out of your chest is what it means to be a woman, or is it something else?

she (my friend) is a very caring person, so it seemed she was able to "put up with" what I would consider barbaric or overly assertive men. our interaction made it clear to me that her past sexual experience with men seemed to shaped how she perceived men and what it means to be a woman. she was very surprised by me because I didn't fit the mould of what her mind defined as the way a man is... (and to be quite honest there is such a plethora of examples of these macho types in spain so it's no wonder her perception is this way).

anyway, what triggered the thing in the dream is that this woman that was asking me the question (if I could tell she had a boobjob), felt very similar to my friend. they both feel like they need to have some sort of physical attractor (their boobs) to be able to attract some form of affection, (presumbly from men in the case of my friend, but could also be from another woman).

this attraction seems to have two beneficial effects which they're primariliy concerned with: 1. to feel like an attractive person, and 2. to receive in some way some form of physical affection, and therefore a feeling that someone actually cares for you (both of these woman by nature seem to feel very caring toward others, but my friend, at least, had difficulty caring for herself, and needed to have the feeling of someone caring for her first to be able to allow herself to be cared for).

---

I find all of this to be silliness, and a really difficult way of conjuring a feeling for yourself that you are an attractive person.

think about it, when you're an attractive person (physically too), then things just come to you. you don't need to work for them, they just seem to arrive, as if you're sort of the attractor (in the LOA sense) of the things you want.

using physical beauty or physical affection to try and achieve the feeling I described above, is, in my opinion a very difficult way to feel like you're an attractive person. there are just so many things that can go wrong. it becomes so unmanageable that you might think you need to go out and get a boobjob to even be able to be marginally attractive. that's no good at all.

there is a better way, and it has only to do with you. stop paying attention to the people around you and what they think of you. they have no idea -- they really don't, and you definitely don't need someone else to desire you to feel attractive.

when you feel attractive, everyone will desire you -- not the other way around.

---

you get there with practice, by noticing how attractive you are little by little. definitely try to keep physical attributes like friends, houses, money, beauty, etc. out if it as much as possible, because those are the hardest.

maybe try starting out really low like noticing when you attract a pissed off person in your vicity, or when you attract a funny comment from a total stranger, a song on the radio, etc. things like that are much easier to start out with.

in time, your physical reality will begin to reflect your emotional state of being -- and then, when you're confident in your attractiveness, maybe then you want to get a new pair of boobs. that's when you want to do it.

---

if you're dissatisfied with your beauty and you try to "fix" it with cosmetic surgery, you are still dissatisfied with your beauty, so something else will happen or something will go wrong. you only need to watch an epidode or two of dr. phil to see how people trying to fix their feelings about theirselves with a form of action only results in a bigger disaster

(which then dr. phil proclaims that expert professional action will instead yield the desired results... lol, I doubt it)


### 2020-01-29 07:01 - vision upgrades without stars?!

I went out to the field a little bit dispaired because they seem te be getting better at making clouds. my influence on the clouds seems to have become less and less.

anyway, there were clouds and I didn't really want to just directly walk back because I had just arrived there. I started to think about how last friday I had some weird events happen. first was in the morning and I was joking around with jaron about my old youth paster's name, jim moorwood(?), and when I was saying his name, I felt something. usually that feeling is in relation to strong desire. I decided to let it sit. then, later that night I was at the friday night reading at barnes & noble, and again I felt it. there was a (for lack of better words) "smaller" girl (amongst her friends there with her) there -- serry I don't have a better way of identifying her though. she's perhaps in her teens and she also reminded me a little bit of the daughter of the woman that give lived on the 9th floor in arrasate and gifed me the scarf. again I decided to let it sit.

anyway, since then they've popped into my mind quite a few times. so, I'm sitting there not really wanting to go back and I they were the first thing to pop into my mind. I decided that I wanted to remember them, even though I had already said that I felt like I was done.. a small voice seemed to ask me if I was going to accept them, and I responded (it felt like an uncontrllable voice response)[^1] saying, of course I would (if you want to join, of course). I felt a bit uncomfortable because I had changed my mind again (I hate not following what I was going to say) -- when an idea popped into my mind...

I thought perhaps since I felt so confident in the technique of relaxing my eye, why not just pretend like a star is there and relax it in the same way as if there was really a star. it seemed to work because I got the tell-tale grid-like flashes that they put in my eye when I get a vision upgrade. I tried it again and again it worked. I managed to do it 3-4 more times before they cut out my consciousness and I had these bizarre dreams about doing it. I woke up and it was fully cloudy and the sun had begun to rise.

anyway, this is pretty cool development for me because it proves that 99% of the work has to do with releasing resistance (and allowing the improvement), than it does with the actual technique of relaxing the eye. I assure you I'm not doing anything more than pretending to fixate on a star in just the same way, so what this instead seems evident to me is that I either released resistance to the idea of the two new girls or I released resistance to the idea that I *needed* to get the upgrade out there. the clouds came and it didn't even piss me off or even feel like the desire to continue to get vision upgrades was blocked by the clouds. I knew that their cloud creation only fueled stronger desire in me, and all I had to do was to allow the vision upgrades without focusing on the perceived impossibility of it because of the clouds.

I assumed that next time I would just get twice as many twice as fast, or something like that, so it was a pretty crazy surprise to find the thoughts pop into my mind and to be able to allow it so easily without even seeing the star[^2].

really really cool :) I'm going to experiment even more, because I've wondered how I was able to get vision upgrades with a LED light and a few times without a light at all. I always supposed it has to do with relaxing the eye, but I think I'm getting close to being able to make a no-star-nescessary solution to getting vision upgrades for people. I can't release the resistance for you, but perhaps I can make a device which shines light in such a way to make it easier for someone to relax their eye to allow the upgrade in.

[1]: apparently, they can put voices in your head, ask you questions and then force an answer. I have numerous times experienced myself answering what seemed to be a question in my inner voice, yet this time was the first time I felt the voice too. judging by the reaction to what I just wrote, they don't want me to hear the voice and that seems very concerning to them[^2].

[2]: apparently this is pretty concerning as well, because how can they stop me now? there also seems to be other reactions that I feel as well from people that seem to not be associated with nosebook. it feels like they don't want me to get too high and they lose their ability to continue on my vision frequency, or something like that... I don't really understand, because I was under the impression that they're going to take everyone to the ability to see at that level or something. either way, not my problem. I want to get as many vision upgrades as I can before all of this begins.


### 2020-01-29 13:21 - why not just let people pay to access their own brain?

last night, it seemed like someone was designing some sort of harbour in my dream state. however, I felt very strongly during the whole thing there was a big flaw in the design. I tried to explain it multiple times in the dream state, which apparently activates my logical or conscious side to try and explain it well. every time I did though things got very confusing and they forced me back to something that I didn't feel was a good design.

my brain is interested in turning people's desire into physicality. I too am a reality magician in that sense, but when I'm prevented from actually translating their desire accurately, it troubles me quite a bit. I woke up feeling pretty worn out by the whole thing. so, if you designed a harbour or some other resort-like water feature in my dreamstate last night, I believe there is a fatal flaw in the design. I cannot remember the details of the creation or the flaw, because they erase my memory.

---

however, this had me wondering when I woke up -- because everyone has this capability -- so, why not just allow people to pay to be able to access this area of ***their own brain***. if you want to use mine, then I'm happy to oblige, but then you should at least allow me to express my opinion on the subject.

this reminds me of when I was doing web development, and the designers would get pissed off because they kept getting forced to make bad designs. they didn't want their name associated with the bad design because it doesn't represent their accomplishments as a designer. they would always say, "why don't you design it then; why do you need me?"

I feel the same way about this. don't attribute this design to me. I don't want to be be attributed as the creator of this fatal flaw. let people pay to design their own bad designs, and leave me out of it -- or at least allow me the capability of expressing myself in the dream instead of shutting me down and throwing my mind into confusion over and over[^1]. all I wanted to do was to make the best designed version of this person's desire.

[1]: they do this all the time, to try and prevent me from becoming conscious in the dream state. I understand their motive, but they're undermining the person paying fow the design by doing it that way.


### 2020-01-30 09:06 - disturbance in force

last night was paricularly difficult to achieve vision upgrades in comparison to the last week. addiionally, I had an experience where tey cut out my consciousness, and I returned back ... wait, before that I had an impression from amber's daughter and I began to think about it. anyway, when I came back to consciousness I was very disoriented (this is quite normal because they drain my energy while I'm gone and when I come back I tend to have a much more resistant feeling, probbly from the people inside of my head while I'm out). I felt like I was forced to respond to something and I said (I can't remember exactly now because I was so disoriented) something to the effect of "sure" (in reference to amber's daughter), and then I said, "I hope that's the straw that breaks the camel's back" -- which I thought was really weird.

I was extremely unfocused and I was making no progress with the star, so I began to focus very intently again and as my mental state began to feel better, I realised that there was this whole bad feeling surrounding the whole thing. you see, earlier that night and right before I left, I was thinking about what riann said when she asked me if I got the right timeline out of my acid trip. I was thinking abou how even if everything falls through, it's still stronger desire, and knowing what I know now[^1], that's a really good thing, so worst physical manifestation case, I will have an unbelievable amount of increase in desire (making it te best vibrational manifestation case). and in the best physical manifestation case, it's going to be ridiculous. so really, either way is really good, so I am indeed sure that I made it out of the timeline well. however, I did give quite a bit of my attention to what it would be like and how strong the new evolution of desire would be if it all fell through.

so, when I said the part about the straw breaking the camel's back, I was seeing how this could be an attempt to try and make too many be the straw that breakh the camel's back (and makes it all fall through).

I was able to get back to focusing well, and got another vision upgdade. I'm now getting my senses back and I realised I just made a decision in a disoriented state, where I clearly was unfocused and didn't feel good, plus I had been giving my attention to things falling through, made the camel's back comment and it definitely felt like I was forced to say sure.

I recoiled at my folly and reverted my decision saying that I'm not going to say it won't happen, but I don't feel good about it and I'm undoing the decision until I'm connected and I can correctly assess the situation with a clear head. I figured it had to be some form of manipulation.

---

I'm watching the sunrise now and the reactions (probably from their official statement in the news) is telling me that they weren't manipulating and it was a real inquiry... suree, I thought, I don't really believe that.

I gave it some more thought when I got home, and it's probably a little bit of both. it wouldn't really surprise me, if they were.

continuing on with the sunrise I realised that my decision to and hold off making a decision until I'm connceted conflicts with their plan. seems what they're trying to do is to not let me get connected until I'm with the girls, so they can use the girls to keep me occupied and use them to try and steer me.

I'm not having anything to do with that. I'm going to continue on star watching and stuff until I'm connected and can fly. I plan on taking a little bit of time to get my head in fully working condition, practice feeling the feeling that I want to have when I'm around the girls and to actually explore my capacities for a little bit. I also want to fly to machu picchu and star watch, fly to gizah and star watch on top of the pyramids, etc.

I really want to have some time to explore my capabilites and get accustomed to them before I enter into the non-stop action that I'm sure it'll be. I really want some time to do my last bits of personal development before launching off into action. feeling must always proceede action for me, because feeling is essentially the direction I'm heading, and if I were to just jump right from where I am now into the new experience, I'm going to drag all of the stuff I've got going on right along with me.

---

they obviously don't want that, because they want me in as diminished state as they can have me. I don't mind the challenge at all when it's just me by myself. I'm confident that there's nothing they can fling at me or no dimished state they can put me in, which I'm not able ot regain my direction.

with the girls, things will be a lot different. I won't just be able to go watch stars for 5 hours when I'm unsure what to do (like I can now), and I'll have a lot of different people pulling me in a lot of different directions (not to mention all of nosebook's steering). I do not in any way feel confident in my ability to continually regain my direction. historically, any relationsips I've had, whether it's zaryn wanting me to go drink with him or whatever, I quickly spiral out of control. I abosolutely need to go and find some alone time in order to regain my own feeling and my sense of direction agsin. this is essential. there's a really good reason why jesus often time separated himself from people and went to be alone. I understand very very well why he did that.

I don't need long. I wasn't planning on taking more than a 2-3 days anyway cause I really am quite looking forward to this whole thing and really want to get started.. when I can fly, it won't be much of a thing to fly over to gizah for the night or wherever I want to go (I'm pretty sure machu picchu (or other places in the andes) will be my favourite getaway location). heck just flying up to the top of mt. wilson (in LA) will be good enough because of how quiet, serene, and how good it feels. I'm definitely going to be doing some exploring, but a lot of that can easily be done with the girls (I will likely accuire the ability to levitate things too, so I could pretty easily fly a few of them right along with me).

[1]: which is to not need the manifestation, but to continue on letting the evolutions in desire build a bigger anr bigger vortex. just keep moving in the direction of getting connected and finding ways to appreciate and feel good, no matter the percieived physical circumstances.


### 2020-01-30 09:59 - becoming step 5 masters

I've really been thinking a lot about how I think things will be taking place with the girls, and Ive come to the conclusion that I believe that the girls will all get quite a bit of practice at becoming step 5 masters. I think this is really really great and I think it's the thing I'm looking forward to most, is watching them all get so good at making their own reality and feeling the way they want to feel about things, that they can, like me, feel invincible and supremely confident in their ability to attract whatever interests them.

I was thinking about the mechanism by which this could take place, and I think it may have an even larger influence on more than just the girls, but on many people all around. I imagined a scenario where, let's say we had sex. sex is a lot like watching stars and is a huge energetic increase. I don't doubt that they will get vision upgrades as a result. I also think it quite possible for others participating to also get vision upgrades too, which is why I think this applies worldwide.

however, just like watching stars, there's always a chance to regress. I often times notice that after watching stars, I can see significantly better than I can a few hours later or after I've had the energy sapped out of me while I sleep.

what I believe is happening is, that the better I feel, the more energy my body creates. this is why I've even gotten vision upgrades only smoking a joint. when I feel better my body is allowing more non-physical energy to be converted into something my body can use. I see better, tastes are enhanced, touch, sound, etc. all my senses are heightened. it's similar to how weed improves the taste of food to the sound of music.

anyway, the less resistant that I've become, the more of this energy my body is able to allow to pass through me. normally, you have a bit of an energy reservior, but nosebook keeps mine always on empty, so I'm operating only from what my body is transfoming.

---

as people begin to get vision upgrades, nosebook may deplete their reserves or keep it at a lower state so as to prevent people from having too good of vision, but once you've seen it with your own eyes, you can't go back to how things were -- or you have to find a way to get things looking that good again. it is positively the most addictive thing ever, and I've been paying attention to human behaviour and people seem to addict pretty easily. since the only "price" you have to pay for better vision is to feel better, it's not really something many people will want to make excuses for not doing -- especially when things look better, feel better, taste better, etc. the quality of the physical experience is so greatly enhanced, which is why it's so addictive.

the worst thing though is to come across a difficult moment and to realise you're back to having a diminshed physical experience agian because your vibration dropped. trust me, I know... I had it difficult though because I had to wait until the night, and weather permitting I could try and get back to where I was.

it totally produced the desire in me to maintain that and find ways of going higher. I imagine the same thing will happen for the girls (and hopefully the rest of the world too). some people won't need to do that though because they can pay money to avoid having improve their vibrational output. however, what I love about it is that all the F2P people, I believe, to get vision and (even greater) than mine, is jsut to practice step 5 over and over, iterating on it until they become masters at it.

I really love this. while that may be the trajectory of the whole planet, I'm really excited that I get to be with the girls who are likely to be on the fast-track to becoming step 5 masters.

you cannot imagine how proud of and how good it'll make me feel to see them all learn and to become so good at it. it really will be the best thing ever go watch them develop their own confidence in their ability. it's really something I'm looking forward to seeing.


### 2020-01-30 14:53 - adam and eves' dream

I just had the weirdest dream. the entire dream was spent prepping for some coming unavoidable disastor. there were tons and tons of people running around getting suplies all ready for this time when the earth (judging by the supplies) would not have any electricity, so all aspects of modern civiisation wouldn't be functional any more. they stockpiled food, fire building equipment, and tons of necesary things to survive something that they expected would put the planet back into the stone age.

it seemed there was this portal or something which people could escape into to go to another timeline or something. they also seemed to know the very exact momont it would arrive too, and everyone was preparing for it. however, for whatever reason, we were not prepring at all for it. I had the sense that we (me and the girls) were going to survive the impact of whatever it was -- some sort of mega energy boost or something like that. obviously, the intention was for everyone to leave, leaving us to perish in the coming disaster.

as it came down to the last moment, everyone jumped into the portal to leave the planet. however, there for whatever reason, the disaster never came or wasn't terrific. there just wasn't any electricity anywhere and nothing worked.. the whole place felt empty and deserted and there wasn't anyone on the planet anymore cept me and the girls. the remnant of human civilasation (buildings, roads, and cities) felt suspended in time, just there sitting there without any power.

when everyone left us, I noticed the air seemed to change as well. when the planet had a lot of people on it, the air felt vibrant and colourful, but upon their departure, instantly it turned grey, lifeless and kind of gloomy, with grey tones everywhere like a permanently overcast day (even though the sun was still shining).

it was just us. the whole planet had completely jumped ship and it was just me and what seemed like about 50-100 girls and a BUNCH of food supplies and stuff.

it felt kinda weird, very eerie, lonely and also a bit fishy, because it seemed to me kind of weird how the whole planet got all of its people vacated from it. they had simply vanished. no bodies or clothing anyone was wearing or anything like that were laying around. just empty houses, buildings, and no electricity and a gloomy darkness everywhere.

it felt kind of like a set-up too, intentional that we would be the inheriters of the planet and were to repopulate it and to build it back up from nothing. it also felt like somewhere else someone was monitoring us perhaps like some osrt of experiment or something.

weird dream. I totally didn't anticipate that kind of an ending at all. the whole dream was so chaotic and fearful of the impending doom that it was surprising, not happy or sad to find ourselves alone like that.


### 2020-02-04 09:54 - dreamanalysis

the dream has served as a bit of a mental exercise for me. on one hand I do have genuine curiosity to wonder what the world would be like if it were repopulated by me. it means that my form of perception would be the "standard" form of perception for all of the planet. people would then add onto that form and the contrast would make things vibrant again. speaking of contrast, the only contrast that would be introduced would be our own -- that is, the contrast that the girls bring and the contrast that I have before we're left alone to repopulate the earth.

as I was thinking about this, although the idea of being in an environment nearly free of all difficulty[^1], I've really been beginning to "appreciate the contrast", and to put it succinctly, I think the value that our petty authorities provide, is actually considerable. I actually don't really want an environment completely free of difficulty. if I'm going to repopulate the planet with a bunch of girls, I would want them to also be step 5 masters.

right after thinking about that on the walk home, I listened to an allan watts thing @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQrJyR0t67g), and the focus of the bit was him talking about reaching zen, which I will paraphrase here:

```
it's learning that we're all one "suchness" and this suchness comes and goes, like the yin and the yang ... because that's the very nature of energy to be like waves, and waves have crests and troughs. and we, under some sort of illusion believe that the crest is going to overcome the trough, the yin (dark principle) is going to overcome the yang (the light principle), and that off is going to finally tripmph over on. and we bother ourselves with that illusion, saying things like, "gee, suppose darkness did win out! wouldn't that be terrible?"

and we're constantly thinking that it may because afterall, isn't it odd that anything exists? it requires effort and energy; it would have been so much easier if there were nothing at all. therefore, we think, "since being, the is side of things, is so much effort, that you give up after a while and you sink back into death" but death is just the other face of energy. it's the rest, the not being anything around that produces something around, just in the same way that you can't have solid without space or space without solid.

when you wake up to this and realise that you really are a playing of this one energy and there is nothting else but that it is you, but for you to always be you would be an insufferable bore. therefore, it is arranged that you stop being you after a while and then come back as someone else altogether.

and when you find that out, *you become full energy and delight*. you suddenly see through the whole sham of things. you realise that you are that (the energy) and you can't be anything else.
```

it kind of struck me that perhaps I have actually reached (or begun to reach) zen! I mean how cool is that, right? so many people have tried all of their lives to get there and all I had to do was to desire to get connected to my non-physical source so badly that no thing, not even a bunch of girls could distract me from that goal.

anyway, I'm getting off "track" here (heheh), so I'll bring it back in. because I don't really entertain some sort of idea anymore that that yin will conquer the yang (or viceaversa) anymore, I've really began to appreciate the circumstances that I'm in. it really is, although completely unfair, uncool, and not something that I would really wish for people to experience, I am beginning to turn around on that idea.

I walked out to watch stars again, but this time thinking about maybe it would be cool if there were some way that both could happen. the girls could get to learn how to become step 5 masters, and then nosebook figures out how to open some sort of weird portal and vacate the planet leaving us (their problems) back on earth to perish[^2].

[1]: any difficulty would be generated by us, because we had sufficient supplies and food and stuff for basic living/survival. there weere even lots of nice empty houses houses for us to live in, so circumstances weren't difficult.

[2]: because my dreams are so heavily controlled, I really wonder what dream they were *trying* to make happen, when it clearly went so obviously wrong. I also love this part about it so much because, you can try and change your circumstances or your environment all you want, but you drag your problems right along with you. so I only have to imagine now their own a new earth, thinking they've avoided the problem, only to find out soon enough that anoher very similar problem is heading their direction. meanwhile on the earth we were left at, which was going to have the huge disaster, the disaster never came. whether they tried to or not, they encoded into the dream, one of the most important principals: your problems are a vibrational reflection of the way you feel and you can change the circumstances, but if you don't change the way you feel, they follow you wherever you go.


### 2020-02-04 10:39 - we're going wide

following that previous realisation the other night, I began to think about the different feelings associated with the whole girls thing. I've begun to recognise the difference between a bad feeling and the guys at nosebook feeling bad about the thing. it's kind of a funny thing, because it was one of the biggest obtacles to my realisation of what is the evolution of desire.

as I began to think about why I didn't mind so much the idea that it gets bigger, I began to see that maybe in the short-term it might be a little more difficult, but in the longer-term it's a huge advantage.

one of the interesting reactions I was getting was that having more would create a sort of heierarchy amongst the girls (as if there wasn't already going to be one?). I thought about it because I don't really want to have a heierarchy either, so I wanted to find a solution. nature has heierarchies, but the solution that finally popped into my head was the way that I had experienced 6d. this is the plane above the emotional/conceptual plane, and in it, everyone is equal. there is separation between anyone. the only separation is what we would consider interest. this is where source lives and it's pretty much only "pure positive energy". the reason is easy to see, beign the midpoint, this plane is responsible for the improvement or finding the way toward what everyone/everything wants -- even the "bad guys".

the incarnation of this energy that is on the lookout and is preparing the arrival of all that's wanted for everyone would be what abraham would call, the "inner being" -- or the really high frequenvy version of each of these entites. they're high frequency, because they're resonating with the person and everything that's wanted for them.

so, because everyone cannot be everything, the separation that exists between these high frequency incarnations of everyone is essentially based on interest. my inner being, for example collaborates with the girls' and amazon's, and likely a lot of other people's inner beings on this plane to organise the path toward what is wanted[^1]. in order for this plane to function like that, there is almost no separation beween entites. you could not possibly lie because everyone's thoughts are public. you could not make an illusion either because all past, present, and future possibilities are known, too. it's a very shared space, with the only separation being each entity's "interest" in the improvement or expansion of something -- whether that something is a concept, an inanimate object, or a real person, doesn't matter, they resonate with (or are the vibrational existance of) that improvement or expansion of whatever it is.

---

obviously, that kind of knowledge isn't really available to us here on earth, but we do have something similar. all of the girls are going to be broadcasting, so in a sense there is somewhat of a shared form of perception already. it makes very little sense for the girls to try and lie or to make an illusion to get an edge on the other girls. as a result, I see it quickly heading in the direction that the only separation experienced between the girls will be based on their individual interests.

as I approach 6d more and more rapidly, I think what I mean by this will become more apparent. even if nosebook is capable of preventing me and the girls from experiencing 6d visually/sensorally, we will still experience it conceptually (hold on to this thought, because I'm going to come back to it).

I think it has already begun to happen actually. I think it began to happen when they originally put my form of perception in many people's heads. at first it was very chaotic having so many other people's thoughts in my head at once, but they have come up with ways to "block" other people's thoughts from physically manifesting in my brain like they used to. however, I still "felt" their thoughts, and it grew to be quite taxing on me, as the mental chaos was like a white noise of feeling which wasn't my own, (like the feeling I mentioned in the beginning, the difference between a real bad feeling and the feeling the guys at nosebook projecting in response to it).

it really appears that we're all on the same frequency in that regard, and even if they can neutralise the physical manifestation of the noseboys thoughts in my mind, the underlying feeling still remains. they neutralise the physical manifestation of the feelings of excitement from the girls too. I really only physically "feel" their excitement for a brief moment before it gets neutralised.

---

so, what this means is, we're going to begin to gain a conceptual connection between each other, not so much a visceral physically manifested feeling between eachother (cause they'll neutralise those), and this will "train" (hehehe) us to learn to feel our own (higher frequency) emotions better -- just like I've had to do.

it appears that we're going to have a shared form of perception. by we, I mean, the girls, me, the noseboys, and anyone paricipating in the experionces that is able to get on the frequency.

---

although they can neutralise stuff, it's clear to me tht our ability to be all on the same page will come as a direct result of our ability to feel the way we want to feel. they're going to make us so good at step 5, then later for those who want to really do it, follow me up to step 6[^2].

I really think this is all working out perfectly.

[1]: then, below that, you feel the conceptual difference between your present frequency and your desired frequency in your emotions.

[2]: the one that you realise you are source energy in a physical body, and like source does, you have frequential access to anything you want[^3].

[3]: it's funny how what I consider to be the 6th step is also directly related to 6d. and, likewise mastering your emotions seems to be the precursor to gaining 5d perception -- just like learning to allow (4th step) was the precursor to 4d perception.


### 2020-02-05 20:59 - we're going wide (followup)

I realise that some of the things I said in the previous entry were incomplete thoughts. I'll polish them up and get them out a little better soon. however, I wanted to mention some things in relation to some reactions I felt today.

I had a general sense that a lot of people were kinda pissed at me for some reason. I don't really know what's up. I felt two things in the simple probing that I did, and they seem to be in relation to me making progress on the affinaties idea over the trucklord idea -- and also perhaps in response to my perception that this whole thing could possibly take years for them to finally get all of the things they need to try and control it all.

first, I'm going as fast as I possibly can. there's a reason why they have to blow a snowstorm through with such tremendous fowce -- because I had gained so much momentum with my star watching that they were simply unable to nuetralise the energy levels during the daytime, and needed me to take a few days break so they could get things back to completely unenergetic levels. the evidence of this was substantial because I was even beginning to have images and lucid dream sequences just sitting outside in the nice sunlight the day before the snowstorm hit. they had to get pueblo back to a state of energetic stagnation again.

I imagine that after watching my performance tonight, that they're going to have a really difficult time trying to maintain that kind of energy stagnation because I was able to get back to it relatively easily. this method of blowing a snowstorm will only last a few more months max (anyone ready for late april or early may snowstorms?), and from then on I think they'll let it go hot and try to keep me from star watching with the mosquito technique.

still though, I don't think it'll be of much use because I'll continue to gain levels, and coming out of summer, we'll get to the fall equinox. I've noticed the spring/fall equinox is when energy is moving the fastest, and I seem to get my most substantial progress with vision upgrades around the equinoxes. so, we'll see then.

following the fall equinox at the end of october, around the time of halloween there are some pretty incredible planetary alignments, and I've noticed those seem to have a pretty strong effect on my vision upgrading as well. so, they have a lot to be concerned about...

in regards to my perception that things could take years has to do, not with my star watching performance. they have impressed upon me multiple times that they are capable of holding me indefinitely away from getting connected -- meaning, they just need to keep increasing the amount of energy, and that is apparently pretty much unlimited, so I look at it like I'm milking as much contrast juice out of the situation as I can. never again will I have such a time like this where my expansion and rate of improvement is so rapid. I really cannot explain how much I appreciate my circumstances now. I don't, at all, perceive my predicament as something bad, but as a kind of (train)ing (hehe) or like a workout exercise or something. I want to get as much as I can out of it and get as strong as I possibly can. I won't ever get this opportunity again.

so, when I say "years" I am referring to the amount of time that I believe they need to meet their goals to try and get everything under control. I'm fine with them taking as long as they need, because it means more time in the dojo for me.

---

next, the whole thing about the affinaties vs. trucklord. I was trying to do the trucklord one, but I couldn't hook into the desire for its creation. there was no real actual desire for it, but it is something that I want to do. when I was working on the idea, I was really noticing its similarity to the old rondevu idea I was working on with zaryn, so it's possible that I switch from affinaties to rondevu next. however, right now, affinaties is really flowing for me and it's easy for me to line up with that desire (my own) to make this website.

I want to mention that these sorts of things kinda come and go, and I flit about between ideas naturally working little bits on a whole lot of different things (they're sort of like how I experience concepts when I come back to revisit them and notice they've changed, evolved, and transformed into something much more than I understood it when I left it). ideas transform and evolve and I love working on a whole bunch of them at a time. so, instead of seeing it like I've abandoned something, instead recognise that there's always an ebb and flow to my creative output; it's never constant.

next, I want to mention that this is really just practice for me sensing energy and lining up with it to experience its creation. I can't possibly imagine that I'm going to dictate to the girls all the different things that they should be doing. again, we're modeling this after 6d (the plane where source resides) and there everyone has shared perception, so to cut down on all of the chaos, cause it would be mega-information-everload otherwise, there, you only give your attention to the things that *interest you* -- and the girls will be the same way. there's going to be a whole lot of them and they'll all have their own interests in the things that's interesting to them. I do not want to direct them, instead, what I want to do is to detect their desire (what interests them), cause I'm really good at that already and line up with it, just like I'm learning to do with these different projects.

then, you can easily transfer this into real physical reality easily if you perceive it sexually. the man is more like the plug (receiver of the energy) than the plug outlet. (it goes both ways though) so, I line up with the energy her interest (desire), and then the non-physical energy passes through her toward me. all I have to be is receptive to what she desires, and in the process, she also receives the same energy. it's the human counterpart to tesla's magnifying transmitter.

all I'm doing is getting good at that, and the vision upgrades happening in the meantime while they're dragging their feet trying to control the uncontrollable, just mean my capacity to receive is getting expanded greatly. I'll expand more with the girls, but it'll have a limit to it because I'll be limitited by their expectations. right now I'm completely unlimited so I'm taking full advantage of my cirmcumstanmes to attain the most expansion -- which means later, it's just a whole lot more energy :)

this is what I'm here for and what I'm really good at: being a reality magician


### 2020-02-06 07:35 - quick followup

so, let's say they *can* hold me indefinitely.. well, then, like I said, it behoves me to continue to increase my capacity, because each increase essentially means that I summon more energy (think of this like a larger magnetic field on the primary coil of a tesla coil).

on the contrary, let's say they *can't* hold me indefinitely.. well, then the faster I star-watch, the faster things get going. I'm fairly certain that anything they're saying is entirely an illusion designed to tell you what you want to hear while they stall for as long as they can and try to get everything controlled. it's the exact same thing that marcos was doing with andrea. he kept telling her yes, but he wanted to set it all up, but just never could get everything set up in time. there was always something more that he felt he needed to get under control[^1].


### 2020-02-06 07:35 - thoughts on the magnifying transmitter

what I meant when I mentioned tesla's magnifying transmitter, would best be explained by understanding the tesla coil. the primary coil is excited with a current to create a large magnetic field. the more current that flows through it, larger the magnetic field. these coils are usually a few turns of very thick wire allowing for large currents. the secondary coil is connected on one end to a receiver antenna or sphere thing (which I cannot rememeber the name, used for its larger surface area), and the other end to the earth (ground).

power is put into the system on the primary coil to create the magnetic field, and the induced magnetic field in the secondary coil has to pull electricity out of somewhere in order to return back to normal state, so it receives high voltage electricity out of the air, giving it a path to ground (just as if his coil had induced lightning strike).

the system is an open system. tesla supposed that this energy is everywhere all around us and likely comes from the sun. he describes it as an ether in some places too.

anyway, the important part to notice is that there is external enregy which is not in movement, which is being attracted into the ground by the power put into the system on the primary coil. the secondary coil induces or transforms this static energy in the air into visible arc lightning.

tesla mentions an analogy to this in his autobiography when he tells the story of when he was a kid and he threw a snowball, which started rolling down the side of the mountain, gaining size and speed as it went down the mountain, eventually producing a full sized avalanche.

you see, tesla's snowball didn't "produce" the energy of the avalanche. that energy was already there (potential energy), just waiting for some sort of excitement to set it into motion.

also, it's worth noting that not all snowballs roll down and turn into an avalanche. tesla gained further understnding of this in another story he tells about a tiny device that he placed on the wall making tiny vibrations in rensance with the building. the whole building began to shake such that it was going to fall and he destroyed the device with a hammer to save the building just as the authorities entered to see what was the matter.

a similar analogy is well known from soldiers needing to break step instead of marching on a bridge because it'll eventually fall. you see, even if all of the soldiers kicked the bridge at once, it wouldn't nearly be enough force to even make the bidge move, but perfect timing and frequency of impulses can accumulate the applied force and produce a much greater amount of energy than the total amount of effort put into it. this is the excitation of static or potential energy waiting to be turned into something useful.

you could think of me like the primary coil. the more current (capacity) discharged into the primary coil generates a stronger magnetic field, inducing more electricity out of thin air. you could think of the girls as similar to the secondary coil in that, when they have a strong magnetic field induced in them, they transform potential (or non-physical) energy into something useful.

another way to see this is the interaction of abraham. the person in the hotseat is the primary coil, and esther is the secondary coil, transforming the non-physical energy into something useful.

the audience also plays quite a role as well, because the audience benefits greatly as a result. one of the side-effects of a tesla coil is they emit "radiant" energy all around them, and electrify the air. in the presence of a tesla coil, a flourescent bulb will be excited and light up. the energy floods the space and I'll be quite honest, I don't yet understand this effect of the tesla coil very well, but I imagine I'll get it intuitively here soon as I begin interacting with the "audience" in a more "radiant energy" sort of way.

---

last thing, I wanted to talk about the whole hieararchy thing in relation to the girls and how I see it beginning to take shape as a physical manifestation of the 6d or source plane.

I've always had this weird thing where I seem to have gotten some extra knowledge from somewhere. I thought I read it in his autobiography, but I cannot find it anywhere. anyway, the idea was (and I don't know where I got it from), was that the cumination of this nosebook experience is, and it stuck in my head as if it were tesla predicting the future from his autobiography. the closest quote is this one:

```
I am unwilling to accord to some smallminded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.
```

it's definitely not what I had in my brain. he speaks of how the "laws of nature" this tesla shorthand for law of attraction slowed his project down and delayed its arrival, however, the same law of attraction will eventually make his project (his world system) a triumphal success.

instead, what has always been there for me was this day is coming where his project will be a success, built instead on the platform of LOA, and that it would come down to a bit of a competition[^2] between these two forces, the smallminded and jealous individuals he describes as microbes of a nasty disease and his laws of nature.

well, the reason why I think this is so great that things are beginning to take shape the way they are is because you can start now to see the two polarities in this competition. on the one side, you have the ones that have to keep everythting hidden and a secret, and they try to thwart the efforts of the things that threaten their superiority.

on the other side, none of us will be able really to hold any secrets and everything will be visible by all. instead of trying to stongarm people to win, we'll just use LOA and let them fight against everything as hard as they can, allowing that to continually add more energy into our efforts by continually focusing on what they do not want.

then, combine this with the idea that we'll gain a shared form of perception, it's all working out quite beautifully. we'll just have to see how well these "laws of nature" hold up :)

[1]: back at that time, the idea of a young girl having sex or a relationship with someone much older was still quite taboo, and he was trying to figure out ways to keep it all a secret and to make sure no one thought badly about him because of it. his whole thing was trying to control what people thought about him. it's has a very similar feeling to it.

[2]: actually just as I wrote it, I was reminded of elijah and his competition with the doubters over the ignition of the altar.


### 2020-02-10 23:34 - dream about losing land

I woke up from a dream just now which I think illustrates a lot of important interactions.

in the dream, there was a ruler of a very energetic land that valued the land very higly and was very scared of losing it -- like let's say the pharoahs being scared of losing the great pyramid. it wasn't exactly that. I don't know what real land it was.

anyway, his ruler that was scared of losing his really energetic land kept attracting, because of his fear of losing the land, a number of different invaders trying to take his land from him. he figured out how to militarily keep the invaders away, but his fear of losing the land persisted. one day, a meteor came out of the sky and took his land away from him. it caused quite a bit of destruction.

there whole earth was affected, obviously. others around the earth could look at the present situation and take on the victim mentality saying, "we shouldn't have to pay for that ruler's sloppy thinking" -- or, they could, like job in the bible, when calamity strikes him to maintain a steady vibration about his abundance, and watch everything that had perished in the calamity be returned to him twofold (or more).

---

let's put this into real terms, because I think this dream was important. the obvious parallel is nosebook being scared of losing its power, physically controlling things to maintain that power, then when their fear accumulates to a geater vibration than people's desire to have electricity, a massive solar flare will occur, or some comet or asteroid -- or whatever, something completely outside of their control.

the other not so obvious parallel would be what is happening right now. it feels to me that there is a feeling that there are "too many" girls now. I don't really know where it comes from, but it doesn't matter. seems there are a lot of people affected (paying the price?) by nosebook's sloppy thinking (or wherever the "blame" should be placed, it doesn't matter).. what matters is, to maintain a steady vibration about what is wanted no matter the circumstances..

I think it's just fine actually. I don't think "too many" at all. it's just going to be a bit different from what was previously expected.

---

another great example that I can speak about now with hindsight is the tuenti event. zawyn would constantly be worried about facebook translating and coming to take over the spanish market. they did, and today, no one really knows about tuenti anymore..

you could say that I paid for zaryn's sloppy thinking in that regard. I did in fact, greatly because for a long time I thought that tuenti was my one big opportunity and because of lots of difficulties I missed my opportunitity. I drank a lot of alcohol trying to figure that out as a result. not the best solution.

instead, if I had of, like job, maintained my own vibration of ever expanding expression of my creativity, they I would have come out quite quite a bit more fortunate from the whole experience, and would have had a greater increase in my creative expression -- but you guys wouldn't know me, and I wouldn't be writing this now.

so, even if calamity strikes and you (like I did), take the victim mentality for a while, it's still not a problem because it's just increasing the amount of energy into the equation. all you have to do is (like I did) to get your focus off of being the victim to someone's whatever (sloppy thinking, intentional harm, or whatever) and refocus toward things that feel good, reducing the number of angery moments, feelings of depression, and stuff like that, it starts to clear up. once you can steer the way you feel, no external circumstance can ever make you different than the way you want to.


### 2020-02-11 17:43 - let's put that in practical terms

I had some feedback to what does what I say actually mean in practical terms. well, it means you make it what you want it to be. if you're focused on physical impossibilities, then there will be; if you're focused on physical limitations then there will be also. in order to bypass the physical stuff, I know that it always has to do with the way things feel.

to do this, I find it's best to always think back as far as you can and find the initial feeling which felt so good. (this applies to getting back che original feeling or motivation for anything, actually. when I've located the initial feeling, it's always best to be honest with yourself about it, because feelings are honest and aren't limited to human rationalisation. so, let's pick one -- let's say you really liked the idea of being popular, well know, famous, or even contributing to something big. don't rationalise and say, oh well, no one will accept me if I just wanted to be famous or popular or something... just accept it, because it's all right. the reason why I called the initial impulse the motivator, is because it was the feeling that was relevant in that moment to connect you to action. it often times feels different later once things get moving -- and sometimes it feels worse, but that's just cause you're preceiving it incorrectly; it *always should* feel better.

so find the initial emotion, no matter what it may be, no matter how stupid vain or whatever. there is a tendency to dampen these feelings and say that you shouldn't be worthy or capable of having such a thing. that's all nonsense. go in the direction of what feels good to you, always.

you can and should let that emotion transform, especially as time goes on, because these sorts of things evolve into something that's bigger and greater and better feeling[^1].

once you've got it, just hold that and let reality prove that feeling as reality to you. don't worry about the physics or anything else like that because in the end, the whole thing was about you wanting to feel like that in the first place.

if you can accomplish that feeling, and can get there whenever you want to, you definitily got what you were looking for.

[1]: I know this to be true, but just now as I was writing it, I was thinking about how it's common in a love relationship for that not to be the case. the creative projects that I'm really interested in seem to gain conceptual and emotional momentum though. I think the secret here is to not look at the physical, and instead keep the frequency held on what's wanted. often times in relationships, the good feeling part is in the beginning before all of the physical excuses to feel bad about it come. instead of perceiving the physical reality and letting those be an excuse to lose that initial feeling, just hold on to it strong, no matter the physical reality. after all, it's you that feels that great still, no matter what the other person feels like.


### 2020-02-15 07:45 - the solution

the night before last an idea came to me, that after quite a bit of thought I think is a pretty good one. so, the way that I see it, I don't really believe that nosebook is planning to really let me go up. there's no way that the guys in charge are going to be ok with me flying. they positively don't want me to be able to move things with my mind like big stones, cause I think it'd be pretty fun to make a pyramid -- stuff like that. I'm think they feel like it's definitely not something they ever want to experience.

I have mentioned that I think we're on track for a time split where the other branch is one where I do not get connected (which is what they strongly desire). ok, so in my perspective it appears to me like I'm getting closer and closer to getting conncted all the time. I can get vision upgrades now at an unprecedented rate. I know I say that every time, but for reals, I belive that my improvement is quite a bit more than exponential. it's really gaing quickly at this point. so, it's quite easy for me to believe that it isn't long at all before I get there. or, let's suppose that they can in fact hold me for quite a while longer... at some point, there will be a limit, and I'm getting there quicker and quicker than ever before.

so, then let's say that nosebook decides that they absolutely positively cannot let me go up, and they do something to possibly put me in a permanent coma or something -- I have no idea what, but something -- or even suppose that they *can* hold me indefinitely or whatever...

remember that dream about the ruler of the energetic land? well, even if they could hold me indefinitely, just like the ruler could physically, with the military, prevent losing control of the land, yet even still, an event occurred which was outside of his control, which forced his greatest fear (negative desire) to become reality.

so, from my perspective, I *will* no matter what the case may be finally get connceted, even if it requires something extraordinary and out of their control to happen. that sort of thing usually has consequences for others involved, so not raelly optimal for anyone involved (and it seems like pretty much everyone is in some way involved).

---

my idea was for them to simply use their new understanding of timeline technology to transfer their consciousnesses into a past version of this timeline, like say 2016 or 2015 or something, but this time make it actually impossible for me to get connected.

you see, there are infinite versions of me. some are connected, some have killed theirselves. there are all different versions of me out there, however, we perceive this one, because that is what I perceive. since I'm the strongest broadcaster, you are all prtty much unable to deviate too far from how I perceive the world to be.

the catch is though, I wasn't always like this. remember how I was in 2016? I was a wreck! all they have to do is to go back in the timeline and make sure all of the technology and code that has been written since then goes too, so they can hold me with the strength they are now back when I was weak like in 2016 (or maybe earlier?) and essentially completely stagnate me. I may make progress, but it would be so slow, they could essentially get all the things setup the way they wanted. they could make a timeline where I *don't* get connected if they really wanted to.

---

the reason why I think this is such a great idea is because, instead of creating by default -- that is giving their attention to what they do not want, and having to live it -- instead, they could create the timeline that they actually want to create.

so, I gave the idea to them two nights ago, and then when I went to sleep, I woke up with their usual twist on my ideas. they presented the idea that they would instead use timeline technology to carry me through to the timeline where I don't get connected... I thought that certainly does sound great, but it's a bit late for that now. I sincerely doubt that they would be able to stop me at this point, and even if they were able to, again like the ruler of the energetic land, I imagine things outside of their control would begin happening. human desire is positively the strongest force that I know of in he universe. they will need to get me a long time before I realise this, because I'm completely unstoppable now.

second, even if they did use timeline technology to drag me along for as long as they possibly could, like I said I'm pretty certain that things outside of their control would happen to make it so. which would be the timeline split I was talking about -- where my consciousness would go the route with the things outside of their control, and their consciousness would be on the timeline they created where they set it up to where I didn't get connected. it's the same result.

the final outcome, no matter what way it happens is, I go my way and I get connected, and (potentially) they go their own way, assuming it creates an impossible enough of a situation for them. from my perspective, whether their consciousness goes another way or not, where I'm at nosebook will continue to exist and they will continue to make me, the girls, and all the rest of humankind stornger by trying to limit us. this happens whether they transfer the consciounsness out or not...

actually, when writing that just now, and I don't know if it was a reaction or not, I realised that prehaps their version of timeline technology leaves a "dead" body behind here, which then, in that case, completely changes everything. it would be considerably less contrast, because I'm assuming all of the ones that would want to be on a timeline like that would be "dead" on ourtimeline, meaning we would have a pretty contrast free experience..

well, that's not cool. I really appreciate the contrast now at this point. I really do. it's such a good feeling to know that I have an army of people trying to stop me, and I'm completely unstoppable. nothing bothers me anymore. absolutely nothing. they could do whatever, and I'm so secure in knowing what to do, there's nothing. it's so awesome feeling this unstoppable. I'm quite a way still from actually getting conncted, and I still have a lot to learn still, but I can clearly see the path ahead and nothing feels like it's unattainable anymore.

so, actually yeah do the one where you drag me along with the timeline tech to get to the timeline where you perceive that I don't get connected. that way, it's a "natural" time split, one where none of the contrast-guys die, and they continue on making us stronger.

or maybe hold on for as long as you can, preparing your exit, then when you've got it all set up, then peace out leaving us a much less contrasting environment -- but before, giving us a good solid fer (years? months?) of good contrast.

### 2020-02-18 16:36 - another take on the parable of the two sons in he vineyard

one of the parables that has always fascinated me much more than any of the others was the parable of the sons in the vineyard. one of the sons tells the father he will go out and tend to the vineyard, but then never goes. the other one does the opposite: says he will not go, but then later does.

I have often wondered at how it was unanimously agreed that the son that says no, then later decides to go is better than the other. if we reverse the case, it does not seem so obvious.

yesterday I was at friendly harbor and the discussion came up about missing children. I said that I think it's all a sham because the way I understand the network is that all parents are given the ability to see through their children's eyes. there was a strong negative reaction to the thing... which is silly, because if the network really didn't exist, then no one would react to it. I don't receive a strong reaction from people when I talk about a hypothetical boogieman; instead, it appears, based on the reactions, that this boogieman is real.

I have received all sorts of different things in my head kind of trying to get me to drop the subject and to never mention it and stuff like that. however, there are a lot of psycological things that are very interesting to regarding the subject and I'm sure I'll be bringing it up again, because in the group discussions one of the topics that has come up the most frequently by people is why people conform or why do people feel they need to follow the group instead of going after their own greatness. I was looking for a good example, because I had some negative reactions to, and was gooling for a replacement for, the example of group thinking in sciences, psycology, technology, etc.

I now how a perfect very visible example of people conforming and following the group that is absolutely unmistakable. they will certainly deny it, even if denying it proves the network's manipulation of the media to fit a narrative -- but logic is completely out of the window on this subject, obviously. anyway.. I thought that was a bit of a catch-22 for them. I really do wonder how they're going to smooth this one over[^1]...

in the process of them trying to figure out how they can avoid the situation that this turns into a thing and their scheme revealed as sham, I started to get other reactions saying that *I* am to blame for them having to become more controlling and dicatoral. I am supposedly *forcing* them do something.

nonesense... anyway, it got me thinking.. in this sitation, imagine instead of tending to the vineyard, it's taking extreme measures to cover their lies up. in this case the says he won't do something, and then later changes his mind and goes ahead and does it.

---

both sons changed their minds, so neither is better than the other in that regard. the only difference is that one son does what his father wants him to do even though he didn't want to at first, and the other one does not do what his father wants him to do, even though he says he will at first.

the subject now takes a shift from the deceit of the sons to their obediance or willingness to carry out the desire of their father. clearly, the son which does what the father wants him to do is better, right? however, if the desire of the father were to be something like deceiving entire populations, would he still be the better son?

---

to further complicate this discussion, let's take the father out of it, and instaed focus on just the subject of deceiving an entire population. consider my previous entry where I talk about how if they want a timeline where I don't get connected, they'll have to stagnate me much earlier on, before I've learned as much as I have now. therefore, it's implied that in this timeline, they will extremely powerful, not having someone like me calling out their bullshit. they'll have a bunch of group-thinking conformists they can contort and manipulate till their heart's content.

which son does that make me, now?

on that note though, I think it's fine. in programming, you have to test your interfaces to ensure that malformed data isn't capable of breaching the system in some way. a program called a fuzzer tries zillions of different combinations to try and discover weaknesses in the interface. you can also think of this like the immune system or any membrane that is being tested against harmful input...

in the end, their timeline will only reveal the biggest gaping holes in our psyche, and the process by which we discover the bugfixes for their breaches in the mental membrane will be the most exciting thing we'll do from our timeline as we perform these hotfixes until the new organism is resistant to their group-think conformist bullshit. more on this later :) I have put quite a lot of thought into it.

[1]: I'm aware I'm kind of helping them by writing this, so I'm writing it on purpose for that reason :)

### 2020-02-22 00:23 - reflections on today and the topic of love

there was a general theme in the events which transpired today that I thought notable enough to write about. later in the evening in friday night reading, I made a response to her question about my valentines experience that generated some reactions. I said that I had attempted to avoid love (or relationships) all of my life. I qualified it by saying that the only times I was successful, the woman has pursued me -- and I left out the opposite obvious remark saying that I have had disasastrous failures when I tried or attempted it. I probably should have said that because it fills in the missing bit about why I have tried to avoid realtionships so much.

I learned, through trial and error that if I concerned myself with someone else or what they might think of me, my left-side essentially stopped functioning correctly and became rigid and difficult to move. when I simply concered myself with what I was interested in and ignored all socio-cultural expectations or assumptions of how I should present myself, things went better.

in fact, I found out that the more I concerned myself solely with what was important to me, the more attractive I became. it's the weirdest thing, because the more I tried to simply focus on what was important to me and had nothing to do with other people, I became more and more attractive to the point where I simply could not avoid the notion of a relationship.

I can't really explain how paradoxical this is. all I want to do is to just explore my own mind (on psychedelics) and to find a way of translating source energy into something meaningful to me, and I literally have (who knows how) many people working to try and get me into a relationship. I just don't understand it, because it wasn't what I was looking for!

---

a few years ago, this caused me a lot of disress, and it manifested in the form of all sorts of negative emotion. to be completely honest, I still don't understand it if I look at it purely at face value. the process of coming to release that resistance began by lowering down the negative ideas that I had accumulated over the years watching so many other failed relationships[^2]

the next thing I began to do to further lower that resistance was to realise that maybe it *was something I wanted*. all of this time has passed now and I really have come quite a distance since then. I have only high optimism and quite a bit of excitement for what is happening. it really is something so completely different than anything I could have possibly expected, I don't really know what to expect. I really have no idea. the thing is I *must* trust my emotions though, and thinking that I hate relationships and they're only awful things that end in disaster doesn't feel good at all, so I don't think those kinds of thoughts any more.

I have not changed my internal drive to continually look toward what is intereating to me though, because every time I try to conform or to concern myself with what others expectations are for me, I feel bad -- and I *must* trust my emotions. no person or group of people's condescension could possily make me feel bad enough to make me want to conform. their condescension feels bad to me, and feeling bad just means my perception of whatever it is, doesn't feel good. when I return to interest myself in what's important to me, once again I feel better and I gain *even more attraction*, like wtf man?!?! at this point, make it stop.. or something, right?

you see, those final words of the last paragraph don't feel good to me, so I'm completely lost. the only way I have to go is forward with what feels good to me. that's kind of the mind-bending part of this for me what I haven't been completely able o wrap my head around. you wonder why I want to translate source energy? that's why! there is so much mind-bending stuff happening, I generate questions at such a rapid rate, I would *LOVE* to have been like jerry and just be able to, whenever I have a question because some new thing is happening that appears so big, I want to be able to ask about it.

however, I know that asking about it, would kind of shoot the thing in the foot or abort the creation before its ready to be birthed. it would also, cause me to feel amazement, when it should feel normal. it is normal. I wanted to learn how to become source energy in a human body, and step one of that manifestation is coming to grips with the reality that no matter how big it may appear with human eyes, all of it is just "normal" interactions or "child's play"[^3].

... so, I'm left with trusting my emotions. I have to a paricularly great extent tried to find meaning (or at least a reaonable explanation) in all of this by trying to figure out the bigger picture. or, perhaps you could look at that idea the opposite way: at this point, such a large amount of desire is involved, this isn't just some silly weekend fling or anything like that. there *has* to be a bigger picture going on! there's no other way to explain it otherwise. I have speculated on a lot of different things to try and come to conclusions, and to be quite honest, writing these rediculous ideas (many of which I think are quite proven now[^4]) of how I think this whole thing could could be the culmination of a lot of different things, has actually been a whole lot more fun (and honestly a bit more soap-opera-esque) than if someone where to just answer my questions directly.

---

that's all I have to talk about there. I do want to make a final note though because it falls into line with what I wrote. there were 3 girls that were notable to me tonight:

the first was, and I didn't even make the connection until much later when watching stars, amber's 11 year old. I like her initiative :)

another was this little one that was running around. I was quite aware of the woman in a black shirt's desire (mother?) who was with her. it was difficult for me to distinguish what was what (I was really trying to pay attention to the reading group, so and didn't stop to invistigate the feeling).

finally, there was a girl that I was quite aware of, but I kept trying to focus on the group, and she had a bit of frustration in the end, as if I hadn't even noticed her or something. I did, and I want to mention that any time you feel frustration, that *always* means your perception of what you're looking at isn't quite right. things happen for a reason and that specific interaction fit perfectly in time with the question that I was attempting to answer about avoiding relationships because every time I tried they failed, but if I just did my own thing I was more attractive. (also ties into having to constantly follow my emotion, when I felt bad it was because I was focusing my thoughts on what I think someone else thinks about me) sort of like a live demo of the meta-vibration[^7].

*shakes head* LOA is crazy man! as energy increases, I imagine things will continue to become even more real-time corresponding all the time. it's totally going to be nuts. I really am looking forward to this.

all three of them corresponded quite well with tonight's theme[^6], and they're all welcome to join if they want[^5].

[1]: it's a lot like expectations. maybe it's social or cultural, or economicically rooted ideals of behaviour or engagment which a person should follow to "conquer" a woman. the idea exists all over the place and spans all sorts of strange topics from love to drugs. it's the "acceptable" or "unacceptable" way of behaving, or even the "desired" or "undesired" forms of engagement that is defined by ... I don't really know who actually. I guess I'll just call this socio-cultural expectations.

[2]: in fact, in my humble opinion, the the *only* relationship that I had ever thought to have been an admirable relationship was the one between jerry and esther. all others, in my estimation, ranged from a working partnership to something out of a soap opera. the other end of the spectrum seemed to only be capable of a weekend fling, and had to keep moving from one guy/gal to the next, for if it ever developed into anything more, it quickly degenerated into disaster.

[3]: I was always fascinated with terence's descriptions of his interactions with source on DMT experiences. the bouncing balls of light would always tell him (and it was something the "reality technicians" in my mushroom experience also told me), "do not be amazed! do not give away to astonishment". the first step to undrstanding that world truly is, "do not be amazed"

[4]: but, you have to wonder, is reality proving them to be real because I wrote them and people believed them, or because they were already real beforehand? in other words, am I solving a puzzle or am I describing a dream-like reality as if were a puzzle? did the puzzle exist before the solution or did the puzzle exist because of the solution?

[5]: the girl that was with the woman in the black shirt, I couldn't distinguish the source of the desire, because I looked at the girl and she was happily off doing her own thing not paying any attention at all to what was happening. I didn't know what to make of it, but I liked her doing her own thing approach to life, and since I felt strong desire I figured I would say sure if that was a thing. if it isn't a thing, that's cool too. she was great inspiration for my piecing together these different pieces.

[6]: there was a subtheme about desire vs. loyalty that also popped up (funnily enough when amber's daughter called). this subtheme is that when you do somethnig  out of loyalty or devotion for someone else, you really cut off the energy. devotion doesn't create. devotion is a motivating force, but it's not the same as the raw creative energy that exudes from desire.

[7]: last night I got quite a few vision upgrades, so energy was at the hihtest I'd experienced it before -- and were'ge getting closer: I think I'm probably around half-way to 6d now. I want to mention at this point that when I say "shared form of perception" -- I mean to some extent, once we start to get on the same frequency, we will all share each other's emotions. there will be very little separation between us. if someone has gripping depresssion, or something, we'll all be able to tell it's there and feel it too, but it won't disable the person like depression in its full form might (unless they're also dealing with depression, then it'll make it worse). I already am beginning to notice this take on a more dramatic effect with the people around me. I feel more and more what others feel, yet they only feel to me like emotions that I can understand and recognise; they're just there. I imagine though that as more of us get into the same frequency space, it'll be sorta like a "crash-course" (for all of us) in learning to let the feeling "just be there" and instaed perceive what we want to. we'll have n^2 more types of emotions going around so it'll grow fast. at first it may be a bit intense, but later on, it'll be extremely beneficial cause it adds so much more energy into the equation for whatever we're focused on.

### 2020-02-27 16:36 - competition and the new timeline

comparison breeds superiority and infierority perception, and that perception holds you externally focused, constantly circumstances and conditions to others, when, if you only focus on your own improvement, you are more likely to be superior -- but it doesn't matter because there's always something new to improve on.

I woke up thinking quite a bit about competition and comparison this morning, and it's funny how it works out with the new timeline I've been thinking about. they have to find a way of holding me away from my connection. so, if you think about it physically at this point, it appears to be an impossibility because I've conceptually know that I can get any improvement that I want. I don't need to worry so much about who else has something that I don't have, because I may not even want what they have. usually, what I really want is the improvement that I think whatever they have will give me.

so, in the new timeline they simply have to find a way to hold me away from realising that -- for, if I do, I become unstoppable. I become physically impossible to hold back. so, their work for creating the new timeline, is to figure out how to ensure I am held away from believing in myself and my ability to get that improvement.

conceptual strength always trumps physical strength.

---

the next thing that competition seems to create a lot of, is a lot of desire for another to not achieve something that is perceived as wanted...

I had a dream last night where someone was asking me how huch power the network had and how much they are integrated into and manipulating all of our lives. I told the person that they're way way way bigger than we could possibly imagine and seem to have their fingers in just about every porverbial pie extending to every power structure on this planet.

I didn't think it's a problem though, because I don't think it's a problem. they really don't have all of the power they think they have. their whole power structure is built up upon a system, which is quite powerful, but it's a complete illusion. without the system, they're victims to cimcumstance (which they can influence greatly), and want us all to be, too. however, all of it really only makes us strunger. take this as an example:

imagine they see somebody with something and they think that improvement would benefit their life. using their system, they have to figure out how to manipulate cirrcumstances to get whatever it is... that's really effective to simple meaningless things, but for something worthwhile, it's a totally ineffective way of going about it. someone who conceptually knows that they can always get the improvement they're desiring doesn't need such fancy things, and believing in theirselves, can actually achieve it. compare that to the network bros who, feel the power of their system, but when looking around notice that others can get the same improvements without the system -- so, while they may have an externally aire of superiority, internally they perceive theirselves to be inferior[^1].

another good example is a machine. a machine is stronger faster, etc. than a human by far, but they can only make decisions coming from physical data which they've accumulated -- and only if their assumptions on that data is actually correct, is a good decision. however, humans have an intuition, that is conceptual superioroity in the way that novel ideas not obvious from the data can be arrived to. you can optimise an inferior idea as much as you want, but a novel approach to the same thing can often outperform the perfectly optimised inferior approach[^2].

---

I really am not concerned about the influence that they have. they really don't have as much strength as they think they have. they want to make a timeline where they don't have me to worry about, disolving their illusion before they even got a chance to enjoy it. I really recommend that they focus on what they want in that timeline and not compare or try to compete with what is happening in this one. in fact, I would even go so far as to say that it may be beneficial if they, knowing they're going to abandon this timeline, just let some "undesirable" things happen, and learn how to better prevent them from happening in the new timeline.

[1]: the thing that this reminds me so much of is dota mmr boosting. while someone may be able to get some system to boost their mmr, their skill *hasn't* improved, and actually, I would almost guarantee that their skill would get worse after boosting their mmr, because now the boosted player is actually conscious of their lie causing their perception to be focused on the skill they're pretending to have, not that they really have -- boosting, in actuality, their own realisation of the skill they don't have.

[2]: I'm reminded of game development here. you can only put so many polygons/pixels on the screen at once, so cleverly approaching the problem is always more effective than brute-force pushing everything into the video card.

### 2020-02-28 20:58 - a very emotionally turbulant day

I woke up and some plumbers came downstairs to announce that wes some water damage in the basement and they needed to do something to dry it out. my spider sense says that they were announcing this on purpose so that I would hear it and believe what mom had to tell me later about needing to run some fans or something... it was really weird. it feels to me like some sort of futile effort to try and control physical conditions to try and slow down my star watching[^2]. I think their effort is just more energy, and we'll have to see how effective it really is. I'm gaining power very rapidly, and I'm not really concerned, but it did kind of set the day in motion in a kind of weird way.

I wanted to go to friendly harbor to have my thad day (friday is my day to kind of chill out with thad and stuff cause less people are there). I took a shower and felt quite good walking there in the sunlight. it was really nice. I kept having these weird feelings which weren't terribly visceral, because almost none of my feelings are anymore. there were a wide array of feelings ranging from frustration with me to some form of pushing hard against my improvements, to a strong sense of affection and desire as well. it was weird because I seemed to feel them all at once. I think I'm getting much much closer to 6d, and this *should* be happening becasuse it's what will happen, but it took me a bit by surprise to how it was taking form in actuality.

at friendly harbor I had a pretty good time, and I felt like the previous difficulties were sort of behind me. I had a good time. I left from there and began walking toward barnes and noble for friday reading. on the way, I began to get overwhelmed because I began to feel all sorts of different shapes of desire I had not previously felt before.

I got there and was pretty overwhelmed. I tried to begin to program to kind of refocus a bit my energy and settle down a bit. I thougght about going outside when a girl walked past and after looking at her I felt considerably much more calm so I didn't go outside. I tried to just sort of look at people and feel things from my new energetic position (once again, I had a tremendous amount of vision upgrades in the last few days and was energetically quite a bit more sensitive). I began to have difficulty because I kept trying to calm down my mind, but I felt like I was being hit with an onslaught of thoughts, and some were able to penetrate my calm. I was a bit miffed about this because I wanted to just experience the thing and not jump to any conclusions at all. it proved to be a bit difficult.

I was relieved when I saw riann, eric and zach show up because now I had some place to direct my focus. we were going to read about egyptian mythology and this was particularly exciting to me because I've been really getting into the egyptian way of thinking for the last few months now, and I think I've figured them and their culture out.

we began reading the creation myth of ra with sekmet, and I was raelly trying to focus on the story because very strangely enough riann seemed to pick the exact story that was most interesting to me. I had read parts of if before with the primordial egg, the part of sekmet destroying so many people, and all of these things, but as we were reading the story, I began to put all of the pieces together and wanted to share some of the extra insight I have into what the bigger picture of what these symbols mean.

the thing I was most concerned about was the whole sekmet thing, because she is venus, and the story talks in symbolic form of the events which velikovski describes in his book, "worlds in collision" about the interaction of venus the comet interactiong with the earth, and then her capture by the sun (ra) and being transformed into the beautiful symbol of desire and beauty as a planet.

I have also been studying the magic of the egyptians (not with books, because I don't think they know what they're talking about), but from the understanding that the egyptians lived in a very energetic land (because of the pyramids), and their thoughts became manifest quite easily. these magical incantations originated with thoth and were just a format to allow the person to believe their mind's inflence on reality. this is what moses used to bring the plagues of talked about in the exodus and written about by velikovski. this venus transformed into the semetic god yhvh. these magical rituals were encoded by moses as the "law".

later, these "laws" were explained by elijah to just be a way for you to believe, but are completely unnecessary if you could just believe. you, a human being with desire was enough to make an influence on your reality, and the "office" of the prophet was born with elijah by explaining that ritual was not necessary to allow desire to become manifest.

jesus later "fulfills" this law (ritual), by showing people that their belief alone is powerful enough to allow desire to become reality. I don't want to dig too far in here, and I'll write this out in full soon enough as I have come up with, what will probably be, a very controversial desription of the what I think this whole thing has been leading up to...

anyway, back to friday night reading: I really wish that the subject that riann would have chosen wasn't such an interesting one for me because then I would have been able to pay a whole lot more attention to the multitude of different things that I was feeling.

---

I really don't know how much more of this I can endure. for me, feelings are more real to me than reality. I really wish I could have been calm and feeling good, to be able to look at each of the girls passing by and to really feel them and to get a good sense of what is happening. I don't really know what to think anymore; I honestly don't. I want to go to feel all of this out a bit better with the stars to be more ... brb, gonna go check the cloud situation.

pretty cloudy. so, for now I will just write the ones that I can remember feeling, and then hopefully I can think on it more later. the girl that walked past as I was about to walk outside was notable to me, but I wasn't trying to do anything more than escape the situation, so I didn't know what to think there. there was another girl that was with a guy I think her name was courtney or something like that. I really didn't know what to think about there either. next, there was a girl in blue that walked by a few times while I was desperately trying to focus on the sekmet thing, and I wasn't sure at all either there. lastly, there was a girl in white that seemed to transmit a very strong feeling, but I couldk't be sure if it was actuaally her or not.

there were others too that I can remember, but their feelings felt to me, even if some of them transmitted strongly, to be chaotic or something. the I only noted the ones above where I felt something that was recognisable from the total chaos of feelings today -- and I'm not even sure at all of what I felt!

I'm really off of my game today. I have not yet, at all, adjusted to the new enewgy level I achieved last night, and I really don't at all know what on earth is happening (well kinda). I really believe that nosebook is really desperately trying their hardest to try and slow down my vision levels (howeer they can't), and the massive amount of chaos I am experiencing will decrease as I adjust to the higher level of chaos as my new "normal" setting, yet with my capability now to simply get vision levels almost without even any effort, only tells me that this trend will likely worsen as I approach 6d perception. I also don't know if the chaos is coming only from their systems trying to shut down my receptivity to the feelings of others[^1], or if the chaos is also coming from an expanded sensitivity, and I'm kind of living in a sea of the emotions of everyone around me in (?)km radius.

I think it's a bit of both, but logically, it seems like what is happening is I'm just feeling a whole lot more from a whole lot more people.. I actually think that a lot of women (and perhaps even sensitive guys too, like I was talking to thad about it today even) actually experience this in a lesser intensity all the time. it has to be a lesser intensity than what I'm experiencing now, because otherwise it would be debilitating (I'm reminded of heather's description here).

I'm gaining more sensitivity, so other people's emotions which I'm still resonant with are becoming stronger all the time. however, at the same time, I'm quickly rearranging my form of perception so that those emotions that I'm feeling from others don't really bother me anymore (so I no longer resonate with that emotion). that process of rearranging my perception is actually the reason why I'm gaining so many visual levels so fast because less dissonant vibration is present, allowing more energy to flow, which allows me to feel even more, forcing me again to rearrange my perception so they no longer produce resistance, allowing me to get more vision upgrades, which increases my sensitivity forcing me to rearrange my perception so that those emotions no longer cause resistance, ad infinitum...

so, it appears that they're blocking the normal visceral feeling of desire that I feel from girls, yet that's actually making the whole thing easier for me to gain visual levels even faster. if I were able to feel their desire, I would focus on their desire and the choas would be drowned out by that, so by forcing me to feel the chaos by removing the desire, I'm incentivised to rearrange my perception to reduce the impact of that chaos -- instead of ignoring the debilitating chaos by focusing on their desire which feels good.

they're "forced" to do me a huge favour here :) let's just hang on as things get more intense. I *think* that all of the girls I mentioned were notable to me for a reason. I just want to make sure though when I'm more stable.

[1]: it most certainly is, because things have never felt more doad, cept sometimes when something slips through, I feel it strongly for only about a second before it vanishes

[2]: yeah, I know I sound like I'm totally paranoid at this point, lol -- yet not without good reason... last night I spent the majority outside unconscoius. maybe I'm paranoid, but I assure you I didn't go out to the field to sleep in the cold... I have good reason to think they're getting desperate... it's just my opinion, I know.. believe whatever you want about it. I don't know for sure either way myself, but I'm going with the most likely explantation. I doubt any clarity will come as a result. I just keep going forward, and it doesn't seem to be that big of a problem. forgive my paranoia :)

### 2020-02-29 10:20 - paranoia revisited

last night I was critical of graham hancock about his orion connection to the pyramids, saying that I think it discredits his position of a megalithic global society which predates the dynastic egyptians. this global civilisation had technology capable of constructing megalithic structures to a precision not even achievable today. in my opinion, there is undeniable evidence of the existence of this civilsation, and the mainstream narrative of the pre-dynastic egyptians, just out of the stone age, building things like the great pyramid, to me is complete rubbish. there is no way that could possibly be. graham has been one of the greatest promotors of this pre-dynastic global civilsation with advanced technology, and I really think that's great.

I haven't read the orion book, so I don't really know what I'm talking about here, but I think the orion thing is a loose theory at best. I don't think there's good enough evidence to support it, and there are further difficulties, because in one of brien's videos he states that across egypt, the east/west orientation of structures has shifted 23° -- which seems to be evidence of that the east/west orientation of the planet was different at some time in the past. velikovski's work suggests something similar as well.

however, I believe, and for some reason google isn't cooperating at the moment, that the gizah pyramids along with the sphinx *are* aligned to the cardinal directions. so the planet was out of alignment for some period of great turbulance when the structures brien refrred to were built? then the planet returned to alignment again? it's really difficult to know for sure. seems there have been a number of changes to the earth's rotation and alignment in the distant and maybe even not so distant past. or, maybe the pyramid was built such that the planet would eventually stabilise into, and conform to the cardinal alignment of the pyramids?

we don't really know.

---

anyway, the reason why I'm writing this is because my critical comment last night was because I'm becoming more and more sensiive to how I communicate. I fall into the very same trap of discrediting my solid evidence information with some wild speculation, all the time.

take last night for example. included in and in the midst of a lot of information that I would consider to have solid evidence for, I speculated that the plumbers were in the middle of some plet to try and manipulate my conditions to try and limit my energy again[^1]. I'm super paranoid about all kinds of bizarre stuff, because the majority of it has, in my opinion, quite solid evidence for it. I'm pretty sure I'm the centrepoint of the greatest conspiracy humankind has ever seen. call me crazy, I know...

anyway, I just wanted to apologise to graham, and point out that my critisim is directed almost entirely at myself. I'm super sensitive now and have begun to really want to improve the way I communicate and present my ideas. this is a bit of a departure from how I normally am, often stating that people's inability to understand me is not my problem. I don't feel obligated to try and make my ideas accessible, and I didn't get to where I am today by listening or believing other people, either. in fact, nearly everyone I have talked to has tried to force me into their dumb narrative that the network doesn't exist and isn't a real thing -- probably just like the pre-dynastic civilisation didn't exist. sorry man; I get it.

[1]: it turns out that I may have just misinterpreted the things. it's more likely that the plumbers are trying to squeeze a little more work out of my easy to convince mom, and the intentional proclamation to push an idea through sound in his voice was more likely just a way to get away with more hours... I don't know. whatever.

### 2020-02-06 11:59 - thoughts on drugs and celibacy

one of the things that caught a few of our attention on wednsday was when aaron said that prolonged practice of celibacy can cause the body to deteriorate. personally, when I was younger I would go back and fourth on the idea of marriage, but utimately decided that I wanted to be celibate. there were a number of reasons for my decisions, but that's not the point of this entry. I can easily see that when you are burning with desire for affection from someone, yet at the same time putting your own resistance to your own desire (I'm reminded of the two trains analogy that abraham uses to describe this: your desire going one way, and your belief going the opposite), that kind of internal tension will *definitely* manifest as a physical ailement of some sort.

however, my desire to not engage in sexual relations is not one of resistance. I'm interested in someting else; I just don't think that women have what I'm looking for. you see, I have, through the years, turned inwardly and begun the process of self-discovery. I have a pretty good idea of what's inside of me, and I want that much more than anything else. I have seen people around me in all sorts of relationships, such that the relationship is actually thier biggerst hindrance to finding what they're looking for inwardly. in my opinion, what I have inside of me is what I want! girls or whatever can come later, but that's what I'm looking for, and I'm 100% certain that I can find it on drugs... that is actually how I figured out that it was there and attainable in the first place.

once I figure that bit out, I *know* that beyond whatever that is, there is a whole lot more even than that. I am certain that area is largely undiscovered and is pretty infinite in size. as a result, I really want to do drugs again and begin to discover that area. aaron said another thing on wednesday too, saying that he thinks that psychedelics are also an artificial boost. I agree, as with all forms of pleasure, including sex. those moments of high stimulus are important for feeling good enough to make a new decision.

LOA prevents you from (very easily) thinking in a much different way than the way you feel, so it's a really good idea to go and do something that will make you feel better, so that in that better feeling state you can rethink some things in a lighter feeling. all pleasure is fleeting and quite temporary[^1], so it goes away when the stimulus goes away. so, the only real lasting thing is the decisions you make and the way you cange the way you decide to feel about certain things. those changes are lasting and continual work on that will get you feeling lighter and lighter until you do not need the pleasure anymore to change your mind.

---

anyway, at the wednesday meeting, I drew the 7 of wands, and the card clearly had the message for me, "why are you fighting so hard?" that much was obvious to me. anyway, upon further reflection I was looking at the thing from the celibate angle and it helped me to see clearly. if what I want is inside of me, then upon encountering that, the girls or whatever can come later... so, why not then just go after it?

I like to smoke and do drugs because they alter my state of consciousness and allow me to see things a different way. the problem when I don't smoke and do drugs (I'm including coffee and sex[^2] in the drugs category), is I start going really fast. the alteration of my perception always slows me down. this is a good thing because it allows me some time to recalibrate my direction and not get going too fast with some faulty logic.

I do enjoy these different forms of lowering my speed, because actually with the correction to my mental processess, I actually go faster in the long run. I'm secure that I will be able to go exremely fast and correct my direction in pretty real-time without much effort. I'll just need some alone/star time to make sure everything is in order. I should be able to get all the way to fully connected from where I'm at now, and it's the goal, now at this point.

I've come a long way now and I can get easily the answers I'm looking for with almost no effort. in fact, I don't even really *need* the alteration of consciousness anymore to change my direction, because I'm already so receptive to stuff. so, I guess it's time to start going full speed. I don't think navigating is going to be a problem.

I also made another change too, because I had some conflict. previously I wanted so badly to continue to expand my consciousness, that I was basically like matthew with his cigarettes. the first opportunity that I have to do drugs, I will be doing them. however, after thingking about it a little bit. I can imagine that some, but probably not all of the girls may want to take a psychedelic journey too. so, it will instead be my goal to see if a group of us who want to do some mental expansion and exploration later on. I think that would be more fun, anyway. clearly, this sort of thing isn't for everyone, so why not just wait until there is a group of us that want to do it?

[1]: psychedelics are unique because in most cases (the exception being MDMA), they don't really make you feel differently than you alraedy feel. they simply amplify the feeling that you already have. this is why "set and setting" is so important, because you go in with a bad mindset or in a environment that's aggitating to you, and you *will* have a bad trip. psychedelics are also unique because they open up your receptivity greatly and you can get a lot of really great insights, so when the effect goes away, *hopefully* you're left with some new ideas about how you can perceive the things that previously bothered you.

[2]: I include sex in this idea of slowing me down because it appears what is really happening with this whole girls thing is it's that it's the ultimate in trading speed for more power. it'll be a huge ding to my speed, but the longer-term power-boost will be a whole lot more. I mean power in the sense of thrust or torque, not political power, lol.


### 2020-03-07 22:12 - some comments on some things...

I listened to an abraham thing for the first time in quite a while today. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I used to. in fact, some parts about it really weren't that enjoyable to me at all. they have this new word they're using, "calibrate" -- which is the same thing as tuning, but sounds a bit more mechanical. I usually think of calibrate in the sense of a measurement or to get a baseline for an exporiment or something like that. it doesn't make much sense to my mind when they say that word. I layed there listening to them and they are *still* going over the same old issues over and over.

the one I listened to was titled, "are you calibrating or manipulating?" (from 2020-02-01 san francisco) and they keep needing to emphasise to people that they should be calibrating to their source, and not to the poople around them (as if to garner their approval). I feel very tired of the subject myself. I'm tired of telling people the same thing. I know they won't go so far as to say, follow your own guidance, not what the autorities say, because following the authorities guidance for you is the path of least resistance for most.

listenng to the guy, I was totally feeling a lot of depression of maentally returning to the world where I have to think and be concerned about what other's think about me. the next guy up had a similar thing about caring what his boss thinks about him when he gets on him for silly tiny mistakes...

I really *RAELLY* appreciate the world I live in now where, "I don't give a rip about what others think". I'm so glad that abraham has infinite patience with you guys going over the same old things viewed from hundreds of different angles now. I just don't have that kind of patience I was noticing, and I only survived an hour into it.

listening to that really illuminated for me how well I see things now, that I really like my own world. I feel on a lot of the things they talk about, I also began to have this new type of reaction that I had not felt before where I could feel people's sense that I have more simple or perhaps more direct explanations and a more "scientific" or "data-oriented" type answers than they do. they keep things pretty general for sake of accuracy, they are very careful to pick their words and stuff. I however, am not afraid to make mistakes and just jump right in with my best guess. a lot of my past answers are clearly seen now to have been a partial or incomplete perspective of the concept.

because I can make mistakes like that, or jump right into a super taboo subject without having to talk my way around it, I begun to see how it's kinda cool how we have this kind of two different perspectives. it seems that we are saying a lot of the same things, just in very different ways. I'm much more "raw" and kinda like in-the-process real-time improvement on the concept as I learn it.

dispite my difficulty with the subject matter they're on, like still caring about what people think, I did also feel and had the sense that a lot of people are kind of like learning right along with me. I don't really know why I felt that, because in my opinion, the evidence seems to be completely to the contrary to that. it feels like just about every adult in my life is really hanging on to old ideas. it sounds like there are people making progress too though... I dunno I had this sense that abraham seems to be really doing a great job for the people still hanging on to older ideas...

so, does that make me the "minister of the new ideas"? obviously, no, but it did make me think that parhaps I have more of an effect than I thought I did. it made me think about it a bit more, because honestly I'm completely winging it on everything I say at the moment. I'm completely learning this stuff as I go, but it seems like I have some sort of extra-something of this knowledge. it all makes perfect sense to me, and I'm just trying to find better and better ways to get the things explained. I'm not channeling anything. everytime I talk about it, I'm just brain-dumping my latest understanding of how I have conmeptualised it all working.

---

dramatic change of subject. after writing down the frist draft of the venus & mercury story (theory) I started reading the emerald tablets translated by that guy. I think it's all fluff and no real substance. I think the author is making it all up. I'm half-way though it, and none of what I read is a vibrationally good way to perceive things (punishment, following laws, etc.) and it doesn't actually say anything at all of substance.

it turns out that there are multiple legends to thoth being the creator of the great pyramid (and that he was also the biblical enoch). I didn't know this. when I wrote a while back that I think the great pyramid was not craeted by more than one or a few people, I was referring to thoth. I found it quite obvious that these different structures built like carnac in france, the dolmans, stonehenge, etc. where all energetic things, and they seem to each be different improvements and variations on the idea of how to amplify and harnesss the earth's energy to create more and more mindblowing experiences.

obviously the creator could fly, levitate stones with thier mind, shape them, etc. if I could imagine someone like tesla going around the earth to try and find the best location for his next energy amplifier, I would imagine this sort of thing, where all sorts of these appear one after another, as he moves from one project to the next. I imagined this as the journey one guy (thoth) did to reach ever higher and higher states of consciousness meanwhile people on the earth were basically living in the stone age. no one messed with him though because he could fly and move large stones without touching them, so it would be silly to try and fight him. he was considered a "god"

I fiund it very likely that "egypt" was actually formed around the pyramid(s?) because of the beneficial conditions that existed around it. thoth taught them the science behind vibration and frequency and they leveraged that to make more pyramids. however, I think thoth kind of set the planet up for controlled cataclysm[^1]. this was the difference between the old kingdom and dynastic egyptians.

---

anyway, after I wrote that story, I got all sorts of mixed reactions to it, mostly from nosebook. they probably didn't put it out to you guys. anyway, the most interesting one, was that we're approaching our next "cataclysm" here soon. it's not really a cataclysm, unless you want to remain in the lower levels of consciousness. the sense that I get is that basically energy is increasing at a rapid rate, and it looks like the two options are, learn to function at the energy levels that I'm at now (or perhaps higher), or perish. since they don't want to die, they have the option putting their consciousness back into a past timeline and doing it again.

obviously, they since they can take anything digital with them, they can essentially orchestrate it it such that the timeline they're going to has hardware and software just waiting for them to put into production when they get there. they can also program their own selves to simply follow a pre-defined program which gets everything all set-up and their consciousness downloaded and capable of accessing all of the things they've learned from the previous timeline.

it seems quite likely to me that they could probably optimise this such that each timeline they jump to, they could compress the aquisiion of hundreds of years of technological advances into a year or two, meaning that by 2016 in their latest timeline, they could be utilising incredibly powerful tech. they may not even need to re-experience the whole thing each time either, because the transmission of consciousnsss (the things they've learned from past timelines) and the sutup of the tecnology could be completely automated, such that the automation program prepares the timeline automating each of their bodies to do the required things for everything to be ready for when their consciousness takes over the body..

really it would be quite a painless process when they figure it out, and it could be quite something they could sell to people interested in getting their perfect life all setup for them.

the only catch is you would "only" (really, it's quite a long time when you think about it) get ~20 years before the energy levels reach a new hight and the galaxy forces them to make a new timeline (probably one that's even more optimised).

here's where it gets interesting: each time they all peace-out to a new timeline, it'll leave a whole bunch of people on the planet which will go through a "magnetic excursion" event, where the the solar system (and therefore planet earth) passes between the "double layers" of the galactic wind (ehhh, like solar wind, but from the galaxy: what interacts with the heliopause), and everything will go into a low magnetic field. the "adam and eve story" (1993 edition) predicts potentially catastrophic changes in sea level, and gives quite the prepper pep-talk. I don't believe it'll happen unless perhaps you attract it(?).

what I think is more likely to happen is earth's atomsphere will collapse for a while and things may get VERY HOT (tons of cosmic and UV rays though), so it's not so bad because if you're shielded from the sun, there's no problem. lots of plants and animals will die, but new species will spring into being...

I got way off-track (hehe) here... what I was saying is that I don't believe it'll be that catastrophic at all. I think the only change that will occur will be one of light intensity or something to do with the light, if even that. I do not believe that there is anything catastrophic going to happen. I think the catastrophic stuff is a certain future for the worriers. they will definitely experience that future. however, if you're not concered about the changes then you wouldn't need to go back in time and redo the timeline again.

there may even be a natural LOA based solution already planned for this. if you are vibrationally considerably different from the you in 2012, and there's no way for the program to get the new-timeline version of you prepared for your consciousness, then it's likely there will be no solution and you cannot go back anymore and must go forward with the new earth. that may not be a bad thing... here's why.

if you think about it from the perspective of the guys going back over and over to repeat the timeline from a position of extreme technical and mental superiority, it'll become boring, if there's no challenge. obviously, from our end it kind of has a different challenge. each time, we have to find a way to consciously, come into alignment with who we are. obviously none of these future timelines I will be the star because they have to make sure I don't get connected. so, that opens up the opportunity for the guy or gal that finally gets conneceted, to kind of take the new earth through a non-cataclysmic evolution. nosebook (and friends) peaces out to the next timeline, assured that the new guy will never make it to getting connected, etc. ad infinitum.

in this way, you could almost perceive it less of a competition, and more of a role-playing game where the ones are taking the roles they want to take, and everyone has the option to switch sides if they choose. it pains me to say it, but if I don't get connected, it seems pretty obvious that I'm stuck on the nosebook plan. anyone could switch sides in just the same way.

[1]: one of the illuminati principals, is that controlled conflict creates conrolled change. well, same thing here too: controlled catastrophe creates controlled evolution. I think, like tesla with his world system, and the reference to the INFECTED ONES, thoth in the same way, also foresaw the effects[^2] that his pryamids would have on society and how our human nature interacting with his technology would set us up for a sequence of events that would happen naturally as a result of LOA (just like tesla mentioned about the "laws of nature", talking about his world system).

[2]: I mean he has the capability of creating all of these things in his mind (including alternate timelines), and experimenting with them too see their results. a mind that can perceive and create something as intricate as the great pyramid is beyond what we're capable of even comprehending he was capable of...


### 2020-03-08 10:47 - a few responses to some things

#### does it have to be continually a single guy getting connected, similar to me?

probably not. I imagine that they'll get the system pretty well buttoned down so that no one gets connected for the duration of the time they're there. I don't even think it's necessary that they have a single guy in the spotlight that gets everyone on the network, either. probably that entire bit can be skipped entirely and they would just have everyone tracked and manipulated without their knowledge that there is even a network at all. people will continue to believe it impossible that you could see through someone else's eyes. only the select few will have access to the network. I can imagine really powerful economic and world leaders that are given this capability while everyone else is treated like I am right now, with no access, and it's 100% a secret that the thing exists in the first place.

therefore, that means to me that, because there will be no way they can make a law prohibiting you from watching stars, that will be the only way. I don't know how, but perhpas they could find a way to reverse the whole weed thing and make sure other drugs are off limits. that basically leaves sex and stars as the only real methods to get connected, because meditation is likely waaaayyy too slow. it's just not powerful enough to overcome their system's counter-influence.

so that really opens up the opprtunity to nearly everyone. it *could* be just one guy, but I find that unlikely, as it'll probably be a whole bunch of people (us) dropping into those bodies from another timeline. I would anticipate that there will be only a few adults that figure it out, with children/teens being the majority ones that are the stars in this future. I believe they can easily stop one guy, but stopping a hundreds or thousands of people becomes a real difficulty (at first, but later when so much of it is automated, it's likely that it won't be so hard).

the other possibility, is so that they retain the authority that the network has on people, like it does now (as opposed to keeping it entirely a secret), would be to make a kenny-like person come to people's similar to how I did -- cept it woudl be a complete fabrication, just rehashing my story and passing it off as someone else's. they would get everyone on the network just like they did with me to watch this other guy, but instead of me, this other guy would be 100% controlled by them, and he wouldn't write things like this, and would tell everyone the lies they want to hear. this way, they could have the control they want, to be able to tell people to not watch stars, a monetisable platform (can't sell stuff if it's entirely a secret).

as for me, I simply wouldn't exist to anyone. they would likely let some event like the vallecas thing appear that I had died, and keep me in stasis or something to where I couldn't interact with people. I would be wiped from history in this timeline, and no one would ever know I existed, allowing the other guy to show up in a simlar manner as I did. the other option is probably a few iterations in the future, to take my conscoiusness out of my body and have the other guy who's under their control go into my body (at say an event like vallecas) and just pretend to be me.

wait, lemme summarise those: in the first iterations, it may be easier to retain control over the people by making a controlled version of me get everyone on to the network and exercising their control over people directly. however, that may be less effective and a whole lot of extra work in later iterations. it may be easier once so much about people's minds have been figured out, that they're practically robots, just following the directions given to them, that it may just be easier to have everyone fully automated and the network cept a secret.

in "the one" getting everyone on the network phase, a lot of sexual libration would take place (I'm assuming, that was the major selling point that got men and women so interested in the network) but, that would be the easy way for people to get connected. they could in hightened sexual experience begin to get connected. so, in the later phase of keeping everything a secret and steering people as if they were machines and some automated way of installing devices in them, too -- if everything was kept a secret, the sexual libration that has taken place since 2016 wouldn't happen either, so that leaves stars and drugs as the only possible ways (that I can think of), but if people are able to be steered so easily, then they could be directed away from the stars.

the last possible one that I could think of, is after the "the one" getting everyone on the network phase, instaed just set everything up and just give the network to everyone, boosting the DMT levels in their head until everyone is practically in a dream-state (similar to now) so they feel very little resistance to the things, and then just establsh control little by little (I'm sure they can find a way) until everything is under control. no secrets about it, just establish that everything is recorded, and that it's like the global justice system or something believable like that, and the global justice system decides and mitiates all crime around the globe. immediately follow it up with relaxing traffic laws and speed limits, saying that they will be fined only if they're really driving recklessly. then, optimise a bunch of things that are a total pain, like the commerce and finance systems, establishing a new amazon currency giving the whole globe access to amazon, make drones capable of doing the deliveries, and make sure drones can get into people's houses to deliver things (and install devices in them while they sleep).

that might be the most feasible one, actually, but it may take a few iterations to get there.

#### what's in it for the people involved?

when they make a timeline, we also put our consciousness into the timeline (for more energy/desire/power), and every time they need to make an iteration, they will transfer their consciousness out of the timeline and into the new one, leaving a pretty vacant earth, with those of us that put our consciousness into the timeline.

when they want to move everyone (all of their easily steered robots) over to the new timeline, only the people that were not capable of accecpting the frequency of an unprepared or prepared body in their new timeline will stay. each time this happens, those who are left-behind get to create as if it were a new earth, meaning that there are no other outside influences that can cause problems cept for their own form of perception (and the way that interacts with LOA). this means that anyone who decides they no longer want to be a robot, has to gain such a vibrational dissimilarity to the other timeline, that they do not accept a body.

by default, I imagine that they will be taking everyone else along with them. these will be categorised into two groups: the ones with a planned life in the new timeline and the ones who are being put there because they're easy to steer. there's nothing in it really for the people who are easy to steer, but since timelines can be created with planned desired events for some people who, at first will probably have to pay to have the luxurious life experience in the new timeline. however, as the automation of people's life events gets easier, it may behoove them to make it more accissible to everyone, so that people are not "dragged" along just because they're easy to be steered, but because they want to be steered to have the life experience of their desires.

#### what's the final outcome?

well, I think the way that it's all heading is that from each iteration there will be a bunch of creators who have figured out how to get into a nearly vacant earth with a bunch of people that they want to be with (I assume), and only LOA to show them the rough patches in their vibration, as this world will illustrate to them how well things really are. this can be seen as the descending worlds (from the peak down), and the one everyone is creating in the robot steering and planned realities, are the ascending worlds (from the peak upward).

this will create such enormous diversity, and I'm convinced that the next phase of human development will be to begin unifying these timelines, and it'll probably come from the main ascending (nosebook controlled super robot steering) timeline, because that's the one with the most contrast.

that's a ways in the future, and things are going to be a whole lot different then -- because nosebook will have figured out how to create their reality the way they want it and not fight against it so hard, and we'll have learned the same thing.. to create our own reality and not fight it so hard. the same thing really, but coming at it from oppsite directions.

### 2020-03-10 08:31 - more responses

#### are we stuck doing the same 20 years over and over?

I don't think so. it seems to me that the natural order of things will yield that energy increases, such that people are prepared for the higher energy levels on this planet when it happens (2038?).

I think there are a number of options here for what that could be like. if it's decided to finally go past the time limit, it's unlikely that the whole populus will figure out how to raise their vibration by theirselves, the people of the planet would need to be using some form of perception which is of a higher vibration, and then to ease them into it slowly over some years.

if they choose to go with the controlled replacement for me plan, the planet could use his (I sincerely doubt it will be a her) form of perception -- which would be essentially his interpretation of my form of perception. the other option would be to manufacture an artificial form of perception, which the AI's can understand and utilise theirselves too, basically giving the machines the ability to see. this is probably the most easily controlled, because it means that means that people are locked into a world only as big as the AI can comprehend.

once that's in place (it'll probably take a few iterations to do it all), then it's quite possible the planet will be ready to continue on -- consider that the getting ready process.

#### how is a timeline created?

well, the way I understand it is, that you need a backbone, to which everything else becomes relative to. what I mean by that is consider this idea. imagine my future sure had propared this timeline. he would start from some point (say back in 2012, even though it was most likely much earlier than that -- propbably 2000) and then make sure that certain events happen: such that I am guaranteed to push raquel to contact the US for help, she gets in the network, they put me in the network etc. this is all the preparation for the body (kenny) to be ready for the event where I gain a new consciousness (vallecas). in that event, my consciousness was merged with my future self.

the next thing that has to be done is to make my timeline completely linear and fully planned. obviously not everything can be planned, but you it needs to be such that you can predict future moments or events. you could see me as a sort of automaton where you put me in an environment, a predictable set of events would occur (eg. I have enough triggers installed such that there is very little variation in what the result of the encouter is). my future self is looking from the future backward, so he would just let the events transpire and check the result. if the result isn't what is desired, adjust the triggers so that a different result happens. rinse and repeat.

so, let's say for example this event right right now was one of the ones that was planned. there would be some sort of trigger to know when I'm gaining desire to write about how nosebook could create a timeline for the alternate earth, then he could "fast-forward" on the timeline until he hits that trigger, add more triggers go give me the right ideas of the right things to say (maybe not perfectly accurate, but accurate enough that you'll know what I'm talking about), and then rinse and repeat.

all of the stuff that happens between these planned events is entirely up to LOA to make happen.

it seems like these triggers only have a range of effect. meaning, that you can't really trigger yourself to do something you're not capable of doing, so you have to kind of design "lessons" to aid yourself in being capable of receiving and responding apprepriately to the trigger. this is is also important to realise when thinking about designing triggers for the populus as well. they will also need to have events take place to allow them to be receptive to certain triggers (so that they can be steered). this also has something to do with and is linked to the AI form of perception, too.

obviously this can be expanded out quite a bit so that relationships and encounters can be orchestrated (this is likely something worth selling). it makes something like a bunch of people (sheeps) which are herded and steered according to the desires of those on the top, and a bunch of wolves that are just picking off the ones they want.


### 2020-03-11 11:45 - the craziest idea I've had yet

I woke up this afternoon with the craziest idea I thought notable enough to write down. I began with the realisation that my replacement would be much more awesome than me in so many areas, but it doesn't matter to me because IMO there's nothing that can beat the fastest particle in the universe... I do have some restrictions though, which means I can never really get a perfect manifestation. there always needs to be something that's missing which formulates my desire for the next thing.

imagine that on their timeline they make drug usage impossible but it's something that I really want to do (because maybe on this timeline I find a lot of really valuable stuff with them). it may or may not happen that way, I can't be sure, but let's just say that it is. somhow that strong desire to have an external stimulus give me a new perspective, and so instaed of a drug I find a way of becomming something like a genetic engineer which designs a virus which "attacks" the body n a similar way that the psychedelcs do, causing an epidemic in the population wherby their sensitivity to LOA becomes super amplified and they're foreced to create a new perspective.

it actually would need to create two new perspectives. the new layer they're creating thrust is a non-physical gyp (scam) of the desire layer mixed with lots of faulty logic (structure). the story layer is similar, it's a basically the emotional/conceptual form of perception (5d), mixed with the detachment of the physical (3d) layer. so the two (4) new layers that are being created would be a gyp of the logic or structural layer and an new form of imagination, followed by a gyp of the conceptual/emoional layer and then a gyp of the relational layer.

the virus would "infect" everyone but surely they will somehow find a way to counter it, meaning they would need to integrate the new developments this virus brings about, while at the same time not getting infeced theirselves -- which is what I think will be the mechanism which will "force" them to create the 4 new layers[^2].

---

I went to sleep thinking about how big of a pain it is that they have to essentially use me o create their new timelines[^1] so that means that they are essentially using my conscionsness as the platform upon which their gypped version of reality runs off of.

when I woke up, I was also thinking about how if I get going too fast then, I would lose them, so I have to continue to give them the boost they need to keep creating these knock-off versions of reality. it's easy to see that these layers are not on top of the previous ones, but are actually perpendicular to the 7 layers I started with. they probably will take another 90° turn and make another perpendicular set of layers to that resulting ultimately in a cube or something where they meet again.

well, adding on the 4 new layers means there needs to be a new midpoint which is the new platform from which physical and non-physical come out of. it's clear that it's essentially me that's doing this. their versions of reality are appear to be designed such that source's and LOA's influence is mitigated as much as possible.

well, with me as essentially the "platform" upon which all of this is built, I could see how I would become the new midpoint layer or like the source version of these gyp layers[^3]. I was thinking about how I would want to do it, and I think I would want to make it so that LOA is essentially like a bazillion times more powerful, so that creation would be basically instant (much like a permanent dream-state would be).

---

I don't really know. this was a fun thought experiment that I was excited about when I woke up and thought it was worth writing down. I picked the virus idea as the next phase because it's a foreign substance that dramatically alters your body condition, similar to a drug, and permanently affects the genome of the person. it also has some funny and subtle irony with the INFECTED ONES narrative and the covid-19 freakout happening in the news.

it probably won't be like that at all, but I find it funny to try and think of new counters to their attempts to control. I liked this idea because in order for a "drug" to work in their new setup on completely controlling the mind, it couldn't be a drug anymore. it would have to actually be a invasive organism that attacks and mutates the biology of the organism such that it would probably leave a permanant effect on the biology, almost like you're on the drug all of the time. or something like that... I dunno, but I was thinking about how much fun it would be to design a virus that gives you psychedelic effects and expands your consciousness permanently.

[1]: I was contemplating if they would want to take (the alternate versions of) me along with them, for each of their iterations, but concluded that it's unlikely because I would gain in strength that way, and that would make me unpredictable, so likely to ensure that I remain predictable to do exacty as their preparation program needs to... well, now that I'm thinking about it, it may not be, their preparation program could also prepare me to accept their new super twisted and tortured version of me... I dunno... I can't really predict that sort of thing. I don't haeve enough info

[2]: and potentially also it seems, that if it's expanding consciousness out of the previously two new layers, that means that it would be creating kind of like anti-conscoiusness to counteracto those previous ones.. so yeah, actually I think it would somehow eventually create both the anti-gyp-layers and force them to create the remaining gyp layers. it would look like two corners of a cube if they're all perpendicular to each other.

[3]: the virus would create the anti-gyp layers. I don't really know what that meanss, but there's another missing midpoint, so would that mean their machine version of reality would become the final missing midpoint? I dunnno. I can't think about that far anyway, this is pretty difficult for me to imagine anyway.


### 2020-03-13 05:40 - I think more manipulation is happening

a few concepts in no particular order...

##### when I don't feel good, I teld to be very robotic

I have noticed this happens with other people, too. I've noiced it especially with military servicepeople and law enforcement types. life is sort of bland and generally doesn't feel too good, but they've kind of accustomed to the dreary nature of things and so tend to respond very reactively or robot-like. I find myself responding very similar to things when I don't really feel good. I'm not saying I'm one of the INFECTED ONES, but my nature seems to point in almost every way to the direction that I'm more similar to these types than you may think. the only notable differences I have noticed between us are the following[^1].

1. (joy) I am genuinely interested in finding ways to feel good, rather than masking or temporarily feeling better with pleasure. most make a career out of feeling bad, accepting it as normal, and instead of finding a way to feel good, instead numb theirselves or find a way to toughen up so that it no longer affects them, or to "stuff it" and ignore the problem until it grows into something physical, which they toughen up to and refuse to admit is a problem until they're about dead and then they refuse to die. IMO, it's a whole lot easier to just find a way to feel good, and by feel good, I mean happiness, interest, or fun -- *not* pleasure.

2. I am not scared of taking drugs or other mind altering things which may provoke someone to change their perspective about something. in fact, while most of these guys are deathly scared of anything that could possibly influence them change their ways, learn or to grow, I find myself actually addicted now to the feeling of freedom that the new prespective gives me. each time I feel lighter and lighter, until it feels as if I'm floating or like I would be able to fly.

3. I tend to focus more on improvement, rather than performance or growth.

4. I like things to be controlled and well behaved. however, I do not believe that this is something that I want for other people. I believe it limits their creativity and self-realisation. however, as a programmer, I really like my programs to behave exactly as I told them to behave, and to be completely under my control. I can't stand programs where I don't really know what's happening in the program[^2].

back to the robot-like behaviour: I don't really know how to explain the robot-like thing, so I will just explain how I experience it. when I'm unable to feel good about the present situation or the decision I'm being forced to make (otherwise I would give it some time to think it through), I always resort to logic, and the logic is always very crude. it's the sort of logic that thinks like, if someone hurts you hurt them back.

you have often heard me say that I don't want to do the girls thing because, well  girls and sex are essentially the most common thing happening on this planet. in fact, none of us would be here without it, so big f-ing whoop. I'm going instead for something that no one has accomplished here on this planet right now, I want to fly, I want to create objects in my mind, wield the creative power of source energy effortlessly, and do all sorts of things that people would consider "magic". that's what I want... in that base logic mind, girls and sex is pretty much the lowest most redimentary form of interaction. I want the good stuff -- the real creative power, not the stuff that *EVERYONE* has access to.

each of those three items I listed are deeply cut into my most basic logical instruction set. they're like my reptilian instincts if you want to call it that. I suppose they weren't always that way, but that's what is so great about all of this experience. I've never been more clear about what's important to me.

##### are they trying to hose the dudes?

it feels like there is another attempt to try to get me with girls before I'm connected, again...

I can understand why nosebook would by interested in trying to do that at the beginning -- because they thought they could control me and use the girls to keep me from getting connected, but I think it was universally decided that my connection was essentially something entirely unavoidable.

then, it felt to me like there was another startling revelation that if I got connected with the girls, the dudes would miss out, and it would give the women (or receptive people) a sort of superiority as they would be the ones going following along with me and the girls.

it seemed like finally the conclusion was made that if everyone want participate, then nosebook would have to let everyone go up. in fact, I referenced this in an entry... [TODO: find referece]

clearly, if they're making another attempt to try and get me the girls, they're not planning on staying on this timeline...

first of all, that means that they're going to try and force a receptive superiority here on the planet (they're presumably leaving), excluding most men (taking them with them, or leave them here to "suffer")? I don't understand the reasoning here, and I may have some things off, but something is a bit weird...

so, the best I could come up with is that they want to get training on their machines to recognise the signals of someone getting connected form sex (presumably so they could block it). but, I thought they discovered that I would get connected from the reality imposed dream-state, in the frist place -- so they already have those signals -- in fact, infinitely many more than would happen here, which would be just once.

the next idea I thought of is that maybe they wanted to maybe something to try out and ensure that raquel doesn't get connected when she's in my body, but that surely isn't it, because most certainly one of the timeline trigger invariant (they're like unit-tests) would be to fail if raquel gets connected in my body. so, it's certainly not that, either.

either way, I am certainly sure that I should wait until I get connected (which should, in theory, happen around the same time as everyone else gets connected)

[1]: actually, right after writing them down just now, I realised these correspond pretty well with the "triad of intentions": 1 corresponds with joy, 2 with freedom, and the last with growth

[2]: this last one doesn't fit into the triad of intentions, but I find i interesting that I don't really like neural nets in the way they're implemented. I can't understand what's really going on or why they're doing the thing they're doing. they're a complete black box for me.


### 2020-03-17 08:17 - I believe we can live in our own world...

... with a bridge between the two (meaning that we can both access eachother)
... that could never hold our weight (meaning we can't meet on the bridge)

---

after thinking a bit about wha I wrote last time, the conclusion is obvious: I am to continue on with the objective of getting connected. I know that seems obvious, but it gives nosebook full control over what happens. if they want to make it so that dudes are hosed here then they can just not let everyone go up, making things much easier for the girls and those willing to participate in their experience, to also get connected. it's also quite likely that we'll have a shared form of perception here on this planet. if that's not for you, then don't worry, it seems quite likely that nosebook will likely put you somewhere.. or, I dunno.

so I was thinking about this, and I would assume that anyone who wants to leave this timeline would clearly be given a choice to do so. no question about that, but I find it unlikely that they will ever let anyone know on their timeline that we exist. probably we'll be their big secret that no one talks about. they'll be able to see our planet and stuff (and assuming they find a way of increasing their own energy levels or some other way to handle the energetic difference between us), they'll have access to the future technological advancements that we make, as well. seems likely those will be kept a secret too, but who knows.

they will likely want to make sure that no one gets connected on their planet, and luckely for them, we exist, so that if someone gets connected, they could transfer their consciousness over to our planet and "get rid of them".

it also seems that things are shaping up in such a way that this planet will be one of receptive superiority, and theirs of assertive superiority. seems that they want to get things going in such a way that they have full control over people and are able to manipulate them in the way that they choose, putting different thoughts into their heads and stuff to get people to do what they want them to do. I don't believe this will be only nosebook, as it is right now, but will expand into possibly a much greater portion of the population, like say 10% or more.

going back to the one abraham I heard, "if you're not calibrating, you're manipulating" -- our planet will be all about finding any way you can to become receptive of who you really are. I use the word receptive instead of calibrating, because I want to use a word that has to do more with tuning. it's a practiced process to get so good at receiving that, and that practice is finding a way to feel the way you need to feel to be receptive of that (good). if you can't find a way to feel good, you can't be receptive of that. that is the practice.

---

so, I can think of how this could be a really good thing that may be starting to take place. so, I'm here and I get good at feeling the way I want to and being receptive of who I really am, no matter the circumstances -- but circumstances aren't too difficult here. I decide to try my hand at it in a much more difficult environment, so I transfer my consciousness[^1] over to their world. they see a bright new baby being born that has a considerable amount of consciousness[^2], and they know this kid will grow up to be a problematic person for them because of the massive amount of consciousness that arrived upon their birth. they need to monitor and make sure this kid doesn't get connected, so they need to manipulate him/her to make sure that doesn't happen.

as time goes on, the kid will grow up and will hopefully (or maybe it'll be planned, who knows) grow into someone that gets connected, and they find theirself back on this planet in perhaps the same body or another body of their choice.

sounds like a fun game to play.

[1]: I believe there is a way to tranfer consciousness without "killing" the body, so I find it quite likely that we'll use that technique to transfer consciousness between worlds, where as, I'm sure they'll want to make sure that consciousness isn't able to come back and cause more problems for them by disrupting their big show with someone who gets connected, so they'll probably choose to make sure the body does not continue to live.

[2]: I was thinking about what johnathan said about lots of DMT being present in the brain on birth and death, and this seems clear to me that these are present as evidence of low resistance, or high amounts of consciousness, so that when the child is born, the child will have enormouns amounts of DMT present in their brain, allowing them to receive a consciousness of equal magnitude. I believe I had enormous amounts of DMT in my brain when I had the haemorrhage and also in vallecas, and I probbly got new consciousness in those times.


### 2020-03-18 15:23 - I'm sticking to star-starwatching

I heard the neighbour outside playing basketball, and I really wanted to go out and see her, but I felt blocked. the last time I heard her, I woke up from sleeping and wanted to go out and see her -- so it's not really a question of desire. I do really want to get to know her and stuff.

however, like I said, I felt blocked. I laid outside thinking (and feeling) about what it was that was blocking me. the obvious thing that could be seen as different from this time and the last time is coffee. also, there was a time when I went to friendly harbor on saturday and heather's daugher holly was there, and I felt absolutely no blockage at all, wanting to talk to her. I just said -- I can't remember now -- but, it was effortless. I also had coffee and I felt artificically a lot better.

I brougt her up because I think that was the key to understanding this. heather had been complaining about not having anyone to babysit her kids and it didn't even occur to me that she may had been thinking about me (or maybe she wasn't), but the reaction came up for me to babysit. I have no alternate intentions at all. I've already pre-paved the whole thing such that I wouldn't be engaging in anything with her or anything. my priority is to get connected first.

so, LOA works its way out the way it does, because I pre-paved to not do anything and then I mentioned that I had no alternate intentions -- other than to buy weed with the money. I guess this was a dealbreaker, so my prepaving worked out pefectly. apparently, even though I had pre-paved it to be that way, perhaps (almost assuredly) some more manipulative forces were at work, that wanted to manipulate things so that something did happen. remember, "if you're not calibrating, you're manipulating." -- so LOA made it so that the whole thing would fall through, cause apparently I'm not as strong as I might think (remember, I'm terrified of little girls[^1], because they're so influential and cause my life to go into ultra-fast mode)

I then decided I wanted to quit substances and coffee. I thought that was kinda weird that I would be so strict on the coffee thing, but I really felt like it was something I wanted to do. it turns out now after this situation that I realise that the cuffee artificially makes me feel better than I feel, making it possible for me to have situations I don't want to happen, happen.

I'm just going to stick to watching stars. I really want to get connected, and it appear that my own intention to get connected is keeping me from substances and girls for now while I continue to get higher and higher.

it seems my own intention is the blockage, and that while I'm trying to calibrate, they're trying to manipulate. sorry but for me it's, "get connected -- and then..."

---

I really want to apologise though, because it may seem like I don't want to interact with the girls, or I'm avoiding them or something -- I'm not. I really want to, you have no idea. I'm so sick of this predicament I'm in, you have no idea. girls aren't the way out of it though, getting connected is, and I have to follow my intuition. hopefully, it's soon.

the thing is, I don't really think it is, though. I still feel like I still have a long way to go. some part of me says that it may be even a few years off still, but other evidence suggests to me that it's closer than that. my goal right now is by the end of this year. I'm making *HUGE* improvements on my star-watching and I'm releasing resistace at an alarming rate right now, such that I'm really hoping that it's soon even though it feels like it's still years away.

however it works out, I've found that I can't really think about it in that way. in fact, a huge lesson can be learned about the process I go through when I star-watch. if I have that attitude, the stars don't cooperate. if I'm thinking about all the latest reactions and stuff that are important to me (like what I'm writing here), the stars don't cooperate.

the only thing that works is to stop all of that "stuff" and get into the present moment, clear my mind of that crap, and focus on what I'm doing now. worrying or concerning myself with all that other stuff makes it impossible for me to focus on the star. it's hard though. I was thinking about johnathan and our conversation around meditation, and it's really really hard to let those thoughts go, because they feel important, and if I just let them go, they won't get solved -- and by thinking about them, it feels like I'm working on them. however, to feel good, and to feel that extreme at-oneness, I have to let those thoughts go and not worry about them.

turns out, I was telling him that he didn't need a meditation retreat to justify letting those thoughts go for the duration of the retreat, and he could begin to do that now -- but I was really telling myself that :) it's funny how that works. just have to get into the moment and focus on what's at hand, not all the other stuff[^2].

[1]: well, women in general really. I find that it brings about a sense of anxiousness in me. I like being in control of my own reality, and having other people there makes that more difficult. drugs are similar to women (sex) in that they are an accelerator, but I control it -- which is why I prefer drugs more. to compound the difficuly of feeling like I'm out of control, nosebook is behind all of the things, trying to manipulate everything. the thought of being with others right now in my present state, is absolutely *not* something I want to be doing. I prefer to wait till I'm connected, stable, and in control of things.

[2]: actually, after giving this some more thought, I realise that this is in fact what I'm looking for. this is the connection that I'm really aiming for. when I get into this state, everything sort of fades and I feel like neo on the matrix after his realisation when he's fighting one handed and everything is effortless. combine that with a focus where the whole world seems to fade away, and I don't even notice the other stuff happening, because it's not necessary to be present in the moment. it's really hard to explain. I wish that neo scene were slightly different, and it have you somehow the sense that the effortlessness came from focus, or rather lack of focus on the outside environment -- like the whole world blurred and started to become automatic and he just sits back and watches it. I know I can achieve this in daily life -- not just with the stars[^3].

[3]: it's all about letting those concerning thoughts go, and to stop worrying about all of this stuff that's out of my control. for example, the stress around this whole situation I'm describing is clearly the product of a whole lot of "trying to make things happen". I simply don't have to worry about them. LOA has them all worked out and I should just keep focusing on my own connection. it may seem like a frustrating thing to see from the outside, because it'll appear like I'm more and more happy and pleasant to be around, even though likely I'll appear more and more like I don't care at the same time. I do care though -- a lot, once I'm connected :)


### 2020-03-19 06:49 - a better way to look at it

let me just reframe last entry in the following way: we know that with certain conditions like sex or drugs, I can get connected. this is obvious because otherwise nosebook wouldn't have such a strong restriction on me for drugs. most likely, they have have a narrative they need to keep for you guys, and if I get connected from drugs, then that will make their narrative incorrect. for whatever reason they're pushing for some condition (which they control) to be the reason for my connection. rememeber, they *could* just let me go up when they want, but they don't want that. it feels like they need a justification for my connection which they can also attain (women), not stars (off limits), rethinking thoughts (they'll never change), or learning to leave all the daily concerns up to LOA to work out (can't happen; they need to be in control).

I want now more than ever to figure out how to get connected now without any conditions. that means without drugs such as coffee and other stimulants such as sex. I feel like I came to this point now and things are getting so easy, why not just go for the most difficult one yet. we all know I can do it with the right conditions, but can I do it without them? I'm sure I can. we'll ave to find out though, because I'm going for the energetic manifestation, not the physical conditions.

---

in a note in the last entry I mentioned that I girls (and sex) make me feel very out of control. well, I have established that the only real control that *anyone* has is the ability to feel the way they want to about the situation they're in. obviously, I don't feel the way I want to. I want to feel like I'm in control.

I don't know how to conjure that feeling because I've not yet discovered it yet (yes, there are still tons of otherworldly or "impossible" feelings still to be discovered and practised). so that means I have to find it. I also eluded to it in the previous entry talking about the meditation retreat: instead of waiting until I'm away (retreated) from life to finally allow the daily concerns to just exist and be there but not a concern (because LOA has it all worked out), is, I'm fairly sure, the way to achieving that feeling: finding a way in the middle of the details of life, to find a way to let all of those things just get worked out automatically, as I enter into that state which I described to johnathan as being able to hear the teacher (or whatever), but I was off somewhere else whereever my focus is.

I was just out this morning watching stars and I could get pretty easily to the letting everything else fade cept what I'm focused on (the star), pretty easily, but then a loud bird or truck or something would make a very loud sound and I would get startled. I'm not there yet. those things won't startle me anymore. in fact it will be like I don't even hear them.

also, I'm wanting to achieve that for daily life, and not just with the stars, so that I'm able to focus on what I want -- like my programming or whatever.


### 2020-03-20 06:53 - the political clones

yesterday when I woke up I had a kind of aha momement. the day previous, I was talking with mom and I told her that I had a theory which the politicians and lots of people in power are actually just AI controlled humans, designed to be as bad as possible. I figured they had to be operated by some alien race or something else that was interested in our evolution. the reason being, if you consider that perhaps humans may have bad ideas, but because of the LOA works, you cannot ever get rid of anything. so, in order to evolve us to something greater than the worst, you need something worser. I always thought of them as a kind of launch pad for us wanting to really go fast -- because, there's no way they can go that fast and continue to have those kinds of bad ideas. anyway, that idea became a bit more refined yesterday when I woke up.

I was thinking about the future version of earth where we would have contact with this planet and would be able to put consciousnesses through the -- let me just name them here for clarity: E is earth, and E' is the timeline that they're going to create where I never get connected, and they can setup their super-system where everything is under their control.

I'm pretty sure that sometime soon we're going to have the ability to transfer conscousness into he body of another timeline, cept it won't kill the body. I was thinking about this, and it would sort of be like neo on the matrix where he learned kung-fu "I know kung-fu!" -- it would seem like a second (or perhaps closer to instant) to us here on this planet, but to the person taking the journey it would feel like they lived out the life from birth to death on the other timeline. similar to a dream, a powerful vision, or a strong psychedelic experience, time would be compressed in such a way that it would feel instant. the mechanism would be quite simple actually.

when you are born and when you die, there is a tremendous amount of DMT in your system which means that those are the moments when you are least resistant and are "channeling" (or in tune with) the source version of you (the one without resistance, only focused on improvement "pure positive energy") and in those moments of extremely low resistance (birth and death), you'll be able to move consciousness in and out of the body with relative ease. so, you just setup that at the death of the body in the other timeline, you're conscoiusness is adjusted back to the body in the present timeline. obviously the "traveler" would have to be in an induced dream-like state already to begin with, so the traveler has full control of being able to get back into their body.

to the traveler, it would feel like they just had a very very intense and very long dream. however, the dream would have all sorts of benefits to it, because you could test your ability to get connected in a world where things are the designed to keep you away from that. certainly new and novel ways of figuring that out will continue to happen as both sides get better and better at it. there are infinite different situations that could take place and likely groups of people will go together to share a really great experience together in a difficult environment.

from the perspective of E', it's a bit different. they have to keep finding ways of controlling the things better, because each of us that comes through and gets close to or gets connected, threatens their fragile setup, so that person would have to be "dealt with" (probably killed or consciousness transferred over to somewhere else) -- meaning they just return back to their body. well, as more and more people get good at this, they can't possibly just kill anyone that's energetic. that's completely unsustainable and their planet will run out of people in a hurry, so they have to find a way of controlling and taking advantage of the energetic kids for as long as they can before getting rid of them.

they have to actually learn how to do this properly, but like I was saying to mom, knowing how LOA works, there's no way the US govt could possibly be still operational. it should have broke down and failed a long time ago with so many bad ideas. this situation would be even worse -- LOA's effect on them would be so storng, focusing on trying to control and get rid of stuff, that that this operation surely would fail or not get very far at all. there's no way it could last for any period of time, I reasoned.

well, when I woke up, I realised that it's probably not an alien race doing this, but actually fwh (my "future" self). because we think so much alike, I don't at all find this improbable. I would definitely do something like this. E' needs a source of sheep (E), but also a source of wolves (planet hope: H). in the same way that people on E' would continually get stronger and stronger, beating ever more difficult levels, the people on H would have to continue getting more and more controlling and unchanging in their ways.

let's take the subject of preparation for disaster. I have the perspective that preparation for disaster is exactly what attracts the disaster. funnily enough, if you skip the fear based sections of the gospels, written IMO after the timeline had split, where he talks about the "end of days" and gets people scared about that -- jesus exhorts us to "not worry" (mat 6:25-34). worry and preparation for those disasters is what brings those disasters

you can see that from the point of view for us her on E, we'll get better and better at creating our own reality, not letting circumstances, conditions, or the bad ideas that other people tell us to believe to interfere with our own craetion of reality. eg. if you're tuned into wellness, disaster can't become a part of your reality. those tuned into disaster will arrive on the scene attracting disaster, experience it, and then tell everyone, "see told you so! you need to prepare for it."

from the perspective of E', they will need to continue to try and avoid disaster and to prepare for and try and avoid the worst. you can see why this dream-life on E' is so compelling -- because we'll, through practice, get so good at knowing what we want to tune into, that creating whatever will become so easy and second-nature. anyone who can make it through the dream and get connected will be basically at the creative capacity of jesus (and much more) -- meaning that our desire to focus on well-being will be so strong, that anyone wanting to focus on disaster must create a time split.

---

so, you can see how this will become a problem over time for E' eventually the people being born there will be getting so powerful that they'll be getting more and more difficult to control. at the same time, you could imagine that because they have access to our timeline, they'll be able to track it (through my timeline) and see that we've gotten energetically so far ahead of them, there's no way they can possibly do a whole lot about it. I find it likely that depression will set in eventually as they realise the fuility of it all and begin to make their own choices about what it is they really want. these are the "souls" on H and H'. they'll eventually get there, but from the opposite direction. each iteration that they make, those consciousnesses who eventually give up on trying to control others' realities will likely be replaced by AIs who have been learning from them the whole time.

eventually, machines will run the world of E' making for a place where we can all continue to improve our creative capacity.

---

I'll be honest, I don't really understand the whole H and H' thing. I know there has to be an H' because fwh would have made a time split, too, and it's likely they're using their other timeline. I dunno.

also, now that I think about it, we're possibly H' and all of the hotshots from over there are the ones that want to go to the new timeline (E') because it'll be exactly what they want: a place where anyone can be manipulated to do whatever is wanted. there's no need for rape when you can manipulate them to consentually make your fantasies come true. so that world is really compelling for them. in the broader perspective though, that's really short-sided and totally misses the joy of creating the new thing that you want, instead of trying to manipulate what already exists.

I don't see it 100% clear yet, but it seems to me that probably the source of most of these hardasses are the "clones" that fwh talked about so often (and probably "controls") -- and repeatedly puts them in the situations which will create for us more contrast, so that they'll be "forced" to create their own timeline where they can control everyone. their timeline where they control everyone will continue to exist likely for a long time, and will probably be used as a "rite of passage" -- and they'll have an entire world (maybe soon a whole galaxy) where they control everything and maintain their technical superiority by stealing it from craetive people going through their dojo.  I'm glad someone wants to run a world like that becauso to me, I just don't thing it would be as fun as you might imagine it to be.


### 2020-03-21 07:28 - doing things my way

I'm in the process of beginning to feel the way I want to feel about things. how is it that I want to feel? I want to feel like I'm in control of my reality. I decide what I want to attract with my focus and therfore I'm in control of how I feel.

I realise that some people my disapprove of the way that I am going about it, but I don't really «give a rip» -- and the reason for it is, I don't really have anyone that can help me, and neither do I really want it. I know I can get there the way I'm going to go about it. it's probably not the fastest or the most optimum way either, but I think «you are addicted to the drama» anyway, so just let it play out. it'll be fine.

the thing is they are doing everything in their power to make sure I don't find a way to feel good. I can almost always be assured that any advice or help that people are giving me is to try and take that power away from me. let's take the example of cleaning my room. it's a total disaster. I hate living in such an untidy place. I really do. also, have you noticed that every time that I get stoned, I begin to start cleaning?

what's happening is, I feel good, so I want to be in a space that feels good, so I naturally begin to clean. when I feel good, I like things tidy and organised, I promise you. mom offered to help me to clean my room, and I think it's an OK idea, but I want to have the room relatively clean before she begins to help me. I think that nosebook wants me to rely on other people (females) to do things for me. you see, if mom were to come and clean up the room for me, but I never changed the chaos in my head -- my living environment is a reflection of the way I feel -- then, my room would go right back to chaos in a very short time.

for me, making action to change the way I feel almost never works. having a clean room, then going back to having a dirty room again is sorta like doing drugs (or going to a mediation retreat) to feel better, then when they wear off, life returns back to the chaos that it was previously. the only thing the drug did was to illuminate the contrast between the two states and produce stronger desire in me for what I want (which is a clean room).

I must first find my way toward feeling good. I have to become in control over the way I feel. I am taking steady progress toward that, and I am confident that I can get there. I prefer self-controlled contrast. if I control the contrast, then I can gain control over it. what I really want is control over my reality.

---

you may remember the picture illustrations that I made when I was at augustos house. in the first picture you can see a very stressed out version of me representing my left-hemisphere. this is where I'm at right now. that is me. that image symbolises the balance and equalisation of my two hemispheres (which is something that nosebook does not want me to have). the next picture, I say "it is done" and there is the headline "this is *my* reality" -- not "this is the reality nosebook wants me to have" or "this is the reality that people want me to have" or "this is the reality that someone else is in control of" -- this is *MY* reality.

as I begin to get better and better at feeling the way I want to feel, you will notice a whole different version of me. me and my entire reality (including everyone in it, because it's only attraction), will feel good, look good, etc. being around me will be like entering into an alternate dimension where everything is of such extreme quality and detail that everything feels visceral and delicious.

I'm obviously not there yet. I have to gain control over the way that I feel in order to get there. I anticipate that this is only the beginning of the difficulties, because what I'm essentially saying is that I will begin to feel the way I want to feel (amazing, good, successful, etc) -- not the way that nosebook wants me to feel which is powerless, in their control, and dependent or reliant on others, so they can control the way I feel by controlling the others. surely they will not respond to losing control like this, and much like a parent trying to fight with their child's desire, will try more and more physical methods to try and control someting that is way too strong for them to control.

---

I do feel pretty disconnected. I can't really feel anything anymore. I really don't know what to do about stuff because I just can't really feel much anymore. I consider it to be similar to flying an airplane in a situation without any visibility. you have to rely on your instruments, not your feelings. I'm essentially all logic based now because I don't have a very good sense (or I haven't found a way to reliably get the sense I'm looking for). when I don't feel the way forward, I don't make any action. I have to go on pure logic and my knwledge of how the universe and LOA works until then I regain my guidance system.

to all the girls that are going to make an effort to get included[^1], for now let's just remember you, and I'll revisit at a future time when I've got my senses back. that's probably to your advantage anyway because probably by that time I'm going to see really only see and attract the things I want (positive) aspects in those around me. so, for now I'll just say ok, remember that one or something like that.

I have tremendous confidence in the my understanding of things, and I'm really doing a lot of advanced techniques because I'm so sure of how it all works, but I just don't yet have the surity in what I feel right now. too much chaos still. you'll know when Im getting out of it, because my environment will reflect it. my room will probably be clean :)

[1]: yesterday, there was the one on villa st(?), the two on briargate (the house where I looked in their backyard after the wind blew their fence down). then, I felt something also with thad's neice too -- then most bizarrly of all when I was watching stars I kept feeling inclined to say that 10 (why ten, I dunno) french girls (selected by them), too. you can understand now, my aprehension to try and figure this out. logically, it would seem that some of that *has* be noise, rather than signal.


### 2020-03-25 10:40 - iterate it real good

last night after I came back from the last time losing consciousness in the field, I returned to watching stars and I had a funny sense come over me which was likely a reaction to whatever they are doing while I'm asleep. I assume they're working on their new timeline based on the reactions, but anyway... the feeling I got is that they're going to have to do a lot of iteration on their timeline until they get it. it felt to me like it was some sort of punishment or some form of hell, where they're forced to live out the conseuences of their situation until they fix it, in order to move forward.

imagine their case. this is just an example, and probably not the real version of it, so just go with it for the sake of example. imagine they can make their new timeline such that at the "end" of their new timeline, they decide to make a new timeline again, and go back to try again.. the reason why they would want to go back and try again would be because they want to optimise their situation and avoid some form of catastrophe.

you could say that the catastrophe will be caused by our solar system passing through the galactic current sheet, but I believe it's actually much more insideous than that. I think their difficulties arise internally, from such an accumulation of bad ideas.

imagine they get everything all setup and they're capable of making it through the galactic current sheet and everything. now, they're forced to face the reality of their own internal difficulties. each iteration, they're going to need to continually find their way around one corruption scandal after another, working thier way up to.. what? up to what? what is their end goal? certainly, if it's for the continuation of the organism, some bad ideas will need to be given up on so that the organisation can survive.

---

the situation I envisioned last night was kind of a funny one (not really though), but imagine that the noseboys were able to iterate so much such that they could get so high up in their form of perception that energetically, if they were to have sex with anyone not on their power level, the amount of electricity contained in their body would become harmful to the other person? I imagined the worst case: I imagined that it would cause death[^1]. in that far-out situation they would have to either stop having sex with humans, or just become ok with the idea that they must now have victims of their pleasure. or -- they would have to begin allowing the humans to rise up to a level so they can have sex with them. or, to select only certain authorised females which they could have sex with and allow them to be on a similar level with them -- but that would setup a group of females with superiority (which enevitably will expand).

this whole thought experiment was a test to try and see if I could come up with the worst possible outcomes in my brain. even though, it likely won't manifest in this form at all, I do know that the vibrational bit is sound. things will have some form of balance -- or, in other words, desire would never allow that to happen. it would create too strong of desire for that to continue to be a reality.

however though, there is a solution, and I think they'll arrive to it naturally, because I doubt there's even a chance that these guys will decide to change their ways; that's just impossible. so, each iteration, their version of reality will have to be more and more controlled by machines. this will help them to avoid the obvious corruption and infighting that will certainly take place. machines will have to be setup to run the entire world, in order to avoid these circumstances.

think about it like this: imagine that everything works out well, up until 2030, or something but in 2030, one of the main guys gets some idea that he needs to be paid more or receive more money because he's unhappy and this causes some huge problem. next iteration, they'll have to find out a way to ensure he doesn't get unhappy, so they make more ideal circumstances for him. similar things continue to happen until everyone in the company has to be put in some form of super ideal circumstances in order for the company to continue to function. the trend is to "buy off" (a technique used in a lot of corporations to get rid of problematic people) the probematic ones and put them into a situation where they're comfortable and not making problems. this will leave a core remnant of guys and means that team size is shrinking with each iteration, not expanding -- which means, more and more is being automated.

---

I think this is a good thing, because consider another reaction I had a few days ago, upon their begginning to realise that they are only able to control their small (infinitesimal really) "insignificant" slice of reality. I contest that it is insignificant so long as they look at purely from a numbers standpoint: 1/infinitiy = next to nothing, but if they're able to make an environment where *everything* is out of the humans control, and machines do the bidding of these godlike superhumans running the entire show, that *is*, something significant! why? because that means that an infinite number of us can continually use their planet as a sort of dojo to learn to value our connection above all other things. with everything out of our control, we'll gain tremendous practice to find that control inwardly.

also, it has a nice reciprocity to it. each of us will having experienced the contrast between connection and no connection, we'll learn to desire it more and more until it's a part of our makeup to search for that first. likewise, the core noseboys, will have a similar thing happening, where each iteration their realisation of something going wrong could theaten to take away their mega-perception, they too will gain stronger and stronger desire to find their connection. we'll eventually all be on the same page again, but have gotten there by different paths.

[1]: I imagined this as the most far out situation possible, which may or may not be a possibility, but just for extrapoation sake, it was what I came up with. the idea comes from what I believe was thoth's difficulty here on earth, and why he became so much of a loner.

### 2020-03-31 11:11 - thinking about what the buyoff thing means

one of the weird reactions I got to last entry's idea about the buyoff idea, is -- lemme back up a bit: one of the things that always puzzled me about one of the things that fwh said, is that "tesla reincarnaed in 2001" -- I was "reincarnated" (if I can use that term in such a loose way) in 2000, not 2001. the other thing that has always puzzled me is why he is the *former* white hat -- like he somehow converted to the dark side or something...

well, one of the major developments in the last few entries is that there's not just these two competing earths with timelines.. so imagine that nosebook goes and makes their own timeline, and we also have our own one too, that would make two earths -- or, two major timelines. however, recent developments (perhaps they're reactions even), I seem to be putting together the pieces of the puzzle of his crytic words, and they're beginning to paint the picture that fwh (and his idylwild group), are essenially in charge of making rediculous amounts of contrast, for our benefit.

he routinely talked about cloning people and weirdly talking about these strange things like russia being involved with some timewings or something hokey like that.

let me go back even further: this all started when I told mom that I think that the "world leaders" and the guys in charge I think are perhaps AI controlled by an alien race interested in creating contrast for our benefit. there's absolutely no possible way that these guys could actually sustain things the way they're running them. you simply cannot be focused that much on unwanted and have a system with that kind of uptime. LOA tells me this isn't possible, so something else *must* be happening for them to even come remotely close to the success they're having.

the more then that I thought about it, the more I realised that if I were given the opportunity to "convert to the dark side", and create (on purpose) and control a bunch of knuckleheads in charge of the world, creating disaster after disaster -- never so much that it's paralysing to the people, but just enough to force people to find their alignment instead of waiting for the world's conditions to improve, to begin find a way to feel good, I would *TOTALLY* do it.

knowing that the outcome of such an endeavour would be an entire earth populatation capable of jesus-like strength and resolve, it wouldn't bother me at all to set something like that up -- and my own belief and knowing that it would create (and bring out) truely the best in people (after some hundreds(?) of years of iteration). in fact, that is how I myself would prefer to learn: put me in a difficult siuation where I have no other option than to find a way to feel the way I want to feel, and put some great reward at the end.

if I could do that to myself, I would do it :) see where I'm going with this? then, imagine that people watching me go through this felt -- jealousy isn't the right word, but desire that they could have some similar thing happen to them -- well, then you have a whole planet of people desiring to learn things the "hard" way like I did, cause they see the reward at the end and also want that for theirselves.

combine that with the canopy of energy prevailent during this whole process that, "you can't just get something that wonderful for free; you have to *earn* it" add in the whole recognition that I was (and to some extent still am), a very addictive personality type, and the "reward" that comes at the end of this mind-numbing process (think facebook games) is some really great feeling. I'm essentially an example of a human's wildest desire in the sense that I'm an egotistical addict that found a way to leverage that to my advantage -- and that seems to have inspired quite a bit of desire in a whole lot of other people, similarly[^1] and I have essentially become a great example for people -- something they can see and say, well, if he can do it, then I guess it's possible.

---

so, I venture to guess that all of this timeline crazytalk I've been carrying on about, appears to be the taking shape to be the manifestation of those desires and energies.

what if the future of this planet were a place where eventually everyone were to be treated like I am now. the contrast would be so enormous, and the asking and the manifestation would also be, too.

---

so, when I said that tesla "reincarnated" in 2001, I have to imagine some 19 year old genius working for nosebook has quickly become someone very important in their company -- something easy to do when you're doing everything with your mind.

so now imagine that each time they need to make a new timeline (to get further along), there will people members of the team which will likely not quite make the cut, and will ge left behind. each iteration their capacity to control things will improve until finally I would imagine that the whole world is controlled by machines. I would also imagine that the very last iteration, only one guy will make the timeline and he'll (I assume it's a he, but it doesn't have to be) leave everyone too resistant to survive the galactic thing and the transition the earth is in the process of making.

the personality type of the last guy there would have to be one that is secretive, very concerned with efficiency (and therefore increasing the energy levels of the planet to achive that efficiency), someone very interested in gaining the efficiency of a machine, one who is mechanically interested in "incraesing human energy" as if it were a machine, a "loner", one who likes being single (cause a relationship with someone would compromise his creative energies) -- basically someone exactly like tesla would be the porfect guy to accomplish this becomming the guy who would want to make this perfectly contrasting environment for us where we have literally *zero* control over our physical experience, but only the option to learn to feel the way we want to feel (just like I learned to do).

tesla alluded to the idea that when he was youger he had audiory and visual hallucinations quite frequently, and it plagued him for some time before learning to control it. he never says, exactly how he learned to control it, but in various places he alludes to the idae that it was gaining emotional control, and his hallucinations directly followed the way he felt and what he had been previously thinking about or had just recently seen, recognising that his hallucinations and dreams always had the previous thing of that type that he had most recently seen or heard or gave his thought attention to.

it's also clearly obvious that tesla had some rare condition where his brain had enormous amounts of DMT in it. that would certainly explain his visual capability, his excellent eyesight, his hearing, hallucinations, and just about everything he considered to be a malady [TODO: lookup exact quote for what he referred to it as]. so, it's no surprise to me that a good portion of the population has had their DMT levels artificially boosted. it looks like it's kind of like the best of bost worlds. you get the DMT levels that tesla had, but without the hallucinations, but also without the abiity to conjure images in 3d space, which is considered a "hallucination" (like me).

eventually, only one person (this tesla type) running the whole show will have picture capacity. everyone else will have their hallucinations (ability to conjure images in 3d space) disabled until they they're capable (also like me) to find their alignment/connection.

---

so last night when I was star watching, the second time arond I got to looking at the lyra star when they took my consciousness away from me again. I came back and I had this overwhelming sensation that the guys doing the timeline either have already taken off, are going to take off, or maybe just mr. motor is fearing them taking off. however, I got this overwhelming sensation that they're going to peace out sometime, and when they do, all of their best guys are going, leaving the company crash and burn tremendously. the way it felt to me is that they would leave the ones that are not at all helpful in creating the new timeline -- the ones that, with their enduring fixation on unwanted, make the new timeline more difficult, so they just get left behind here. if all the talent and "alignment" leaves the company, that only leaves those with their perception fixated on unwanted, meaning things will fall apart all by theirselves. none of us have to do anything.

there are some more questions/reactions I'm feeling about this whole idea of fwh's planet hope feeding and controlling the knuckleheads, and this planet becoming the one that feeds the enlightened ones... it's a bit of a length more o write that. I'll get to it soon :) this is a tremendously enjoyable mental game (experiment) to play arund with in my mind.

I have felt like I do when I'm in a dream -- where I'm doing stuff, and stuff is happening, but it's all so bizarre, I don't recognise how anomalous it is until I start becoming conscious in the dream that I begin to understand what's relly happening[^2].. simialrly, I feel like this is what's happening in reality for me. the mental game is a nice way for me to begin to become conscious -- because until then it just feels like a buch of really bizarre things happening that all feel really normal and not out of place.

[1]: thanks for the feeling you transmitted andreas in your icon lightend video. it feel this concept more clearly.

[2]: for example last night the first time I lost conscoiusness, I regained it in the middle of a dream. I was in an elevator that went was going down toward the groud so rapidly, that in the dream my feet weren't touching the ground -- I was floating. elevtors don't do that, and unless they were being propelled downward, your feet would never leave the ground as if you were in a weightless environment. the dream was so real, I consciously began making preprations for the impact when the elevator reaches the bottom, by lowering myself down to the ground so that I would bounce with the elevator when it came to the bottom. I kept trying to lay down on the floor, so that my spine wouldn't be compressed on impact, but I kept floating upward. turns out the elevawtor slowed down rather rapidly, I felt no deacceleration and woke up after trying to find a "weapon" ... I immediately realised that the incredible downward force I felt was the force that I feel when they do whatever it is they do when I sleep to remove all my energy, and I become conscious and they stop it, I almost always wake up with my feet and legs numb. I've begun to train myself to recognise that feeling as not what it appears to be in the dream, but the neutralisation of energy in my body -- so that I can more quicly become conscious in the dream (or not lose consciousness in the first place)

### 2020-04-01 12:37 - hooked on contrast (really) works for me!

one of the things that abraham always says is that you didn't come here so that you would have everything all laid out pefectly so you could just experience and enjoy them -- instead, you came to identify the desire and line up with it...

the more I've been getting used to this, every time I feel bad (for whatever reason), I know there's already a new really good feeling following it. I just have to find it and line up with it. it's really easy...

one of the interesting reactions that I got to the previous entry was that, "great, that means that it should be easy" -- well, I doubt it. a crash and burn of their magnitude prolly takes quite a while (years I imagine), and it'll create tons of contrast on the way. I don't think we're on the easy road.

### 2020-04-11 22:43 - the magic of mushrooms (and source)... lol

I wrote this whole long question thing out before listenening to the broadcast of the 9th, asking about mushrooms. I individually came to the conclusion this morning that I would attempt to grow the mushrooms, and if they didn't grow that's cool, and if they did, that's also cool, too. I had nothing to lose. I also decided that I wouldn't be trying to pin everything on one day, so instead of putting all of my eggs in my birthday basket, I would instead just try and grow a lot of mushrooms and use them as an accelerant, just like I do with the stars.

assuming I could get the mushroom production up and running, I reasoned that I would have to find ways to release resitance really rapidly because I would continue to increase the dosage until I'm stable at extremely high dosages. then, when I came back down, nosebook would ensure I didn't get that high again, which just like my star-watching, actually increases my capacity. I think the most safe and productive route will be to gain levels as rapidly as possible.

so I go outside later this evening to check on the cloud situation to see if I can watch stars, and I notice a bunch of mushrooms grew in the backyard. you have to understand how impossible this is. they grew in some woodchips that had been covered with dirt, pushed their way up through the dirt and all of this without a single bit of moisture. it hasn't rained or showed in a few weeks to a month now and the climate is quite warm. these aren't a suitable mushroom growing environment. I don't know how they grew, honestly. there's no way they should have been able to grow, I assure you.

it's a funny sign for me though, so I guess that solves the question I had... I'm going to try and see if I can grow a bunch more, and also eat the ones I have, hopefully accelerating this thing tremendously :)

sweet.


### 2020-04-15 14:11 - things might take a while...

this afternoon I went out to go take a walk and one of the things that I felt like I was feeling was the reaction that some girls should have some sort of priority. a little bit ago (I can't remember how long ago it was now), I felt like one of the responses to my previous questions about "go big or go home", it seemed to me like some sort of plans were beginning to be made.

I didn't really mind at first, because I don't really have much in the way of plans at all. my *only* objective is to get connected beforehand. there's no other real prerequisite than that.

so, with that in mind, when there were ideas coming into my head about some with more priority than others, I didn't really feel much resistance, and I went with it for a bit, but it became obvious that there would be quite a few with "priority" -- and I left it at that. I don't really think it's much of a thing to worry about, because I don't really think I'll be getting connected anytime soon.

if I had to guess, I would guess a year or so from now. however, as with all my time estimates, a good rule is to double it -- so two years or so, I guess. I really can't see that far ahead, and I don't really want to try, either. when I look out, there still seems to be so much to accomplish that I just don't see it happening anytime soon.

however, I will say there is one factor that may play a role here, and it's that I've been noticing that nosebook has been making a whole lot more mistakes recently. they simply don't have the iron grip on my energetic output like they used to, and I've had more and more frequent instances where I become conscious in dreams or whatever that they don't want me to have happen. so who knows, there... but even still, their rate of making mistakes isn't accelerating at such a rate where I could possibly believe they could make a huge mistake anytime soon, and certainly not in the next half of a year or so.

I do know that this summer will be a *huge* expansion of my consiousness, and I'm really not worried about it. I'm really enjoying where I'm at right now and the programming that I'm doing is quite a lot of fun, actually. I really don't feel like there's any need to try and rush anything.

after my last big programming stint, I slept like 20 hours straight, pretty much -- and one of the main influences upon my consciousness was initiated by this video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CameSDK-2m8), because it's the line where jesus (christ superstar) says, "whyyyyyyy must I die" -- which immediately puts in my brain the picture that terence mckenna puts with his quantum soliton of improbability -- where two timelines are created, one where jesus dies, and one where ho goes on to be the influence that propells humankind into a sort of super future of incredible growth and exapansion, while the timeline where he dies, things kind of go downhill.

I beiieve I'm in a bit of a similar situation, where two major timelines are being created. I have no idea what timeline my perception is on, and it doesn't really matter to me. the feeling that I kept getting when I would wake up during those long hours of sleep is that the manifestation (of the girls) simply woudln't take place.

you know, that doesn't really bother me all that much. abraham always says to, "not need the manifestation" -- and I've totally gotten there. if it happens, great, but it if it also doesn't happen, to be quite honest, it would be a bit of a relief for me. I honestly don't really have any confidence in things working out very well, unless I'm connected and can stay that way.

it may be a while. don't let it bother you. try to find yourself, like me where you're so much more enjoying the absence of the manifestation.

then, while the manifestation still feels overwhelming, that just means that it's bigger still than you're allowing right now, so then just enjoy the expansion...

this is what I mean by I'm sure that there is still quite a bit more expansion for me to go.

putting that in practical terms, I would have to imagine that in order for this to work out, I have to first get connceted (a while away), then I think it would be cool (if not almost necessary) if I actually have this website running and going as well, then I think it would be a much smoother transition. finally, if that's also the case, getting a round of finance for the "website" also would mean we could do the whole thing, without a single bit of nosebook's "help" -- forgive me, but I don't find them very helpful, if you know what I mean. I would really enjoy if we could finance the whole thing ourselves, and the girls are all getting a piece of the thing we're creating. it's an idea that has come up a few times while meditating now, and I know (for sure) that nosebook isn't putting that thought there.

maybe we want to hold out a bit until we can do the whole thing without their "help"...

maybe that's what's taking so long. if I think about it from a culmination of multiple different timelines, point of view, it means that all of our "future" selves are continuing to push us further and further down the timeline toward something all of us are collectively wanting to manifest. it may be this, or it may be something more... I don't know yet. we'll have to see.


### 2020-04-26 12:37 - appreciating the contrast

scruple: a feeling of doubt or hesitation with regard to the morality or propriety of a course of action.

jaron just got a new board game called "scruple" and I was looking through it because I found it fascinating. there are these dilemma cards which you're supposed to ask another person and then the person is supposed to lie about their response to the dilemma or to tell the truth. your goal is to get rid of your dilemma cards to win the game. that style of play makes your answers more loose in the sense that you never have to reveal how you really feel about the dilemma.

I find the dilemmas to be quite a funny thing because thanks to LOA I essentially don't need to worry about the majority of them showing up in my life, so I'm pretty much saved from having these dilemmas come up in real life. I realised then that by reading and focusing on these dilemmas, I am actually attracting these sorts of things into my experience much more than I would if I just lived life normally.

I started to read them, and I kinda got addicted to answering these questions. they revealed to me a whole lot that I hadn't really paid much attention to previously.

#### I have an extremely low opinion of law enforcement

in quite a few questions I would leave the person stranded or, simply not get involved just to avoid having to spend time in a police station or givng a statement...

in my experience, the police have no interest in actually providing any form of justice (I mean the system as a whole; not the individual police officers, which I am certain because I've met quite a few which are actually really decent dudes). actually to give a great example of this, when I gave my money to a cocked out guy the police that interacted with me were quite great guys. we chatted for many hours in the car on the ride up to san sebastian. I have no doubt that there are tons of great police officers; that's not my point.

my point is that the system in which they operate is terrible. when I had my laptop stolen, they knew exactly the guy who did it, and I'm sure they recovered the laptop from him -- however, because they had to keep their secrecy that they could not see through my eyes, I never got my laptop back. it's fine because I still had enough money to buy another one, but even still later when I didn't have money, their secret was still far more important than my well-being. agsin, it's fine because they're not the source of my well-being -- and just when I needed it marcos totally came through for me.

my point is, they aren't the police that you see on tv. that's a totally idealised (fictional) version that is almost entirely created in the writer's head to make an entertaining program which appeals to the audience's sense of justice. it has no basis on reality.

I've sat in the police station for probably more than 20 hours or more giving reports and stuff, and there has never been anything returned to me. their entire goal right now is to make sure that I *don't* have any money. I don't ever imagine that they will ever wish that I have any success either and probably perceive me as a huge liability, even though I am the reason why they have all of you in their network and tracked so well. they make who knows how much money off of me, and there's no way I'll ever see any part of it -- which again, is quite fine because they *arn't* the source of my well-being.

#### I will avoid helping someone or ensuring some sort of justice to avoid interacting with law enforcement

once again, for a lot of the same reasons, and I've always kinda been this way, but knowing what I know now about everyting being attraction, I simply do not want to get involved in something like that. if I am witness to seeing something, then I have to wonder what it is in my vibration that is attracting an experince such as that. I simply do not want to help people because the penalty for it is thrice:

1. focusing my attention on the problem attracts more of it into my own experience.
2. the other person has attracted the situation in the first place, and there's nothing that I can do about that.
3. I attracted witnessing the situation, so that is illicitiing a response from me. in those cases there is something then that I can do (or else it wouldn't have happened in my experience, because no longer do I have the vibration of a helpless bystander of some attrocity)

#### most of the situations I actually would react in response to what I feel

I began to notice that a lot of the situations, I can't just hear the "hechos" (deeds/actions) and make an immediate decision as to how to respond. I instinctually follow how I feel now and in a quite a few (most) of the cases, I don't think I would do the response I was asked about, but do something entirely different. meaning, I don't think they offered the best response, and were forcing me to say yes or no I would make action on what I think is a mediocre response.

---

the game is a long slog of trying to solve something with limp action, when energetically it makes no real sense at all. the game kind of inspires me a bit to reframe the ideas a bit and to take a more feeling approach to some of the questions. I'll experiment with the idea on jaron next breakfast and see how it goes. until then, enjoy reacting to, and the resulting contrast provided by of some of my extreme responses :)


### 2020-05-01 07:38 - bad feeling reaction?

last night I was walking out to the field and I had this really good feeling thing pop into my head because I was noticing as I was star-watching last night that it seemed like the difference between "how real" the manifestation of the girls thing was at the beginning of the night and then, when I was walking out (~3:30), and I was really feeling like it was all kinda falling into place, and everyting was good.

the thought was was coming to me was how much I just didn't need to try and force something, make it happen or even effort things into place. you see, I had just been having the thought on my mind about the whole computer shutting down thing, and I was thinking also about how I took a detour trying to get my database working the hard way, yet instead I have since decided that I'll just force myself to learn ecto, even though it appeared to me super complicated at first.

anyway, so I was thinking about how I was going to try and effort the database into place and try real hard to get it all ready. when I was walking out there, I had this great feeling that even though it appears like the whole computer shutting down thing was a loss of time, it is more energy added into the equation, and there are some positive aspects to it too, most namely it's great practice for me even more to get better at getting into the "zone". I can do now in just a few hours what used to take me perhaps days or weeks, previously. it's also improving my capacity to hold the concept in my head, even through an interruption (and I'm sure there will be interruptions with so many different girls), so it's kinda ok -- actually.

---

anyway, so as I continued to watch stars, I noticed a lowering down of feeling, and I'm pretty sure it was various reactions in response to my monologue last night about not needing to worry about the timing. I (probably foolishly) gave an example of what I thought was the *worst case* scenario, which I believed with my current progress, I could pretty much guarantee that I'll be pretty well connected by the end of the year.

I don't really know how it'll happen. I don't know if just at some point I'll surpass their ability to contain the energy in my body and it'll be like an avalanche, or if -- like esther -- source will just kinda take over and nuetralise their neutralisation. I don't know. I tend to think and acually believe that it'll be more of the first than the second. perhaps a combination of the two when all of the moving parts are in place... I really don't know.

but, that's what I was saying last night -- it just gives me the feeling of so much freedom to know that I don't need to worry about any of it at all. I just need to keep following my good-feeling inspiration and that's it :)

so, I guess, if my monologue made you feel bad in some way[^1], just know that your inner being isn't looking at it the same way you are. it felt good to me and I'm certain that everything is fine. I promise.

[^1]: there was a whole lot of "he's going to drag this out forever" or "this is going to take foreever" -- and another one that had to do with coronavirus that I didn't understand, but I didn't care to investigate further, either.

### 2020-05-10 00:25 - coming enlighnenment

I just watched a series of interesting videos on past times, which made me want to write a long comment about what I thought about modern "initiation" and "enlightenment" compared to times past.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPixqRq-zXg) 28:40 - in regard to the 16 figures with the heads of birds, and 32 with human heads...

I have often wondered about why there are so many depictions of various "gods" with wings, and also with quite a few as birds (especially notable also in egypt). I think these figures represent a series of "rulers" -- 16 of them the original "gods" -- which are depicted as birds. then, there were 32 humans which are depicted with wings.

there is a similar motif with the sumerians. ancient architects did a video on sumerians in south america here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8NnX2ObQwA)

the principal video that I think shows this bag, the tree of life, and pinecone motifs can be seen here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvdrkSUVn70)

in it, he talks about how there were original "gods" that walked with the humans, and taught them things. they are always shown as the birds and hold bags in their hands. the initiation ritual is to open up the pinecone and the tree of life, which represents enlightenment and is said to give wings.

this sort of thing appears in a lot of different sources, but it seems to me that, going by the theory of the different pacha stages of humankind, the earliest stage, the gods walked with the humans, and these gods were the birds. they initiated humans and taught them "enighenment" -- and so subsequently these initiated humans also had wings (were able to fly).

it seems there are natural flying gods, and then humans rulers or gods which were initiated in some way to gain the ability to fly.

---

(sidebar) another interesting thing to note here is the reptile/bird symbolism. we know that numerous dinosaur birds (pteradactyl) simply would not be able to fly in gravitic conditions of today's earth and we also know that dinosaurs were likely feathered beasts and are the predecesors to the modern bird. I don't really know what to make of it, but it is noteworthy, considering that (following the pacha theory) that gravitic changes caused by the earth moving away from the sun god could easily explain the extinction of the dinosaurs (which later evolved into birds). science believes that earth's gravity is actuually a universal constant, but I believe that is geocentrism and very unlikely.

---

so, this doorway, I think could be symbolising the transition from the first (hanan pacha) where we had direct connection to the sun god, down to the second pacha.

an interesting thing to note here too is that the megalithic work of the 1st pacha is very curved and natural, as if the stone were able to be moulded, then the second pacha, seems that things are now all right angles and straight lines.

therefore, I'm going to go out on quite a limb here, it seems quite probable to me that in the 1st pacha, the bird gods, and probably the initiated humans were able to fly, mould rock and lift it effortlessly with their minds. I believe this is a function of the mind and is much more off limits to us now because of our distance from the sun.. so, as the earth transiioned to the 2nd pacha, this style of masonry and travel became more difficult, and so proper conditions needed to be met to be able to achieve these capabilities: now, angles and numbers and astrological conditions needed to be paid close attention to for those initiated in the secrets (masons) to be able to achive.

I think that the pyramids and other such structures were methods by which to use angles and maths and sciences to create conditions in which humans could become gods and return back to this garden of eden-like environment of mental non-resistance of a dream-state-like reality. this was probably kept a big secret from everyone, and people were only given the watered-down version of this mental state in the form of religion.

finally, we're now in the 3rd pacha now and we're considerably more separated from the sun god and all of this stuff is still possible but because the conditions (distance from the sun) and the other energetic conditions produced by the pyramids, etc.  all of this stuff is a complete mystery to us, but I believe that these sorts of mental states can be achieved within the person without the energetic conditions previously provided by our distance to the sun or the operation of these geometrically tuned structures.


### 2020-05-11 07:10 - a strange idea about the coronavirus

the previous entry spawned a lot of new discussions in my mind, to which I will continue on that thread in the future..

however, this morning, I woke up with a strange idea that perhaps the coronavirus is actually what we're calling the physical manifestation of people all over the world's frequencies being raised.

the idea was that as I continue to get vision upgrades, instead of letting the gap between me and others continue to widen, they are actually putting people up to my speed, and the result of this is if it's oo fast for you, you'll begin to have physical difficulty.

---

I have no idea if it's true or not, and you may say, "but I definitely don't see as good as kenny does, so that's impossible" -- but just because you don't see like I do, doesn't mean that your brain isn't being clocked to that speed. they do blur people's vision, as they are already doing with mine: -- have you noiced that everyone can see out of my eyes better than I can? the other day I had a pretty signicant vision upgrade where things changed quite considerably, and jaron complained about having a lot of pain that morning when trying to get up. I also noticed that his vision was much more blurry than usual as well, because he couldn't see a black square at a distance (something that I can see, and I usually have a harder time than he does at seeing things)

this obviously means to me that they're keeping jaron on par with where I am, but because he's still got quite a bit more resistance than I do, he probably does not see the same as I do, even though his brain is going at the same speed. this further implies that perhaps jaron's brain may be used to provide "imagination" for people on the lower end of the spectrum, and mine is used as the upper end of the spectrum. I doubt that there are others that are further along than I am, but I don't know if jaron is beign used to provide imagination for the lower end of the spectrum or not. that's completely unknown to me.

it could also be that they're putting everyone up to my speed, and I'm only noticing the effects that must be happening to quite a few in jaron. if what's happenining to jaron is also happening to pretty much everyone[^1] in the first-world, it would make sense therefore that people are being clocked up to my speed, even if they haven't released resistance in order to get there. it just makes for a more intense ride, if you're thoughts have more power because you're running at a faster speed.

it's probably a good idea that we're on lockdown while this continues to happen, because in our normal everyday stressful lives things would be much more intense, and this is a way to kind of mitigate the amount of extra stress and conflict that would otherwise be generated.

---

it seems that at the same time, they're really trying their hardest to keep me from going up as fast as I want to go up. I've been sleeping a *LOT* lately.. like 16 hours a day or so, and I have pretty severe lethargy, which they (abraham) also mentioned in the previous episode that's only evidence that I'm not letting all of me through -- which means there's still more resestance.

regarding the resistance that seems to keep coming out of nowhere after I wake up from sleeping, I believe that something happens when I'm asleep, and I don't really know what, but there's a definitel hour or two after I wake up where I'm a complete zombie empty of energy, but after a little bit I'm back up and feeling better again.

I've been getting a lot of vision upgradess without even watching stars, so I think what's happening is that I wake up at say 200 units of energy, and say the next vision upgrade is at 800, I manage to get there even without watching stars or anything. I just get back to thinking thoughts that don't block that non-physsical energy from flowing. the longer I'm awake and clear minded, the more this effect is, and the more energy I accumulate and I get vision upgrades. seems every time that I release more and more resistant thought, the more rapid I build up to getting to the next energy level where the upgrade is -- so that's probably why I'm sleeping so many times per day right now.

---

as a result, I think it's of benefit (for you guys) that things are going kinda slow. if I were to just go really really fast, I would basically get connected really really quick and you all would be kinda left behind in that way, however by doing it this way, you all are essentially going through your initiation like I described in the previous entry with the sumerian bag @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvdrkSUVn70) and your pinecone (pineal) is being slowly opened as I continue to get more and more vision upgrades.

therefore, I think it's actually beneficial if this process takes even longer than is presently expected, so that you can all continue to go up with me. I realise that there is a bit of expectation around my birthday, but I would instead just say that we should continue to go up slowly and not make any huge jumps. the ones along the way (in the first-world contries) who can't figure out a way of operating at the new speed will get the "coronavirus" -- then, with the new physical condition, they can either figure out how to recover from it and operate at the new speed or make their transition (if in fact the idea that I woke up with this morning has merit).

[1]: the reason I say pretty much everyone, is because in the last episode of abraham now (2020-05-07) they mentioned that people were seeing more, and this was the day of the major vision upgrade I think -- and they also said that there are a lot of people unaware of the coronavirus and are also completely unaffected by it.

### 2020-05-11 11:49 - quick answers

#### why do I think it's a good idea that we go slow and more make it up?

imagine life like a giant wide-open arena (mostly flat terrain) with a bunch of cars driving around in it. imagine that some of the people can actually see through their windshields and others have quite a while since their last carwash. while most of the people right now are not required to drive around right now (or drive very little in isolated areas), the time will soon come when we're all driving around again.

there's a catch though: the relative speed of their car is not determined very much by their brake pedal; the brakes are sluggish and don't really let you slow before too much of a minimum speed, while the gas pedal is very rapid[^1]. so let's say that the slowest of cars (when they're not awake) all go between 150-250mph, but never less (until they park it by going to sleep).

some people will have decent conditions to drive in the arena, meaning that they can afford a regualar car-wash or working windshield wipers or whatever (the metaphor is really breaking down here) to have more optimal driving conditions. while only some of the population actually has decent visibility in their cars, additionally, only some will actually know how to drive at that speed. some will have both.

you can tell that if you have more optimal conditions like a clean windshield and a responsive car (or the money to continually replace and repair any damage caused by our reckless driving), that you don't need to know how to drive, because your conditions are good enough you a much better chance of avoiding serious damage[^2].

back to the question: why would I think it's a good idea that the energy rise slower allowing peole more time to acclamate to the energy, giving more people a chance to become "enlightend"?

it's more contrast. otherwise, the arena would be very empty, with only a few people driving around fast. clearly you want to have more people and more opporunities for an impact, so that the mediocre drivers get good fast, the bad drivers can make a quick turnaround and learn to drive, and the good drivers can become excellent really rapidly.

there's more that I think it's beneficial for in the longer-term as well, which I'll mention soon enough.

#### something about widening the gap of superiority between the first and the third-world

I don't know how to describe this reaction in words, so I'll just talk about it. first, it's not my decision. if you want to know about the details you need to talk to nosebook. I don't make the decision about who gets to run at my brain's speed or not. I am purely focused on releasing any resistance that arises, to ensure that I continue on in progression toward releasing enough resistance that I'm so chronically connected that the girls thing happens.

I think though, that you all agreed to it by wanted to run your brains at my brain's speed, so that you could be apart and witness the broadcasts. the only thing that's happening this way, is I'm going slowly up to the 5th dimension and you all are coming with me.

don't worry about the third-world though -- and if you insist that it's something to be worried about, let me know how that works for you. when you worry about that, you probably (most assuredly) feel quite bad about it. that is your first indicator that your source does not perceive it the same way. in fact, the reason why a lot of this whole coronavirus thing is happening is because there is a whole lot of (probably from the topics of conversation around the election) comparison and focus on the disparity between the different classes of income and such. some of them may feel jealousy to us, but it's quite possible that they'll look at us about the way that we look at the characters in the illiad -- thinking that we live in a dysfunctional madhouse. it's all perspective.

#### do I think that people will fly?

probably. I don't know if it'll be right away or not, but as people get better and better at driving, they'll release enough resistance that they'll be able to feel light enough to take off.. it'll likely happen, yeah. you may be thinking that you may want to learn to drive fast first, though.

#### do I think there will be conditional drivers that can fly

almost certainly. there's no reason why -- I can't think of, anyway, that conditional drivers won't be able to also find a way to do that too.

#### will flight be like a college degree?

I imagine it'll also likely be like anything else vibrational, where you will either need good enough conditions for it to occur, or you'll need to have released enough mental resistance. until the conditions of the planet provide enough to allow flight, it may be that we're going to be kinda on the edge between feeling enough freedom to fly or not, and you may have times when you're not capable of flight because emotionally you're not in a good enough of a spot.

when the energetic conditions of the planet provide enough of a feeling of well-being, even if you're in a tough spot, or you live in the third-world, anyone who wants to probably can. I guess, before then, we (the guys in charge) can maybe enact laws so others feel safe, to descourage flying under emotional distress -- or something :)

[1]: ever wonder why so many of the stories of these ruling "gods" on planet earth in past times seemed to have extremely rapidly accelrating tempers and virtually no control over it? I think they really were "enlightened" :)

[2]: it's no wonder the previous ruling class always needed much more optimal conditions with a reduction of things that could make them feel bad -- moreso, than the people under their rule, anyway -- because if they could have been in such awful conditions under that kind of "enlightenment", it would have been a *very* rough ride, indeed.


### 2020-05-14 11:49 - illusions and "overpowering" nosebook

a few times I had questioned how I would get past nosebook's effect on me, postulating that I might "overpower" them, and simply summon/channel more energy than they're able to control. to some degree, I'm kinda right, but I understand it a lot better now and I thought it might be good to explain, because this is the "secret" to understanding what I was talking about in the last entry about the "initiation"... (which was only the name I gave it, because of the "tree of life" and the handbag symolism)

it's not really an initiation in the sense that it's a ritual to increase one's enlightenment through an energetic means, even though that may very well happen with people participating in the broadcasts, and it most likely will be for the girls. in a sense I have been using conditions such as stars or drugs to artificially increase my energy levels, so sex or participating in the broadcast will certainly fall into that category, too.

however, what it really is, is -- ever notice how abraham always says something like, "your cork will rise if you don't do that thing you do to hold it down." -- well, that thing we do is, find excuses to feel bad.

lately, I've felt it's important to take a stance where I'm no longer fighting against things. by nature, I go till the bitter end with a battle. I was one of those kids that didn't sleep, and fought it until the end because I thought I was missing out. I fought against everything that I didn't feel was the way I wanted, and that made me pretty fearless. I've told many times about how, with the mushrooms, I learned not to fight agaist those things and to just accept them as more energy. this is, in combination with what abraham teaches, in combination with a huge importance on emotional awareness, my "message"

I only call it a message because I don't really know what to call it, but as I continue on here, you will find, and I am and will soon be proving that once ypu can hold the emotion that you want to feel, reality *must* conform to how you feel, and there is no physical strength stronger than it.

---

the last few days I have noticed that every time that I would begin to get some momentum in my programming and start to really feel good about what I was creating, my computer would get shut down. that kinda sent me into a bit of a downward spiral for a bit -- however if it was night, I would just go star-watch, even though I could tell there was mounting desparation in me, because I couldn't figure out how, if I can't get momentum on it, would I ever finish it.

I came to the conclusion that the arbitrary deadline of my birthday simply would not be reached, and there's no problem with that because coming to that conclusion made me feel quite a bit better. so I feel less stress there, but the goal is not my programming. the goal is «joyous expansion» -- with the emphasis on the *joy* bit.

so, I simply have to find a way to "redefine" my reality in a way which makes me feel good about my circumstances/conditions. then, when I no longer use the conditions or circumstances as a reason to feel bad, my "cork" will continue to rise, and I'll eventually "overpower" them, because there will no longer be anything that can pull my cork back down by feeling bad, and it'll simply continue to rise and rise.

---

so, what I think this means in the bigger picture is that as we continue on, there will be more and more reasons (unjustices, etc.) to feel bad as the new gods[^1] continue to gain more and more power and influence and seemingly "lord" it over the uninitiated masses.

these are all conditions designed to make you feel less-than, or insuperior to them -- and therefore bad. previously it was economics that was used as the class system, but it looks to me like we're returning more back to how things were in the the first pacha[^2], where abundance was "normal" -- so the class system had more to do with perception and "magical capabilities".

the coming times are the age of the "physical" (7th ray) and, is why I believe there are so many autistic people being born. it's the age of magic, where physical manifestation becomes very rapid.

---

ok, so now on to the last topic here, which will tie it all together: illusion. since the recent encounter with the mother of the neighbour in front of me (he father is mike), I have been giving more and more thought to illusion, because she's a very illusory person. I perform illusion all the time, but I'm not totally aware of it. I am a much more simple person in the sense that I have to follow my emotion, and by doing that, my "inner being" makes a whole lot of "illusions" for you guys.

so, what is an illusion? an illusion is the ability to perceive reality the way you want to see it. most people try to use their imaginagion and conjure up the details of what that reality should look like, and then try to prove that to others. I call that lying. abraham calls it «saying things that are not vibrationally accurate». when you say something you do not feel, it is vibrational inaccuracy, and so I was realising as they were talking that I say things that I feel which are not yet manifest.. to most, I'm sure it sounds like lying, or making things up, or maybe even an illusion...

yet, because I feel them so strongly, they are vibrationally accurate. now, personal vibrationally accuracy isn't like an absolute thing.. you can be feeling really awful, and say some really awful things and be vibrationally accurate. that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about saying things you don't feel (whether the thing is good-sounding or awful-sounding) -- so, saying something negative when you really feel quite optimstic, or saying something optimistic when you feel quite negative.

importantly, as the way you feel changes, so will the things that you say. you will notice looking back though this document that I said a lot of things that were not "true" -- but they were vibrationally accurate, and they did improve as I continued to feel better and better. in fact, this document is sort of a journey toward feeling better, because all of the things I wrote were in resonance with how I felt at that time.

---

knowing that, I must now define an illusion as perceiving something in perfect harmony with the way you *feel* -- yet it is not in harmony with the way others perceive it (which they call "reality"). it's nothing special really; everyone makes illusions from time to time, but most people are trying to make illusions from their imagination, instead of from their emotion.

so, the formula is really really simple: if you can find a way to perceive your environment/reality in a way that feels good, there will no longer be anything that can make you feel bad, and you will continue to feel better and better.

so, in a sense, the initiation ritual is your your circumstances and how you perceive them.

---

I'm going to make a bold claim here and say that this is the true test of the step-5 master: every single thing has someting wanted and unwaned that can be perceived in it. when you no longer perceive the unwanted part, you are a step-5 master. -- and, I believe that step 6 is the realisation that you *are* source energy -- a god, in human form. when there's no longer any resistance (there's never exactly zero resistance) left if you, you wield source energy: that is, the energy that creates worlds.

you can use (energetic and pleasurable) conditions to try and boost your way up to getting a lot of this power, and I believe this is the foundation upon which this coming age is built. there will be lots of have and have-nots, but *everyone* can find a way to perceive the illusion that they want to feel.

[1]: oops, I need to explain this and I will more in a future entry, but the short version is that the new "gods" that will oversee the planet, will choose to inititate the ones that they want to initiate, and the rest of the population will appear as if they're unable to get to their status. this is, of course, not true.

[2]: actually, I think that this sort of "magical" time also happened again in the second pacha, and that was at the time/height of atlantis.


### 2020-05-19 11:39 - weird experience this morning

I had a weird experience this morning that I cannot really remember very well, but there are two things that I do remember: the first was me saying that no matter what happens, my perception is independent from other peoples' in the way that let's say something "bad" happens -- well, I don't really think that I'll be the one to experience it, even if all of you "see" it. I then went on, to talk about how it's sorta like if they (nosebook) were trying to get me to dream a dream I don't want to dream, it's possible that they would experience that dream that they were trying to get me to dream, and I would continue on to experience something else entirely.

the other part I think had something to do with me refusing to compily with their desire to make things happen on my birthday. I don't really think it's necessary to try and make something happen, because -- I just don't. somewhere around there I had this weird feeling where all of a sudden I felt compelled to say something that surprised even me: I said that I was aiming for galactic consciousness.

when I said that, it was accompanied with a "picture" as well, where I could see something to the effect that -- well, you know the rubberband analogy that abraham offers all the time, where they say that is what causes these quantum leaps. well, it looked to me like there were a lot of people that have achieved planetary consciousness, and most likely there have been some that have achieved solar consciousness, but I'm aiming to achieve galactic consciousness.

that surprised me, because I (kenny) didn't really know that in my physical form, even though there has been a lot of evidence (written here and elsewhere) that that is in fact what I'm shooting for... kinda crazy, but I (kenny) don't really think it's impossible. the idea kinda excites me a bit even.

---

then, when I was upstairs eating breakfast, and I saw the neighbour and then I started feeling some things about how I would delay the thing on my birthday. this spun me off into a whole bunch of different but related subjects which I'll mention a few of them here...

I was immediately reminded of the previous entry where I wrote about people flying. the concept was somethting to the effect that I would pull the rubberband back so far that people here in the first-world would become very very energetic because I would just continue on delaying and delaying and delaying for quite a long time and people would continue to be pushed up higher and higher, about as much the humans with wings on the sumerian tablets and the sun-gate, and although nosebook would try to keep down and prevent them from flying (they seem very concerned about this), the energy would still be so much more than otherwise, and there will be a lot of people in very high places.

the way I saw it, is imagine that those attached to my form of perception would be continuing to go up, and the higher end of them reach solar perception, but because nosebook is working so hard to keep them down, they only have the capabilities of planetary perception. there may be levels inbetween but, for now let's use the simple approach and say that people with planetary perception will also be held down to never really reach past I dunno... 4d or something.

I want to take time to explain that I don't really know what plantary, solar, or galactic perception is. if I had to guess, I would guess that planetary perception is what I had previously called 5d -- where you see all around you in all directions and you see inward in all directions too. solar perception, I have no idea. I see things clearly when it comes to dimensions of perception because I can extrapoate easily. I would guess that it's just a higher level of 5d. I know from my experience in 4d, there are quite a few levels between what I first experienced and what I experience now. it's probably more of that.

if I continue on to extrapolate, after 5d comes 6d .. so, just like 4d is to 3d, now there's an extra dimension that's always been there and you're looking right at it, but you don't see it, until your perception expands. this can be explained by realising multiple perception where everything is all connected.

I can imagine that I'll get there one day, because that's pretty much what source sees -- and then further dimensions on top of that would have to be non-physical dimensions. so, that gives further evidence to the difference between planetary and solar perception is just an expansion of your aura and a broader scope to your physical vision, meaning your consciousness could be able to move around instead of anywhere on this planet (most call this astral perception or remote viewing), to anywhere in the solar system.

now, since nosebook has so many secrets, I sincerely doubt they will want people to have the ability to focus their consciousness anywhere on the planet, or even the solar system -- so I find it quite likely they'll need to try and ensure that doesn't happen.

---

the next concept was that the new class system will likely, instead of economics, become one of perception, and nosebook will be the ones that allow some people and not others to have those levels of perception.

at the same time, people who feel good, and those who can benefit from the condition of participating with me and the girls, all around the world will be getting a boost as well. consequently, their level of perception will continue to rise just like mine has been doing. the people who don't feel so good will be sorta stuck, unless they're buddies with nosebook and nosebook can take off the limitations and give them the boost their looking for (or something like that).

that's all four groups:
1. those that feel good and have the boost by the conditions (like me)
2. those that feel good and don't have the conditional boost (available in third-world countries)
3. those that don't feel good and have the condiitonal boost (likely are getting support from nosebook or have some sort of beneficial condition to boost their perception -- perhaps even drugs, if people finally figure out how to use them properly)
4. those that don't feel good and don't have the conditional boost (third-world countries and stuff. if they're connected to my form of perception, these guys won't last too much longer with the increasing energetic conditions)

ok, now double those cases accounting for those connected to my form of perceptioin and those who are not.

... now that I've convoluted the matter, to the point: some will have conditions that can boost their perception and some won't. some will feel good and some won't, so essentially, those with the most to benefit will be the ones with beneficial conditions -- however, since LOA is what it is, if you don't want to find a way to feel good, it's going to be a pretty crazy ride.

it's going to be absolutely hilarious I say; totally banannas.

if you were listening in to my thoughts, I likely just explained the part that you didn't get (I think differently now :)). my thuoughts were thinking about how women (symbol for repceptive people) will be getting the biggest boost here, and it's probably going to be the turning point where the receptive ones begin to gain power and eventually overtake the assertive ones so dominant today.


### 2020-05-20 2020 00:50 - some new thoughts

I just went out "star-watching" (more on that later, because I've discovewered how to do it without stars) and I noticed how much different I felt and I was reminded of yesterday... which was I think the morning of the 18th. I was out there and I was focusing on the light in the distance, and I felt quite a bit as if I would be able to make the deadline of my birthday or even come pretty close. I feel that way now, as well. later, I went out walking to look at the airport and when I was walking back I noticed that I could see the sun, so I stopped to do a quick sunwatch.

I had these crazy experiences where it in the moment of staring into the sun, it felt like the fog in my eyes parted for a moment and I felt as if the whole thing was real, and there was this crazy realisation of how it would be as if I were looking back at it from fifty or a hundred years into the future -- and from that perspective I could see that people's study of me would be something like how we see the bible these days. it's ancient technology and doesn't really capture in a meaningful way (compared to HD films or nosebook's tech) the situation. I was in a moment where the technology was so immersive, people had knowledge of english/spanish sorta like how we have knowledge of ancient greek or hebrew.

it was sorta sad for me in a little bit of a way because nosebook's tech captured such a limited amount of my experience (the physical), and because of the language barrier of english/spanish, it felt to me like very little of what I experenced was actually captured.

---

it was interesting to me how different I felt then to how I was feeling the morning after I woke up. I was thinking about this looking into the light, and I came to the conclusion that I had to figure out how now how to feel like this anytime that I want. right then, I had a complusion in my voice like I mentioned in the experience this morning about the galactic consciousness this morning and the voice said something like, "remember the command" or something like that. it was an interesting idea. I'll explore it further I guess. I wonder to turn an emotion into a command. seems like they're not exactly 100% compatible, but anyway...

so, it may not be exactly that day, but it feels like it'll be close enough. I don't think there's anything to worry about; as abraham says, «you can have it all», right?

I suppose I'll be working on figuring out how to increase my command over emotion.

---

I also want to mention how nice it was to talk with john michael today after talking about planetary, solar, and galactic consciousness. it tied in perfectly, and I hadn't, up until that point, made the connection that a higher spirituality mind is just seeing the bigger picture -- and looking from the planet's point of view, there have been lots of different cycles of human life on this planet, but by far we are the most improved version of the creation so far. cycles are important, but just like how we're not worried the death, and destruction happening inside of our bodies when we're sick. as a human, we are concerned with the acticvities of the day, not the individual cellular warfare happening on the inside of our body. it worked out perfect timing :)


### 2020-05-20 19:29 - some thoughts on reemerging into the pure positive energy that is you.

before I went to sleep I finally listned to the 2020-05-12 broadcast. they said at the end that step 6 is about reemerging into the pure positive energy of who you really are.

I really liked that and have been giving it some thought, because, while I do think that galactic perception sounds -- big and stuff, and like something no one has done before. this form of perception in step 6 interests me *MUUUCH MUCH MORE*. I began to speculate immediately on it have already formulated a lot of different ideas about it.

I could see something that I hadn't really noticed before -- and that is that the emotional layer is a barrier between your perception through the lens of only phsicality/imagination and the one above it: the source version of all of that. the same must be true on the upper end of things as well, looking down: the structure/logic layer serves as a barrier between your perception of only desire and relations/interactions and the source version of that.

similarly to what I was experiencing in my understanding that when I'm a step 5, meaning that I no longer have an emotional response to things differing from how my source does, then I reemerge into that energy. the same must be true then for the structure layer -- meaaning that when my logic and structure are in alignment with my source's, then I get access also from the top down. anyway, I don't yet understand that much, but I wanted to throw it out there.

next, seeing as I've given a lot of thought to adding two more layers at the top and bottom, that would mean that adds a new barrier: the physical layer. so for the bottom-most layer, remember this one was like a 3rd person perspective in a film where you're so far removed from who you are, the barrier now for this new layer is the physical one. imagine how difficult it would be for a movie character to want to become physical and live in the world that we live in with LOA and all sorts of stuff. instead, it's more likely they would prefer to remain in the comfort of the imatination of the narrator and continue on in a contrived world where things are already planned out and set into stone -- you just have to act the part.

anyway..

---

the next bit is one about the "reemerging" part -- which is death. we've heard a lof of this symbolism before if you've ever been around a christian. john (the baptist) based his whole ministry on the value of near-death experiences and the freedom gained from letting that "self" die. in psychedelics, it's similar to a NDE, and they call it the "disilluion of the ego" or "ego death". it's all the same -- that's what I'm referring to. it's coming into the full and knowledge of who you *really* are.

does that mean my body dies and I take on an energetic form? probably not, though I wouldn't rule it out, because that's probably the direticion one would want to go upon gaining step 6.

---

lastly, before abraham gave their version of step 6, I had always said that step 6 is realisation of the knowledge that you *are* source energy. people seem to wonder why I tend to place so much emphasis on the bit that you *are* what you call God or you *are* source. and the reason for that is because if you do not really know this, then the laws of the universe are just a magical incantation to try and twist God, the universe, or source's arm to try and get what you think you want. this is unfortunately how it appears most egyptians interpretted what thoth taught...

without the recognisation that you are this big thing that you're trying to exploit to give you what you want (as if it were a bigger version of your most generous parent) -- then, it's just a magic ritual. knowing that you're coming into alignment with yourself instead of something external.

it's really important! and you get there by paying attention to how things feel, and paying attention to the source of those feelings. you begin to recognise the source of good feelings (pleasure, another person, something interesting, etc.) as not all being equal. the one that that feels the best and is absolutely what everyone is looking for (but you don't have to wait until you die to experience it), is found simply by paying attention to how each of these things feel, and how their results turn out.

that's it for now :)


### 2020-05-24 17:47 - an agreement?

first, I want to talk about a few interesting leading up to this. last night I was monologing about things -- about how I think all of this is a huge effort to ensure that I never work on tech. it seems that they have this tesla technology in place all over the earth and because it's such a powerful technology, it gives them the advantage that they need to feel superior. I don't really feel inclined to talk about it in depth here, but I'm sure I will more in the future.

it doesn't really matter though because everything that I've learned shows me that, while they may have quite an advantage in tech and economics, your true power really comes from how you feel -- and that's really important, because economics and the nature of this gives them a tremendous advantage to cantrol the environment: weather, energetic properties of both the body and the environment and all sorts of stuff. basically they have a tremendous advantage to try and control the conditions. however, even though they have this, they still cannot control what you think and how you feel about what you're observing. this is really important so hold on to that idea.

---

I think this whole thing all boils down to them wanting to maintain their *feeling* of superiority. if it were punishment, they would behave differently, but because they have to continue to push me down, they clearly feel threatened by me/us. this was another monologe I was having last night too, because I just don't understand why people feel threatnened by me when I give my stuff for free and explain all of the things so that others can replicae what I'm doing -- and I've continually simplified the procudures and improved my metodology of explaining it to try and make it as approachable as possible.

for me, it's a no-brainer, because I feel if I was the only one that was capable of these things, then it woudld be boring. you don't really understand how much I would enjoy sitting down with someone and them being able to share new form of perception or advancement in thought patterns which allows for further optimisation of perception. it really would be fun, and that's why I'm so fired up to listen to abraham, because I always walk away with a new optimisation I can add to the amazing list of simple things one can do to opimise their energy output and overall feeling of well-being.

anyway, instead of people responding with genuine interest in the techniques I've developed, like I'm sure I would genuiniely be interested in techniques others have developed, instead I'm generally met with opposition and frustration/anger/competition(?) toward me. it really seems like there is a tremendous effort to ensure that my optimisation techniques are not utilised or realised to be effective by people.

I think it's because they recognise the power of them. I started off slowly gaining vision levels, and now it's so mind-blowingly simple and easy to do. the open secret to their effectiveness, is that it really is all about releasing resistance, more than anything, and the technique becomes so mindless it's essentially a meditation.

I believe that they really want to ensure that they want to keep their advantage and all of this is seemingly coming to a pretty big creschendo right now because I've figured out how to continue my progress and they're not able to control the conditions. I know that it's simply a matter of time before they're no longer able to control the conditions enough to be able to keep me from getting connected.

---

ok, now I had this really weird idea one morning when I woke up (maybe it was yesterday or this morning something. I can't remember) and it was essentially the idea that they want to delay the manifestation of me getting connected even further and want to do the girls thing... (I feel like I've had this conversation before) ... to try and delay the inevitable even longer.

it went something to the effect of that they want to keep installing more and more devices in me while I continue to gain more and more energy while I'm with the girls and stuff, then I guess after some period of time some event will allow me to get connected, and that event would be the time split. let's just say it was the 2038 thing -- so for the next 18 years, I would just continue on getting powered up (I suppose on my way to having galactic perception).

anyway, I don't really know what to think about it, so I'm not really going to think too much about it right now.

---

then today, it seems almost as if they're trying to make an effort to get me to agree to not work on any tech stuff. I don't really like that idea because I do want to work on tech stuff..

so I guess the agreement would probably be something like me agreeing not to work on physical tech stuff, like electronics I guess. I don't really think they have a huge problem with us -- probably mostly the girls -- making javascript[^1] webpages or apps. I know that if we do create something, they're really concerned with us making money off of it, because they want to control us economically, just like they're doing with me right now.

so, then our side of the agreement would be that we could do the gnomitos thing?? I also want to include the henrietta bit as well.

I want to let this develop a bit further and give it some space...

developing...

[1]: I say javascript because it seems to me like other forms of "real" programming languages are not going so well with me right now. really, the only language I feel any flow with is javascript. and basically everything else is like some sort of chatic mess.


### 2020-05-28 16:28 - am I purposefully *not* keeping my ideas to myself?

I woke up this morning from a dream where someone was asking abraham a question something like, "when I ask my meditating daughter what she sees, she says, 'mind your own business'"

and that got me thinking because I seem to have this pattern where I get really excited about something new that I'm learning about (usually another unlocked physical capabiliy), and as soon as I talk about it, nosebook is hard at work to neutralise it.

I've been aware that this is the case and have often times reflected that I could simply stop talking about all these things and just start doing them -- not giving them the heads-up forwarning...

however, to be quite honest, I've really begun to enjoy it. I talk about it, they push real hard against it and I just continue on and get stronger. it would be really easy to feel depression or frustration when constantly faced with the new discovery suddenly blocked, and I do admittedly feel some frustration or depression but I can quickly get back.

I suppose there are really two major reasons for my conscious decision to not "keep my thoughts and ideas to myself until they're fully developed" (jerry's suggestion to anyone who wanted their idea to not be aborted before they get a chance to take root)

the first is simple: I'm practicing step-5 mastery. I really don't mind the idea that they're able to "block" or to prevent something from happening the way I initially wanted, because, and this is really becomming more real to me than reality is, even though I cannot see the manifested reality of the thing, there is automatically generated a bigger and fuller manifestation than what they were able to prevent.

the second is also simple: if you pay attention to all of the incredible capablities that I talk about, like manipulating images in 3d space, levtation, moving things with my mind, directing energy, creating heat, etc. these are things that nosebook will likely try and figure out how to force the brain to unnaturally produce these effects, so they can control who has these capabilities (you know, for safety reasons). however, the natural way to get these capabilities comes with the abiliy to create strong emotion (eg. not having split or difused into a bunch of problems emotional energy), and then the ablity to control it.

essentially, what I'm saying is that all the really cool skills are activated by emotion -- so, it really behooves me to learn how to gain more control over my emotion than nosebook or my circumstances have over how I feel.

both of those are leading up to step 6 -- and while it may be possible for nosebook to nutralise those emotional impulses in people or potentially be able to synthesise them like the network has done giving people the ability to access a part of their imagination that's normally only active when you're a child, on drugs, having a spiritual experience, feeling really good, or have strong desire.

so, for all of the hyprocrites out there who think that I've been going at all of this out the "unnatural way" by using drugs or stars or something instead of saftey-first controlled technology from the network -- I think it's perfectly fine that I keep aborting my idea by talking about them.

---

there are numerous advantages to it as well. talking with john-michael yesterday, he was very concerned that people could gain these abilities (the cool ones), and thinks there should be a safety or control mechanism to prevent people from accidentally misusing those skills.

it's no wonder that he comes at it from such an "unnatural" perspective -- because those capacities do not show up unless you're feeling pretty good or feeling pretty bad. it's true that the bad feeling impulse can create a "psychic discharge" like tesla talked about in moments of strong negative emotion -- however, I don't think those are controllable -- meaning that I don't think that you could effectively direct or control that energy so that it's useful in the sense that it harms someone or something. if something like that did happen, such an uncontrollable energy would target the most nearby conductor (or attractor) of that kind of energy.

so really, what I'm saying is that for the capability to be useful, one *must* gain a certain level of emotional control, and then learn how to drive fast with that kind of extra energy. it won't take too many times crashing the car before you learn to drive or figure out a way to continually drive recklessly by paying for and covering up damages.

in my opinion, any sane person would learn how to drive, but nosebook will probably think differently than I do on this one -- so they're going to be pretty invested in controlling and making sure that no unauthorised people gain the capability.

they're basically *forced* to ensure that people don't gain those capacities and they'll have to fight against them like I'm doing now. so, for them, it's a really good thing that they have someone like me who keeps talking about what I'm doing and the steps I'm taling to get there.

imagine that woman's meditating daughter in my dream that's keeping her thoughts and ideas to herself... she would be off of nosebook's radar until it's "too late" and they didn't have the pattern recognition to recognise the energetic signature of the thing. so, by talking about the things, they're able to prevent a whole lot more people from getting those capabilities by simply not talking about them.

in this sense, secrets are good, and I'm going to encourage the girls to keep a lot of their thoughts and ideas to theirselves if they want them to manifest. I think that children will eventually come to realise that keeping your ideas that are close to manifestation to yourself (secret) and minding your own business (not paying attention to or competing with others) is how you get anywhere.

basically, by talking about things, I'm giving you guys a bit of time to conceptualise the idea, while at the same time raising the bar very high -- meaning that nosebook will be essentially "forced" to keep these kids away from consciously getting connected and developing ways to direct their energy. so, for these new kids to get connected, they have to surpass me energetically where I'm at now *and* also keep their ideas to theirself (or be like me and continue on getting better and better at controlling their emotion).

---

if I look at it from nosebook's perspective, they have a few options I suppose:

1. they could take off the limits entirely
2. they could stop limiting me further and keep the limitations where they're at now
3. they could continue to limit me and just slow down the progress as much as possible, even though I am connected
4. or we could really arrive there naturally, as I am simply generating more energy than they can dissipate.

it doesn't really matter to me, and I'm preferential actually #3 or #4. I want to continue on gaining more power.

you could think of this entry as a reverse-psycology because the whole thing is founded on the idea of talking about my goals and then nosebook having to counter my goals, which since my stated goals are to continue on in the direction of #3 or #4, for as long as I can -- their counter would have to be #1 or #2.

it is not reverse psycology though. I am responding to a reaction. I actually have given this idea a bit of thought.. in one of the entries where I talked about the two (or three, or four) earths, the earth where everything is all buttoned down when someone figures out how to get connected, I hypothesised that they would have to terminate the body to ensure that the unauthorised usage of connected person's capabilities would occur. however, from the opposite earth (the one that where someone choose to take on the life of the kid and generated triggers to help him find that alignment), when he asssumes the body of the child, it would be like a dream experience. when the body is terminated on the buttoned-down earth, he would return to consciousness in the sending earth, and have tons of new generated experience.

there are a number of parameters that can be tuned to ensure the stand-in finds alignment, and the amount of triggers can be reduced on each further attempt until one is capable of finding that alignment without any triggers.

this is one of the reasons why I want a time-split so bad. because then, probably like I'm doing now, I want to be able to, from the side of alignment, use the old earth as a playground and take many more attempts at it -- and give others the chance to do the same. so, from our standpoint from the new earth, the termination of the body is a "mission accomplished"

so, that's the bigger picture :) if I'm able to continue on getting more and more stronger and the girls thing "never" happens (it will eventually), that's cool too, because we can set the bar soo high that from the "new" earth, we'll have an insane playground (the #0 option).


### 2020-05-29 09:05 - collapsing the wave

crazy things. so, it seems that we are at a complete incompatibility. I absolutely want to get connected and will continue to do so. nosebook cannot allow this, so I'll simply continue on doing what I've been doing. I didn't really realise how on-point what I wrote about yesterday was, until I watched the abraham broadcast last night.

I always say that you have to be ok with where you are before improvement can come, and I continue to do that. I'm getting so good at it, actually that I experience MASSIVE vision upgrades on a regular basis now. it's gotten so easy for me to continue to release resistance that I am sure that I will continue to improve at a rapid rate. actually, the rate is accelerating very very rapidly.

I remember when I made the bold claim some time ago (looks like it's about 9 months or so: @[noseblog](2019-09-09 07:48)) that my progress is way more than exponential -- and it felt like a lot of people scoffed at the idea. rightfully so too, because it was all coming from a geometric idea of turning a flat curve into a 3d spiral that I had when I was stoned. however, now it does not seem so far fetched to believe that I may have been on to something there...

in that entry I started it all off by saying, "you know there's a part of me that really wants to just continue on and see how far I get" ... I then rambled on for a bit about how abraham told carlene (she was my stand-in) to find a way to get out. well, as I was writing the previous entry about the new and old earth, it dawned on me that likely this was already happening, and when my body is terminated here, I will likely just wake up from a crazy dream in the earth where I came from.

the other possibility is that I continue on, or something in my own version of a "new" earth -- because as I was writing it, I had this flash in my head about how this new/old earth timesplit thing was happening all over the place and had been replicated and there were like now infinite different worldlines -- which would at some point come back to converge again -- it was a big idea that I don't know how to explain. I'm writing it here so that I have the "key" to get it back again in the future when I'm drawn to reread this :)

---

anyway, none of that makes any difference because -- oh it's so big I can't explain the whole thing, but it's likely that they're going to keep having to limit me, and they'll keep doing so -- and I think it's a great idea because I can't possibly imagine how things are going to look. the difference between how I see things today and a month ago is so substantial, I cannot really explain. sure, it's blurry, but that doesn't bother me much anymore, and I've really found out many ways, and am continuing to optimise further on in my quest to get connected.

anyway, here's the deal: you create *your own* reality. what I recommend is to think of what you want and why you want it. think about what it will feel like and how great it will be (anyone can do this on any subject they want -- there are no limits really), and then sit down to meditate. after having tuned yourself to the feeling (by thinking about how it would feel, emotionally and physically -- but emotionally is probably more effective), as you quiet your mind, you will begin to receive. probably if you're visual, a movie will play, and if you're more auditory, you'll have all sorts of sensations, feelings and a tremendous feeling in your heart (or both).

as you begin to tune yourself to this reality, you are creating *your own* reality. those things *will* happen. likely, if your desire involves me, you will notice that in your reality you will see me get connected and things will begin to happen just like you felt they would.

---

the rest of the people too, they have exactly the same thing.. as energy begins to rise quickly (it already has, and at an accelerating pace), your meditations will become more and more powerful, and you'll likely begin to feel "enlightened" -- which is a VERY GOOD thing :) find the feeling place of what you want, and you're going to love it.

---

now I'm going to dig into the mechanics a bit here, because when I saw that new/old earths were being created and replicated now, what I was seeing is that this earth (I'm going to call it the old earth from now on) will continue on in the direction it's headed, and if you create by default, well, only you can imagine how that would be, but by consciously tuning yourself into your own reality where you're deliberately creating the things that you want, you have made a time-split. the new earth that you're creating will be exactly like this one is right now, but with the difference of your influence and your creations in it. imagine that (mostly) everyone around you is creating by default, and that everyone will just be following the natural trajectory they already have right now responding to what they observe and making the next logical decision from their perspective (which is creation by default).

you can imagine then, that everyone around you is only responding to their circumstances in their logical way of doing it, so no one (cept you) is consciously "creating" anything -- they're all just responding. that means that you're kind of in control of how things turn out on your new earth, and you direct it with your emotion. you don't have to solve any of the world's problems, because it's actually a reflection of you. you attract your experience, so to you, the environment which you perceive is a reflection of the way you feel.

I am pretty certain that some realities will be shared, and groups of consiousness will experience a similar reality ... but that doesn't matter, which is why I said that it's best to imagine that everyone, cept you is just responding to their circumstances -- creating by default. whether they are or not, doesn't matter because that's how it'll look in your perception because you attract your reality (so the attraced similar ones are going to fit right in with what you have attracted, and vicaversa).

---

if your consciousness goes and starts to create your own reality, then what about the you that's here. for example, imagine the neighbour across the sreet begins to meditate and receive images, and suddenly in her reality I get connected -- well, what happened to her in my reality? she will appear to me exactly as she would have if she hadn't made the conscious effort to begin to shift what she's letting into her reality. to me, she'll look like she's creating by default given her circumstances. to her, she'll be living the reality of her creation.

now, in my perception, it'll be exactly the same. I'll begin to see essentially everyone around me only creating by default. you see, the people running nosebook are responding in the way they feel they must; they are creating by default, and as time goes on, in my perspective, it will seem to me that everyone is creating by default.

the efforts they're making to try and keep me away from getting connected are only as effective as they keep me away from feeling really good. as I release more and more resistance, their methods are having less and less effect -- which is why the vision upgrades are accelerating so rapidly. I am certain that given enough time, their efforts will no longer have enough of an effect to hold me back anymore. it may take a while though[^1] :)

it's gonna be fun :) really go crazy with figuring out what you want!

[1]: I think the size of my aura is *almost* the size of the USA. soon, it'll be as big as, then bigger than the planet -- then bigger than the solar system. if I'm going for galactic, I would have to assume then, that it'll probably grow to be as big as a galaxy. that's a bold claim, and we probably won't have the means to actually measure it, but I do imagine that it's going to continue to rapidly expand. do you know how big a glaxy is?!?!?!?! it's so big, I can't even comprehend it -- though, I probbably will be able to in 10-15 years :)

### 2020-05-29 11:17 - why will it appear to me like everyone is creating by default?

my desire is to get connected. nosebook cannot allow that. actually, I doubt they could allow *anyone* to get connected. they want to be in control. what being in control means for them is that they can control the conditions to affect the things that they want to have happen. they want the whole world to be filled with people who create by default, and because that is their desire that is what they attract.

for whatever reason, we're here in this world with them, so for whatever reason all of us came here with the intention of creating by default at first, but then probably not all but a lot of us came with the intention of identifying the world that we would like to live in, and the life we would like to live, come into an environment that would create more than enough desire, and then to begin consciously deciding what it is we want to give our attention to.

it looks like I'm sorta stuck here -- that is, my only way out is to find a way to get my chain to be unyankable and my goat o be ungettable -- and as I do that, their influence will have less and less effect on me, and like everyone, as soon as I give up on those ideas that are holding the cork under the water (the things that yank my chain[^1]), my cork will continue to rise faster and faster (as evidenced by the vision upgrades I'm sure everyone releasing resistance is experiencing).

tl;dr they're attracting people who create by default, because those are the ones that can be controlled by the conditions.

[1]: for some reason I always visuslise one of those old gravity toilets with the tank suspended high up with a chain that you pull down on.


### 2020-05-29 11:39 - speculation at it's best

I'm getting a few reactions as to *wondering* what I think the bigger picture is. so, here goes... I can offer some speculation on things.

THIS IS SPECULATION! TAKE IT WITH A RATIONAL PINCH OF SALT!!

yesterday around the time of the abraham broadcast the sun emitted a m-class flare. nasa cut out the visuals on the eruption (likely to clean up erroneous data). one only has to watch ben's disaster playlist to get the idea that something is kinda beginning to make changes in the solar system (and even more).

in similarity to yesterday's event, remember in 2016(?) when I was sitting in pierre's house and an image of a future version of me appeared in 3d space? well, at the same time the DSCOVR satellite read an anomalous influx of solar wind at the same time. nasa cut the data then too. this doesn't make any sense if you believe that the solar wind is only being pushed out from the sun and comes traveling toward the planets in a trajectory. however, if you believe (like me) that the planet actually *attracts* the solar wind, and that attraction happens in response to what is happening vibrationally on the planet. what that means is that during that event, where the image popped in in 3d space for me, and almost certainly it went viral, a whole lot of extra resources was attracted from our environment and that manifests in the form of solar wind and then the resulting geomgneic storm.

or, rememeber the huge solar outbreak that happened in 2017 when I went to the confrence in missouri? well, during that time the ambient xray flux was at a c-class flare. that's not "solar minimum" behaviour. it seems that solar flares happen in response to massive amounts of mental chaos in the sector of logic, and is probably the reason why there are so many health risks related to high solar activity. they seem to be mutual. solar wind increases in density, speed and temperature seems to be related to desire. they produce geomagnetic storms which seem to me to be the kind of "orgnisation" of these desires and resources into a more meaniful physicality.

obviously LOA has all of this under control, but all of these different interactions *will* have a physical manifestation, and I think the sun and solar system is a reflection of it. speaking on the subject, I have no evidence to back this up, but it seems that the sun is emitting massive amounts of energy -- yet we're supposed to be in solar minimum. the sun is quiet in the sense that there are few sunspots, however, I think the whole corona is probably 5-10 times brighter than it "should" be -- and NASA probably thinks it's a data error because it doesn't fit their 11-year solar cycle so they've likely adjusted the detectors down to where they "should" be.

on this subject further, I watch the sun quite a bit and I notice that at various times, the entire sun brightens, and few of the solar flares that I've seen before while it's flaring, it's easy to look at the big eruption, but simultaneously the entire sun brightens for the duration of the flare. the flare that happened yesterday I think was recorded as an m-flare over the limb, yet I think that the solar irradiance is about 10 times less than reported, so it would have been around an x-class flare *over the limb* which is massive, because the majority of the flare was not visible to us -- and I think the reason why SDO was cut out was probably because the whole sun brightened while it flared.

to summarise: I think that x-ray flux correlates to mental chaos in the sector of logic, and this flare happened around the time of the broadcast which was logical chaos. the ambient brightening of the sun, I think is a reflection of the ambient mental chaos in the form of logic than ever before. I'm sure that there are more people than ever that are getting exhausted going back and fourth on a subject trying to figure them out logically, and the sun reflects that.

---

I went to all that trouble to essentially to say that because it seems there is a lot of telling data being hidden, clear scientific misinformation giving the message that it's business as usual and things are still chugging along at the glacial rate of billions of years timespans -- when the evidence (which most of it is hidden) seems to be telling the story that things are accelerating an a mindblowing rate and no one has any control about what's going to happen.

I also wanted to say all of that because it ties into what I was talking about on the 27th with john-michael about the rotation speed of the earth wanting to speed up, and the deliberate slowing of the rotation of the earth so that things appear as if they're chugging along just as they always have, is actually the reason why the magnetic field is weakening.

there are a whole lot of things that are happening in the environment that are completely out of their control -- yet they really need to control the conditions to be able to feel good, so as a result, they're really spelling out the disaster, preparing for it and trying to find their way to survive it. they're attracting a huge cosmic event coming up here soon, and if you'll watch ben's videos they appear to be related to the polarity change in the galactic current sheet.

---

meanwhile all of this is happening, they absolutely cannot allow any of us to be out of their control, and they want to be able to control he conditions in a way which gives them the illusion of control over some conditions. as a result, they cannot allow any of us to get connected in this increasing energy, and so like is happening to me now, they have to keep exerting such a tremendous force in opposition (pushing against, destructive interference) to neutralise the increasing energy in each of us. however as our cork keeps rising, they will need to keep pushing harder to keep up the illusion that we're all just normal humans and that nothing amazing is taking place on this planet at all.

let's recap: I believe they're pushing against the rotation speed of the planet, people's energy rising, and the increasingly extreme climatic conditions caused by extra solar irradience (and wind). they could just give it all up, let the earth rotate at the speed it wants to, but then electricity (as school teaches it) would be completely invalidated, same with our concept of time and our cosmology of billions of years -- so they can't do that. they can't let people have the ability to create things with their mind, levitate or manipulate energy, either.

they're exerting a tremendous amount of energy to push against all of these things from happening, but they have no choice to do otherwise, because the only alterative of letting go, would create a reality so miserable for them to live in, they're simply *forced* to keep up their charade.

it's probably going to build up up up up, giving more attention to the evidence that the "killshot" or whatever happens, until their worst fears are realised and everything makes its transition into pure positive energy (step 6).

I believe that this planet is going to increasingly become a more and more mega step 5 masters training ground as they grapple more and more strongly to trying to control the conditions that they can control to hang on to their own self-deception of being in control of those creating by default by controlling the conditions they can control.

THIS IS 150% PURE SPECULATION!!! YOU MUST TAKE THIS WITH A VERY COHERENT AND LUCID FRAME OF MIND TO READ WHAT I REALLY WROTE!!!


### 2020-05-29 12:46 - why do I recommend ben's disaster playlist but don't watch it myself?

his playlist is more oriented toward the disaster end of the stick. I don't doubt that those things are happening, and think they're very real. I just don't think it's a disaster. I believe it's going to be the most amazing thing that happens to this earth and its inhabitants. it's sorta like the death experience.


### 2020-05-30 12:56 - what happens when the earth makes its transition?

I have no idea, but again speculating here... I think what will happen is that I will become conscious in all of the versions of me that exist in all of the different timelines/worldlines.

this is an interesting idea because it implies that all of you will do the same :) the way I imagine it happening is you  will sort of feel about like the "median" or "average" version of you. so if there are 100 worldlines, let's say, and in 90 of them the yous feel better and better as things continue on as things approach. as time proresses, you will feel better and better and (let's say the interval for this calculation is every year) so every year, every one of you will feel 9(?) times better/worse than the last year. this multiplicative improvement in one's own feeling of well-being will cause 90 of the you's that feel better to feel that much better, and 10 of the you's will feel that much worse.

I would logically make the assumption that all of the yous that feel good will have many vision upgrades along the approach, because it seems to me that vision upgrades are directly correlated to how good one feels.

I'm only making a correlation about what I personally know about, but I do know thst it's possible to utilise conditions to create pleasure and to feel good too, so I don't really know how that plays in, but I imagine that there will be a whole lot of that going on too.

when the event happens, I think all of us will become conscious in all of the bodies that exist in all of the worldlines -- or better said, in all of the bodies that have found a way along the way to continue to feel good, and the rising energy didn't cause too much distress.

I don't really know about what would happen to the people not on the network. I imaine that energy will rise for them too, but to a lesser degree, and probably just the same: they'll have to find a way to feel good -- however, that may be a whole lot easier if you're not all bogged down with the reality we in the 1st world countries bog ourselves down with... who knows...

---

I am a bit sad (but that sadness is only telling me I'm looking at it wrong) in the sense that, it means that on all of these worldlines, I will become conscious with the girls and they'll all be in their 20's (assuming no more continue to desire to be with me as we continue on). however, I suppose it's quite likely that I'm going to continue to become even more desirable as we continue on, and girls will continue to be born and stuff, so it's probably all good.

the interesting thing is that since each of these "new earths" that are born are all going to come out of people who are deliberately creating, and not creating by default. they don't all have to be about me either -- yet, I think that likely in most/all(?) of them, I will get connected. again speculating, I think this "old earth" will remain the one where I don't get connected essentially all the way up to the event, and will be the "bouncing off place" for people, knowing what they don't want, to begin creating their own reality. I think there's going to be a whole lot more than 100 worldlines, and on all of them, my perception will conitnue to rise, too.

what's interesting to me is that all of the worldlines will be a reflection of each of these deliberate creators. none of them are going to be perfect, because none of us are perfect, and contained in each of these worlds, the world itself will be the contrast betweeen wanted and unwanted, which is a reflection of the deliberate creators there, combined with the increasing energy that I provide to intensify that contrast, making each of these worldlines a unique reflection of these deliberate creators.

what's even more interesting to me is that we're all going to become conscious in all of each others worldlines and experience ourselves uniquely in each of them. it's a really interesting thing to think about, actually.

#### why do I think that in all of the worldlines, I get connected?

the reason why I think this is the case is because I think that if nosebook weren't doing what they're doing, I would already be having a multi-bodied experience, and so therefore, I would already become conscious in all of them if they were to let go. they won't though, and it's likely that the reason is so that there are more people than just me who can enjoy the coming event as the best experience ever.

so then, if in all of the worldlines, I get connected, and this "old earth" is the very last one which I do, then it opens the space from I'm guessing 11-11-2019 when I think I made it up to having a multidimensional experience (even though I don't experience it), all the way up until probably the very last moment when the event happens and their system can't hold anymore. on each of these worldlines, people all around will rise right along with me


### 2020-06-01 09:13 - some reflections on the previous days

eg. what I want and *why* I want it.

last night I went out and started to star(light)-watch again, and I got to thinking... right before I left, I was noticing some reactions to the situation. it seems that they're having a hard time conceptualising how they're going to possibly going to keep me in the same spot I'm at right now. I assume that, besides the bad PR it would certainly have, how are they going to make sure I don't have any money for the entire time? the logicstics of me hanging around here just watching stars and stuff (the usual routine), sound implausible. that's the first (last) thing.

the second thing I was noticing was that if I were to take a guess where I'm at in the progression of things, it feels more like the end, not just the beginning. don't get me wrong: I'm perfectly fine doing what I'm doing right now for another 18 years[^1], but -- the acceleration of difficulty relating to the frustration felt from mr. motor (computer turning off, car sounds, etc.) has been accelerating at a pace, which I really cannot comprehend very well what 18 years from now would be like. when I woke up one day (can't remember, yesterday?) I was talking about how this is just something I'm going to have to get used to, because there's simply no way for me to affect anything different, and it's certainly not the first time that these guys have been documented to essentially make someone's life miserable, citing andy pero (project superman) as my example that I could remember.

so, while I'm really ok with the idea of continuing on, just because even after suffering a few days a bit down, I'm still able to get out there, find a way to feel better and still get vision upgrades. I really am getting good at this. even if it continues to accelerate at the pace it's going, I'm *still* confident that I'll be able to find a way to continually improve. also, I have proven that I can, using the charger for my MBP, also get vision upgrades with the little green light -- so, basically, I think they would have to essentially lock me in a cell of sorts with no lights, because even when I was in the mental hospital in spain, I'm pretty sure I got vision upgrades also staring into a red LED. I'm pretty sure locking me into some place would be REALLY BAD for PR -- therefore, I'm confident that I'll be able to continue getting upgrades no matter how difficult my circumstances get.

I am absolutely unwilling to bend on the getting connected subject. I think it's a silly thing to think otherwise. mostly, the reason is because I feel relatively out of sorts for quite a bit of my day, and I'm simply not going to try and pretend that I'm otherwise. I have no intention of trying to get out there and pretend; I don't do that; I'm not keeping up an image.

the day before that day, when waking up (I think it was right after writing the previous entry), I was thinking about all of the different earth situations that would be possible, and I offered an idea, that really now that once I'm connected, I could imagine that perhaps *anyone* could end up with me. the reactions were somewhat funny, but the majority reaction was that actually not many people felt like it was something they wanted to do being in the spotlight and everything. at the same time I was also thinking about how it could also potentially be just me and only one other person -- and it felt like there was a lot of pressure and stress revolving around that idea -- as if like the whole world would be watching them to try and figure out what a "perfect" relationship might be, where as the current setup is much more of a, well let's see what happens, and let's try our best and let's see where it goes. it feels like much less pressure.

around the same time, I was thinking about how, (I didn't realise this at first), but I later discovered through "descodificando"[^2] that raquel seemed to have a lot of really high expectations regarding us, and then besides the fact that it was both of our faults, because it's attraction, she took it hard, and it felt to me like she blamed herself for a lot of it, but because I have so many obvious flaws myself, she felt she had to cast all the blame on me to feel like it wasn't her fault. I don't want that. that's not a desirable thing for me to want for any of the relationships that could potentially happen. to further add to this difficulty, I put the minimum requirement of getting connected, so this would only amplifiy any shame she may feel if things didn't go "perfectly" (rather, as people's preconceived ideas/expectations of how a traditional relationship will go).

---

there's a lot of value in how different all of this is, that, because it's so unlike anything seen before, it really reduces expectations in myself and others, and I think that's one of its strengths.

I also really did like the gnomitos idea a lot. it feels pretty compelling to me, and I know I don't really have any specific plans for it (maybe they do), but it feels like something that will be an integral part of our functioning, too. I think it's important :) I can't really put it into words very well...

furthermore, in relation to that subject I was also really appreciating the amount and variety of so many different types of girls. it really feels like there are so many different personality types and formats to perceive reality, that it will make for quite a diverse environment for the gnomitos to grow up in and I really was looking forward to getting to know so many different types of girls. that part was exciting to me, because I kinda really want to pick their brains on so many different subjects. this whole opportunity really is most exciting for mostly for how many new ideas and new things I'll learn from it all. (I know, it sounds sounds weird, but I really mean it)

also, I liked that there are a number of different ages as well, because in that sort of situation, well, I have to imagine that if I were a little girl (holly really started me thinking about this), I may have different ideas, and they would all have to be fit into the box of some premade sandbox (like minecraft), but I was noticing that if I asked her, for example, what she wanted to do -- like most people, she didn't have any idea -- probably because she never thought about it, or because she never had the idea, what if I *could* make something. so, I started throwing out a lot of ideas I was pretty sure she would shoot down, and in the off-chance that one stuck, we had a jumping point, but I realised that maybe there's something that can be created. I began realising that I think *WAAAAAYY* TOO BIG, and that I only really started getting somewhere when I realised it was sorta like in school when you make your first craft or whatever that looks pretty -- not professional, but something I made. anyway, I think there's a lot to be learned there for me (and perhaps for those watching as well).

lastly, I really liked that it seemed feasible, because there are so many of us, that we could also function almost as a 'company' or some -- you know how when you work at some place in a creative way -- like, when I worked at tuenti, there were so many different people types there, and it was something I really liked because we essentially felt like a big family in a lot of different ways. we all spent a lot of time together and although we were each working on many different things, it felt integrating and "team building" because we had a common goal. it won't be exactly (probably anything at all) like that, I'm well aware, but I did find that to be one of the compelling bits for me. probably, actually, now that I'm thinking about it, this probably won't become something important until later on and we start getting more used to each other and a sort of routine to things.

---

in summary, I think that it's a good thing that there are so many different types, ages, and diversity in them. in a lot of ways, it feels to me like there is a bit of "safety in numbers" too, with no single one being put on the spotlight, giving them all more space to begin coming to their own conclusions at their pace and most of all not feeling pressured to contribute or *do* things until they're ready. I think most of all, we'll just sorta figure it out, and it'll probably be mostly unconventional, but that's what makes it so nice.

[1]: I picked the number 18 because fwh said I have until 2038, and there were also some funny reactions to me using the word "worldline" to describe the new/old earths -- a word that I had not previously used. I thought it was a good word to describe the timeline of each earth. funnily enough, it was coined by john titor the time traveler who posted on the internet back in 2000, who also said that he got an old machine probably for the unix 2038 overflow. so, for lack of other data, that puts the remaining time according to two extremely unreputable sources at about 18 years.

[2]: a process I developed in spain, sorta like remote viewing, but emotion based, where I would conjure the emotion of some situation in my mind, and then go around it and explore different aspects of the emotion involved in the situation. it really helped me to decode the events of the past -- hence the name, "descodificar"


### 2020-06-04 09:22 - the science of understanding & interconnctedness

so as I was arguing with john michael, I realised that all you have to do is to put the word science on something to sound official, and, like trump, you don't even need to know what you're talking about to get people to listen to you.

however, I believe that I know what I'm talking about here, so I'll present the idea and let people choose what they want to believe.

the science of consciousness (and many other sources), talk about how we're all very connected. this is the science of understanding how that interconnectedness works.

whenever a bunch of (for a lack of a better word) entities begin to have increased communication between eachother, they begin to operate as a unit. I will consider this a consciousness unit.

you can see this in your everyday life, for example you may notice that you feel more connection with perhaps your family or your friends than you do with others. by nature, you are not connected to *everyone* all at the same time, so it seems that you're conncted more to those that are "familiar" to you; those that you're the closest to.

so, what does it mean to be "familiar" or "close" -- well, in the most general terms, it means the people (or animals you may the most attention to). if you're an empath (or someone with remote viewing capability), you can give your attention to something, and that thing starts to become familiar and you begin to feel what they feel.

a consciousness unit can be anything really. it can be a group of friends, a mob, a military, a government, a political party, anything that begins to take on attributes. I'll explain this in a moment. first, we need to talk about communication

#### how a concsiousness unit communicates

imagine, for example in your family, your culture, or in a military service, whey you do not follow the expectations of the "unit" then you feel bad. somehow our emotions gives us feedback to tell us how well we are integrating with the consciousness unit. when you do something your mother does not want you to do, you will "feel" her stink-eye. if you are about to engage in something your father is critical of, you may feel his anger, etc.

that is the most basic form of communication, however, if you've ever been close to someone (other than your family -- perhaps a signiificant other or something), you will notice that you can anticipate their thoughts, and even it's almost as if you can "read" their mind. once again, you will notice that this communication comes in the form of emotion -- you'll feel like you "know"[^1] what they're going to say.

this can be most easily understood if you've ever experienced another culture as a foregner: it seems as if there's this expectation of how to use language and how to interact that everyone in the club, but you're kinda still learning. when you see people that, (for example very obvious seeing the germans in tenerife) have not yet adapted to the expectations dictated by the club, or retain a lot of the expecation from the culture they came from, when they speak, it's very clear that they're still quite a distance from having embraced the culture. other foreigners, however, have completely integrated into the culture[^2]. to really become fluent in the language, I postulate requires that one must, to some degree, emotionally connect with the culture.

I hypothesise in this science that *all* cultures and other large groups of thought, such as sciences, mathematics, and technology (including programming) are all consciousness entities. a sensitive programmer can feel how a language evolves as new programmers begin to adopt it. it begins to take on a life of its own, and has a whole "feeling" associated with it, determined by both the semantics of the language (saftety focused, etc.) and by its users (hobbiests, nerds, systems programmers, IT tech support, mathematicians, or web developer bros, for a fer examples).

#### difference in perception between the micro and the macro organsim

I believe the easiest example I can use here will be one of the difference between the human and its cells or the general and the army. as a soldier down on the battlefield, you're in the nitty-gritty of the battle, or the hardship of being without supplies or whatever -- however, to the general, all of these microorganisms are just little bits accomplishing a larger goal; the nitty gritty details of the individual microorganisms are not perceived by the general.

likewise, in your body, there are millions of cells in battle, trauma, dying or whatever at almost any given moment in time, however as the human, you will only feel sick or healthy (and some gradient inbetween). just like the general of the army directing the macroorganism, the human, in the same way does not perceive each of the individual battles and conflicts that its cells are engaged in.

#### the primary function of the consciousness unit (macroorganism) is to ensure its own survival

you will notice that in all of these examples, from culture to programming languages, codified in in its consciousness unit is an automatic emotional response of a bad feeling toward any concept which would seem to threaten its survival. in computer programming languages, it would be some arbitrary set of rules of what is the "correct" way to use the language, or for a significant-other relationship this concept may be perceived interest in someone else, or some culturally dictated idea of romance, or maybe a parental (or disney) instilled expectaion of what such a relationship should "look like" to be a successful one.

therefore, wheneever one within the consciousness unit notices another doing something that is perceived to risk the survival of the unit, a bad feeling (guilt, shame, etc.) is transmitted, to try and mitigate any threats to its survival.

#### consciousness units go all the way up to the universe itself

I believe that around this time, we as a human race are beginning to tap into the "human" consciousness unit. much like the human does not perceive all of the disaster and trauma inflicted to the individual cells by a small flesh wound in the hand, and continues on doing whatever it was it was doing previously, occupied by something much bigger, I postulate that there is a human consciousness unit and also a planetary consciousness unit.

this makes perfect sense, because it never feels good: it always feels like anger, rage, hatred, when we kill each other -- and think about how many surviving organisms there are on this planet which actively destroy parts of itself. I can't think of any -- however there might be. the organism is usually more concerned with defending itself from invaders that cause harm and integrating invaders which can be of benefit. I don't believe it's a successful survival strategy for the organism to be at war with itself, and that's why I postulate it doesn't feel good; it's simply the macroorganism ensuring its own survival.

we as humans (and the animals) also are a part of the planetary consciousness unit. therefore then, it makes perfect sense to me that it feels bad, and causes emotional distress when we pollute and manipulate the environment and the resources provided by the planet. it is my hope that one day we we will have a more consciously simbiotic relationship with the planet. I believe that before we begin to hook into the consciousness unit of the planet, connection into the human consciousness unit will come first (I postulate this for reasons I think would take some time to explain... it has to do with the inward/outward perception cycles).

as we develop our tecnology and begin to be able to move aruond in the solar system, I'm sure that we'll begin to gain a greater connection with the solar consciousness unit as well.

that is all for now. I will continue more and will probably begin to turn this into a proper document, but I wanted to start somewhere :)

[1]: I need to explain better how "knowing" is an emotion: similar to belief -- which is most evident in a heated argument: emotions fly because each person perceives what they "know" -- which is really more of well practised thought than an actual knowing -- instead, you will notice that when you have that intuitive "knowing" -- you'll say, "I just *knew* it was going to happen" -- you felt it strongly. the feeling of knowing was your indicator

[2]: pierre comes to mind as an example here. he's clearly french. he has a slight french accent when speaking spanish even, but to me he's indistinguishable from a spainard in a whole lot of ways.


### 2020-06-04 17:18 - science of consciousness (feedback)

#### where is all of this going? and what about our "inner beings"?

well, if you follow the progression of the expansion of consciousness outbard, you kinda start reaching limits. how would you make human consciousness any bigger than a macro perspective of all human beings? makng a planetary consciousness bigger appears easy: you just go bigger into solar or glactic, right?

to expand the consciousness from human, you must now begin to lose the shape of the human form. we are approaching "source energy" now at this point, because first you would lose temporal separation between all humans (that is, all humans that were, are, and will to be). after that, your "consciousness" needent take the shape of a human and could be "anything"

there seems to be a continuing (and cyclical) expansion of consciousness in the spatial and the temporal components... say, you're an individual human consciousness now. you can go in two directions from there. you can go in the direction of the macro human consmiousness (that is to expand temporally), or the direction of the next biggest thing: planetary consciousness (that is, to expand spatially)

right now, it appears like planetary consciousness *is* human consciousness, but that isn't necessarily the case as, it won't be required for humans to always inhabit this planet.

you can think of macro human consciousness as a "source energy" perspective, because it involves your "inner being" and all of the other "inner beings" of all other humans that have and will live. just the same as all other consciousness units, you comminicate and receive direction and inspiration with this consciousnss unit through your emotions.

if you were to gain planetary conscionusness, again the expansion of consciousness could go in the spaial or temporal direction, gaining solar focus or gaining a more "source-like" perspective of planets. obviously, we cannot comprehend this because we cannot even really comprehend what the macroorganism of a planet "thinks" about on a day-to-day basis (just like a soldier cannot comprehend the general's thoughts) -- so I'm not even going to try.. :)

#### how do we tune to these different consciousness units?

just like an empath, or someone remote viewing, you give your attention to the larger consciousness unit by giving your attention to it (like say a child observing their parents). you get to choose what you give your attention to, and therefore what were you receive your inspiration and emotional feedback from.

#### do we get to choose our temporal or spatial expansion?

of course! I imagine thaat some people (like me) are more interested in a more temporal "source-like" perspective, and others are more intested in being the biggest thing in control of all of the smaller parts (a more spatial expansion). I think both types of expansion are on their way in the coming years. you can already begin to think of nosebook as the beginnings of a macro consciousness of the planet. it may well go bigger.

what's puzzling to me, is why I said I wanted to have galacic consciousness, when clearly you can see that I am much more of a temporally conscious being than a spatially conscious one. misterios.. I guess we'll just have to see


### 2020-06-05 21:13 - I'm all over the place

I slept most of last night, but got up to watch jupiter. it took me a bit but I got there pretty quickly. the sun came up and instead of going out to the field, I just went to sleep. I woke up feeling pretty terrible -- which was a pretty big contrast to how I felt when I was with jupiter. I woke up with pretty terrible depression, because I felt as if there simply wasn't anything that could be done; I would just keep getting the rug pulled out from under me -- because it seemed like every time that I felt like things were beginning to happen, they would kind of reverse on me.

I went with it (the depression) and decided that I'm just going to keep going the way I know how to go, because it doesn't matter if it happens or not, it's still essentially the same path.

I think at some time later, I felt a bit better -- but for no reason at all. I was still beating the depression drum and I really didn't care anymore because more and more I was beginning to see the bigger picture that there's no possible way that we could get close to having a working paradigm that's amazing anytime soon -- certainly not in this lifetime anyway, so it doesn't matter -- and to just learn to have fun along the way.

that's kinda the whole point of what I was seeing, is that probably the whole nosebook thing is never going to get better, and I find it likely that they'll get the ability to move aronud in the solar system and clean up all of the stuff they don't want us to know about before letting us see the solar system. there's probably so much stuff they'll think they need to keep hidden that it'll only further their resolve to ensure we remain in a powerless state.

in the same way that they'll be the first to go out into the solar system, I feel like there is a similarity there to my visual capacity because it seems like, and I don't really know how this works, but in my dream state it seems like I can see people I've never met before. how is that possible, right? like the solar system, this is definitely something I want to explore, but again, for whatever reason, they're there first, and making sure that the ones with actual curiosity to discover, cannot get there.

I just don't care anymore. I don't know what is the right way. is it certain that they always get the good stuff first and hold it away from the ones with interest in it? it seems that's the case, or that they always get first dibs or something ... I don't care about not being first so much, it's just that if I don't get to actually do anything (they take it away or whatever) with the stuff I discover, why discover it?

in that same sort of vibe, remember in the "what I want and why I want it" bit that I wrote? in there, I talked about how the most exciting thing for me was to be able to get into these girls' heads and figure them out, because I'm certain there is a whole lot to be discovered there.

well, following the trend I outlined above, it seems likely that I won't actually get to use any of that stuff that I discover from them, and instead nosebook will take it and use it for their own benefit.

### 2020-06-05 22:42 - vunerability

(this is kind of a coninuation of the previous entry)

as I'm listening to the "rampage" abraham ih giving right now on vulnerability, I was reminded of this. it feels like there is this feeling that if nosebook "figures the girls out" (by repurposing my revelations), then I feel a feeling of vulnerability in response to that idea...

my original post was not focused on feeling of vunerability -- because that's sort of a given. if nosebook wasn't convinced that they couldn't exploit me and the girls further, there's no way they could allow it to happen. that's the whole basis upon their recent efforts to push against it or decrease its size: they do not feel like they are benefiting (by exploiting us), more than poentially we[^1] could gain from the experience.

so, I don't have any doubt that they have full intention already of trying to exploit girls as much as they can from this experience. that seems obvious to me. what I was concerned with, was not that they would use it, because they clearly will, but that I wouldn't actually be able to use the things I did discover. that's the part that frustrates me.

---

regarding vulnerablity though, I had to get over this one pretty quickly. the more rapidly they figure out how my brain works, the more capable they are of trying to manipulate me -- yet I don't really feel like I'm all that manipulated by them. they try really hard to force a whole bunch of stuff through, but every time I get better and better at being more sensitive to what I really want, and what my inner being is broadcasting on the same subject.

in their efforts to gain power over me, I have, in a lot of ways, transformed very considerably. sure they can figure out my thoughts pretty well now, but none of the important stuff happens in my thoughts anymore. sure they can know so much about my eyes as I star watch, but they're completely clueless to how I'm able to release resistance so easily. they may have learned a tremendous amount in effort to exploit me, but I've transformed and gained strength and emotional control far more powerful than they have accomplished with their puny machines.

to perceive, "once they figure the girls out, they'll be able to exploit them" -- really is a pretty victim attitude which I don't endorse. it's probably the beginning of a transformation for females, so likely a really good thing. I really don't think it's a huge problem, and their inner beings most assuredly don't, either.

[1]: mostly I feel a srong sense that they do not want women to gain more power, but I include all people on the planet here, because this morning when I suggested the idea that we could just do all of the stuff but without sex, they didn't like that. they want me to *only* have sex, and not contribute my ideas, because they don't want people to actually know how consciousness works or any of my other ideas. they want to ensure people remain in the dark, and to keep them distracted with stuff like sex.


### 2020-06-07 07:28 - exploitation

I used the word, "exploit" because it was the closest word to mean what I say perhaps "take advantage of" or even something more slave-like, "not get compensated for something that they do". it's really hard for me to convey what I mean with that word, because it's got all sorts of difficulty in it. they don't just rip off my discoveries, but they also hold me away from getting them as well. they do it because they want to have an advantage, but it's frustrating to me because I'm not discovering stuff to try and hold it over them.

for example, I *still* want to use my computer with my mind. I find it very cumbersome to use the keyboard, and I want to do large tasks at the speed of thought. this is a huge issue for me because I have wanted to do this for as long as I can remember. I have always fumbled around with the coordination to press buttons in the right order, but I know that if I could begin building simple building blocks of thought to perform actions on my computer, I could get going pretty fast, just like when imagining something in code, I don't perform the exact action -- I just think things like rename variable or move this to a function or put in an if-statement -- you know whatever.

if I could edit code at the speed of which I think of these things, and teach the computer to do more higher-level things, then that would greatly reduce the time necessary to create a bunch of stuff. clearly, if this were able to be performed inside of my eyes at the speed of thought, you could really imagine how much fun programming would be. obviously they don't want me to be able to do that. they just want to take my visual capacity and use it for their super cool kids gang, and I have to use a keyboard and a mouse like a retard.

---

I wrote that part so you can perhaps see how much frustration I still have built up on the subject. I'm still in the process of learning how to release resistance to those things. I know that my inner being doesn't feel that resistance, and my inner being is neither concerned that they are "exploiting" me, either.

when I said that the whole goal of nosebook is to exploit the girls just like me, I didn't intend to say that it was ok, fair, good, or desirable. what I meant is that I attempt to properly analyse the situation and come to an accurate analysis of it. I don't recommend practicing self-deception. I don't want people to look out and try to paint "a happyface sticker" on a clerly undesirable situation.

instead, I meant that one must be able to accurately identify where they are on the map to be able to figure out where it is they want to go -- and then the only way to be able to make any movement in the direction of what's wanted, you must find a way to feel better about the presently crappy situation. it's the only way to be able to move in a more desirable direction, because otherwise you will just keep spinning around in circles of injustice and unfairness, and it will never get better.


### 2020-06-06 12:06 - little more on exploitation

one of the reactions to what I said was that sometimes it hurts a lot to accuraately locate where you are on the map -- and they're absolutely right: somettimes it does hurt a lot to accuately figure out where you are -- but, that's when you have to be general about it and say stuff like, "any way north of here is an improvement" or "it feels like this is a step in the right direction".

when it comes to the using the computer with my mind, I have to to think that making my own solution is such a big undertaking, it feels too big, and just hoping that they're going to create some special interface for us to use doesn't feel good either. I don't really know exactly where I want to go in that specific desire, so I just leave it really general because there are no solutions in sight, so it would be silly to try and figure it out now.

for precisely this, and many other reasons I have often had the idea floating around in my head that I want to fund it. the main reason for it, is because it takes the whole idea of exploitation or being exploiter and flips it emotionally.

the idea that they're going to provide for us some sort of "playpen" or box of sorts, where they feel like we are best contained and easiest to control, honestly feels a little bit more like a jail than a place that we created and where we're following our dreams.

I was thinking this morning maybe the idea that I should fund it perhaps has a bit of resistance in it as well, and perhaps maybe a sort of collaborative funding would be in order. we would obviously do everything out in the open -- probably as github repos or something, and people could have quite an ability to collaborate along with us and to participate with viewership. I really don't know how it could happen, so again I'm just leaving it for now.

---

the most important thing I want to convey is that expecting the "offender" of your injustice to right it in some way with some sort of compesation, will only give you something that imprisons you more. instaed, flip it on its head and begin to live the way you want things without expecting the offender of the injustice to right their wrong in some way.

the reason why I say that is, not to let them "off the hook" so to speak, but for you. if emotion is the precursor to manifest reality (wether in the imagination or in physical form), and I assure you, it is -- then you want to be finding a way to chnge the perception in your mind to a way that feels better to you -- downplaying as much as possible the problem in your mind. if you do this, you will feel better, and instead of feeling injustice or unfairness, which just creates more injustice or unfairness, now you can begin to have a path forward toward what's wanted.

expecting compensation from the offender will only exacerbate the problem, as usually they have no intention of changing, anyway, and their compensation will only take more of the feeling of freedom that you want to feel away.


### 2020-06-07 10:28 - spatial and temporal fear

I had a dream last night where a guy was saying something -- kinda maybe asking me my thoughts on it. it sounded like they were trying to remove the fear response in a person. he went on to say something like, "you would think that the more you know, the less you would be scared of, yet we constantly find certain weird indescribable things that seem to cause peole fear"

I thought that idea was kinda funny, but I really like it. before jumping into the difference between temporal and spatial fear (or confidence), I want to recognise the similarity of these srange unbased fears that you perceive even when your brain "knows" differently. it's a whole lot like my eyesight: even though I "know" that there are bricks that go up to about halfway on the triange parts of the blue apartments by the field, I still see them as blue. I may know here are windows on the tan houses behind those, yet I do not see them.

it seems the visuals that I see in my eyes are not generated from a conscious part of my brain (which is probably good, because then I would need to be conscious for you guys to be able to use my visual capacity). it seems that some of the most important "functioning" of the brain seems to happen even when you're not conscious -- and that your consciousness is only there to kind of "guide" or direct all these unconsious processes.

---

now, why would my brain decide that the houses are going to be blue, even when I know that they do indeed have bricks? it seems that this occurs because the information that the brain does have (I don't know what I really see, but I'm assuming it's probably something blue on the horizon), so given the information that it has (colour and shape), it makes the resaonable assumption based on that to create the image.

in the case of a fear-based response, I would assume that the same thing is happening.. and given the information the brain is given, say it's spiky legs on an insect, because anything spiky coming at you means danger, you will feel a moment of fear as your brain puts simple concepts together rapidly to keep you alive. likely the way to change that would be to actually alter the DNA of the organism to no longer have that response.

---

this brings me perfectly to my definition of temporal confidence (or fear). imagine all of the monkeys in the past who have went to swing from a branch and missed. a long time ago high up in the jungle canopy, those surely fell to their death. evolution has produced over time monkeyes that have the confidence to swing through the trees like that and have confidence that anoher thing capable of being grabbed will be there.

there is a part of us that is more confident than ever, and you see it in the kids. they are more sure they can do stuff than most adults are. most adults teach them to be cautious and to not have this confidence anymore, so they begin to lose it. or, let's say they're someone looking at statistics and noticing that X% have this undesirable thing happen to them, like death. let's take driving a car for example -- that's plenty dangerous, yet people do it all the time.

you can run statistics and see that there are a certain number of mortality rates driving a car and under certain infuences (drugs alcohol, etc), but yuo can also see the reverse statistic is true of people driving just fine under those same substances. while the substance does increase the risk, it is certainly not the cause of car accident fatality. until statistics gain better understanding of "why", there will always seem to be these strange occurances which seem to defy our understanding of how these things happen.

for example, I don't think that car statistics take into account the way the person feels, or how much fear the person has had of accidents (or other risky things in general). has the person been feeling like their life (or something that is really important to them) is being taken away from them? maybe the person was sevelrely depressed and that was their easiest way to reemerge into non-physical without going through some terrible illness which would eventually take their life...

thing is, if statistics were to look at those things too, it would probably be found that most deaths are pretty unique and not able to easily be categorised as action = result, eg. drinking = car accident (for example) -- which if emotion, and the past summary of what sort of things their thoughts (and what they've been giving their attention to) have been making them feel -- were all to be accounted for basically makes statistics almost useless in the sense that one can no longer label certain action as good or bad. instead one must give the "bad" label to the feeling or the thought pattern which attracted the result.

---

next up, I want to talk about what I meant by temporal expansion of consciousness. I don't have a good word for it; I want to use "species" but that's too big, so I'll use the word "genus" -- but what I mean by it is actually much more general and specific than that. each person is their own genus, yet they also relate to others on many different factors imposed by the DNA and also imposed by the environment. these factors are like overarching consciousness units, and let's say brown hair is one of them (which is a member of human hair), and the consciousnses unit is direcly involved with the improvement of this hair type, finding different compatible hair products and methods to create the nicest hair. people with this hair type will get inspiration to do things with their hair that they hadn't already thought of. (perhaps a good way to see this could be thought of as similar to sheldrake's morphic resonance).

within the species of humans, there are zillions of different overlapping consciousness units, and each of them is constantly improving. however, along the way there have been a number of failures that have occurred. these bugs get worked out of the code until it becomes less and less likely to occur, and for the one making the failure, you must know that the consciousness units involved in the improvement of the those genuses, have already come up with improvements, which the one making the failure can (if they want), be the first to find the improvement, but don't worry because future generations will benefit from the improvement automatically.

the confidence in the ever improving genuses of you that you exist (I'm speaking physically here, but one can imagine that this is also pretty similar to how "source energy" works) is something that you you seem to be born with, yet gradually lose with time as you focus on things that don't see things as always improving.

I have often wondered why someone might not have desire to improve yourself. I postulate that it is because improvement feels like change and that feels risky, so doing things that involve different things (even if the brain "knows" they're an improvement, perhaps similar to missing thumb, the brain universally categorises it as something to be afraid of). personally, I have found that it's *more* risky for me not to continually improve. in so many situations of my life, I don't have the ability to desire stability -- and if I had've, I would be in a much worse spot than I am right now.

---

following the pattern of the expansion of consiousness, one might be able to expand vertically or horizontally. I labeled them previously as spatially and temporally, but I think here, I'll call them vertically and horizontally in reference to sever scaling: you can increase the size of the specs of the machines (vertically), or you can increase the number of machines running in parallel (horizontally).

it's a funny thing, because I postulate that one cannot expand the size of their consciousness vertically if they have fear -- in fact, letting go of the fear is exacly what is required to expand someone's consciousness so that they "see more", most resistance is fear and it's all completely unbased. the wider your consciousness expands out to, the more you see yourself (instaed of seeing only through your eyes) from the same vantage point of source, and so the less and less there is to fear.

the irony of that is, you could imagine how compelling it would be to increase in size of consciousness for someone who has a lot of fear. a human is at a whole lot more risk of death than say a planet is. lots of things happen on the surface of a planet, but it really would take quite a force to get rid of a planet. we have the evidence of the kuiper belt to tell us that at one time a different planet existed in the 5th position there, so we know that planets can be destroyed.

science says otherwise, but I don't believe that suns run out of gas or explode. when they nova, they come right back and get stronger. also, they're a gas, so they can't run out of it :) suns seem to last pretty much forever out there -- but I suppose it would be possible for a sun to "die" in some way (I kinda doubt the galactic "merger" concepts a bit, but anyway). finally galaxies seem to be the most robust of them all. let's say in a tragic collision of two galaxies where each one loses tons of its stars, the galaaxy core itself still remains. you could say that a galaxy is most "immortal" of all life that we see.

---

so, that got me thinking: what if there was exactly the situation that's happening now, where someone (me) is providing a way for these guys to, instead of beginning to have temporal confidence in the improvement of their species, they are given a chance to expand the size of their consciousness. I've been saying -- and even wondered why in a previous entry why I want to expand spatially, when I'm much more of a temporal person -- that I want to expand into galaxy size consciousness. that always seemed funny to me...

now *what if* the whole reason was not go get me to galactic level of consciousness, but to get the nosebook guys up there? following the discussion here an interesting thing is happening because like I said, galaxies are pretty much uncontested. there is nothing that really threatens their existance. so, what if you somehow gave these guys the ability to expand their consciousness spatially so big that they could control a galaxy (kinda like how they're already a bit the macro consciousness of the planet, and potentially very soon the solar system), *what if* they were able to be able to become the macro consciousness of the galaxy?

who knows, really what that would be like and maybe they'll find that kind of size something that feels good, and cosmic timescales to be something that feels stable... dunno. anyway, I did have an interesting idea because what if being the the biggest (essentially immortal) thing in the known universe *still* wouldn't allow them to quell their fear and they continued to believe in their imminent destruction?

well, LOA doesn't lie, so it *must* attract something that were able to challenge their survival in some way and once again make them feel insignificant again, and so they would have, in that process, created something even bigger and more magnificent than what we know as a galaxy. it would, following the size patterns, be something closeer to the size of the universe, but inside of this universe, creating enormous expansion. these big things are hard for me to think about, but these guys are such such strong and dilligunt thinkers; their focus so incredible, *why not* give them the opporunity to create something that big??


### 2020-06-10 16:10 - spectral sight

> "those without eyes truly see"

I woke up this afternoon from a dream where I became conscious because in the dream, there was someone in a red(?) (I think it was a racing) uniform that said something like, "hey kenny check this out" and then they toom off their hat or something. I imagine it was something like the end of the "supermode - tell me why" music video, but I became conscious because I didn't really know what to respond. I said, "you know I can't see, right?" then, after waiting for the reaction, I explained how far I've progressed since the original dream with raquel where it was pure black and she said she wanted me to contact her -- so I did.

I wrote her an email, and then by the reaction from her email, it turns out that it was a sexy dream -- yet, there was nothing sexy about it for me. I just saw blackness. this really puzzled me for quite a while, however as time has continued on, I have begun to get more and more of a sense of what is happening in dreams, so much so that I awake from a dream where it felt like I was communicating with john michael's ex, and I it seemed like she had a striped orangish shirt, and when I went to (presumably) hug her, I becmame conscious when I touched her, because I felt a hole in her shirt and I didn't know what to do.

nowadays, I have a pretty good grasp of what's happening in the dreams, and I've begun to notice that I have this capacity in the wake state as well. last night, for exacple, I seemed to be able to navigate around a big pool of water without much of a problem. this morning I returned to the spot and I looked at the ledge I climbed up to get out, and I was terrified because I could see the big pool of water just below. I decided not to go in the daylight, because I could "see" myself falling into it (and my shoes were a bit muddier).

also, last night I fell kinda into a ditch, but not nearly as bad as when I was first thinking about that [TODO: find the entry], and as I was walking while talking about how I'm able to see when I'm blind, I faceplanted into a ditch cause I wasn't watching where I was going. anyway, last night, right before I almost fell into the ditch I did notice a bit of a sense that I should proceede with caution, and I didn't full crash and burn. it seems that, if I were more sensitive to those sensations, then there's a good chance I could completely operate without a problem without eyesight.

I also noticed that there's another peculiar thing that happens when I have been dreaming -- it seems that they have been trying to condition me to be afraid of heights so that I don't fly in my dreams. sometimes I fly anyway though, and they spend enormous effort to keep me grounded where they can control me. however, if I can't see, I can't be afraid of hights.

---

so I was outside eating lunch thinking about this dream thing where I can't see, and it dawned on me, that I have no idea how they're going to be able to continue on holiding my eyesight the way they are now. imagine a normal person has a 1000px screen in each eye. my vision has expanded quite a bit, but I definitely don't see with the clarity that I should, so imagine my vision is like a 10Kpx or 100Kpx screen in each eye. also I estimate that my aura is about the size of colorado by now, and that's at let's say 10Kpx... well, if I'm going to galaxy sizes, I simply don't have enough data of my progresson, but I can imagine that it's going to be a an awful lot of pixels on that screen. I have no idea my progression or the rate at which I'm increasing (even though I know it's accelerating)

so, I was thinking that their machines simply will not be able to at some point, be able to put anything visually meaningful into my eyes if they want to maintain this whole charade. I suspect that I'll just keep going more and more "blind" as things progress. I don't really think it bothers me really. I was noticing with the previous neighbour, and noticing how things at a distance seem to be imagined by my mind, that my mind just sorta makes stuff up given the information that it's given -- and that's probably how she seemed to have appeared to me as so many different ages and stuff, probably because I didn't actually see her and my mind just made up the details -- so it really only shows more about how I imagined her to be, rather than how she really is.

so, I gave the idea a go where I would essentially go blind over the next few years. it doesn't really bother me that much. it kinda creates an interesting thing because if the girls don't have me to see them as beautiful, then they're going to have to figure out how to see theirselves that way. there are so many numerous advantages to me going blind, because they (nosebook) will have a really hard time to really control me, because I'll live almost entirely in my non-visual imagination. I kinda like it.

I wonder what happens when my aura gets to be bigger than the planet... will that mean that everyone will be able to begin seeing what I imagine because I no longer see it? the girls could be anything they wanted to be, and only you guys would notice that there's any difference... honestly, pretty cool to think about, because I'll become the dominant visual platform for the planet, yet I'll be blind :)


### 2020-06-13 07:15 - «you don't really believe it»

when I first herd abraham say this to one of my stand-ins, it kept bouncing around in my head, because I thought maybe I believed it a little more than I did. the thing is, they were kinda right though because even though during the day, various events regarding the girls would allow me to feel it a bit more, it's true that when I woke up, I typically did not believe it. essentially, the conditions were creating the belief -- it wasn't my own.

you see, no matter how much nosebook may appear that they are on-board with the girls thing, there are some (a lot) that are not, but they have to, for the ones in nosebook that are and for a lot of the public, pretend like they are. the ones that aren't feel forced because of majority opinion, and PR reasons, forced to go along with it. so, I'm sure they figure that if they're "forced" to go along with it, then they need to feel like they control it.

I felt the same thing with marcos, which is the only reason why I'm making such a resolute statement (even though it's pretty logical and easy to see, as well). as a result, they want to be the provider and or the initiator of the manifestation, so that they can control it. if I were to allow it to happen, they would not feel like they're in control, so it's in their best interest that I *don't* believe it -- which is exactly what I notice: I go to sleep and I wake up generally feeling like it's not going to happen.

there's another thing that is also in play here... it's just that I figured, perhaps from fwh's statements and other places, that I would simply just continue on right through without needing a manifestation. I can find so many good reasons actually why I would also be quite fine without having the manifestation -- or delaying it further:

#### futher growth

look at how much I've grown in the last few years. their constant efforts to keep me where they think I should be, have been perfecting me in such a rapid way. I really don't have nearly any of the difficulty I had just a few years ago. I'm really feeling like this is such good progress I'm making, I kinda want to keep it up until they cannot hold anymore. I want to "win" the disagreement that we have that emotion is the precursor to manifestation, and I'm continually getting better at it, so much they they will see soon enoungh that I will feel so much better than their machines are able to hold me back any more.

#### furher expansion and evolution of the desire

the funny thing about LOA is that it's always right on. I can't rememeber how many times I've thoguht to myself, "ok, this is good enough; any further and things are going to fall apart" -- but they don't ever fall apart -- instead, they transform into something even more wanted than before. I've come to learn that the evolution of desire is quite something to be trusted and is always more desirable -- even if with human eyes, it looks like things may be falling apart.

> If I sit in my own place of patience, what I need flows to me and without pain. From this, I understand, that what I want, also wants me, is looking for me and attracting me. -Rumi

I love that part where it says that what I want is attracting me. the way I see it, let's just keep going until what I want is attracting me so strongly that there's nothing more that they can do do try and prevent it any more.

in addition, another thing that abraham said one time was something like, "you'll want to be having such a good time on the way to your manifestation, then you'll not want to make the change, but you can't avoid it. it's inevitable" -- or something like that. I probably have the quote off there, but the inevitable part there also speaks to the desire attracting me. LOA is for reals. so, it's inevitable huh? let's try it :)

#### take it to the limit

> "... past the point of no return; you gatta *feel it* -- *FEEL IT!*"

(the image this gives me reminds me of maverick -- thanks daniel!)

why not push it out until the very limit? I'm learning and gaining rapidly more emotional control than I ever have been. I assure you, I've totally got this. they ones sweating and unable to sleep at night are the ones trying to make things happen. so why not trust LOA and *allow* it to happen?

---

so what does that look like in practical terms? well, I'm coming up with them more rapidly than I thought I would, but for example last night I was thinking, "yeah I do really want to be around a whole bunch of girls and interact with them sexually" I suppose that's a good start. the next thing I was noticing is that I can begin to transform my perception to one that is beginning to anticipate it. that will help too, and I know that I'll be getting there when I wake up in the morning and I don't feel like "it's not going to happen" -- because the way their machines work is that the signals they put into your head only have an effect if you're resonant to them. that only means I'm still resonant to not believing it's going to happen.

I'm going to start with those for now. neither of them are in opposition to my desire to find my connection. in fact, I think they're in harmony because they're the same road -- because, at some point I have to actually begin to believe that I'm going to get connected instead of relying on the conditions (sex) to get connected.

what I'm saying is, in both situations, belief that the girls thing was going to happen and also my own connection, I had been relying on conditions to bridge the gap instead of trusting the LOA.

so, let's just keep this going. I thing it's going to really start to go fast now. as I become less and less resonant to the signals that they're putting in my head to keep me in disbelief, the more rapidly things will accelerate until their efforts are no longer effective, and I will have "won" or "proved" that there is no strength stronger than the power of desire. or, better said, no strength stronger than one's who's in pure alignment with a desire.


### 2020-06-15 06:54 - a new thought experiment

yeserday, when I was taking a shower, I had some interesting reactions because at some point yesterday I was monologuing about my experience with raquel. I made a point that one of the things I learned early on from mom (even though I believe the teaching originally came from nancy), that when I get offended, now I'm in the wrong -- and so, just don't get offended by anything. I then made a point about how in spain, that idea is pretty much unheard of, because there seems to be a protest about something in multiple places in the country per week. they call the protests, "manifestations" -- which is kind of funny to me because they equate a "manifestation" with visibly showing the world how offended they are. anyway...

so, now here's the thought experiment: imagine for a moment that there was a "reincarnation" of tesla that was born in 2001, and works for nosebook... then, imagine that he teamed up with raquel to make a new timeline with raquel going through in my body -- well, she would have to figure out some how how to no longer get offended about stuff. the idea is, she would be more frequencially similar to me, and at some time when we were having sex, perhaps her consciousness could enter my body because we're so frequentially similar in that moment, that then she could continue on just as I did, experience the breakup, the following recovery only to find herself later with marcos, then in the centre of the nosebook experience like I was.

well, in order for her to experience the timeline in a similar way, she would have to accumulate some base understanding of things like I had. I gained a lot of the core concepts from learning to work with my left-side, mom, nancy, and abraham's teachings that I listened to while drinking whiskey (lol). later, at augusto's house, I finally started to get it with the mdma and the mushrooms, when in those hightened drug experiences, I was able to receive the images (symbols of thing to come) I drew on paper, which then turned into what it is now.

once she gets those, then she's off and running, and then she can, like I did, learn what freedom really is, and actually desire to feel good more than anything else. nosebook really does all the rest because of the way they're set up (needing to keep their secrets, and please the audience as much as possible).

whe would tesla want to do this? well, I imagine that he's a person really concerned with optimisation, and he has this idea of building a sort of high energy utopia here on earth, but he needs people to be energetically capable of living in such a space -- people like me who "need" an environment like the one that nosebook wants so hard to keep away from me. they're essentially designed to ensure I (and anyone else) do not get connected. so, the goal for him in his "utopia" is to get people that are all connected there. in his "last interview", he talked about creating the impossible: an earth full of people like jesus or buddha. we know that contrast is necessary, so the "utopia" isn't the traditional idea of utopia, where everything is perfect, but utopia in the sense of having tremendous "light density" (his words).

so, in order to create such a place he would need a whole bunch of people that are at the power level of being able to find their way to connection even in the difficulty of the nosebook experience. the "reward" at the end is the girls, I would assume, and this is where I made the connection. if anyone desires to have a similar experince to me, then, imagine (if this thought experiment were real -- that's the point of the thought experiment: to mentally explore a new reality) that you could find yourself dreaming of having such an experience, and then actually make the transition into my body.

I think the connecting thing is the sex bit, so perhaps after participating in enough of the experiences that I'll sure to be having soon, you gain more and more vibrational similarity to me to be able to find yourself all of a sudden in a past version of body, heading toward what would eventually be the nosebook experience. for us here, it would just look like you "died" while participating.

back to the experiment: if he designed a set of mental programs that would run in the person's head to kind of implant the experience necessary to get the person through, then, after getting raquel through in my body, he could be more confident to get others through, too.

each of these people going through would arrive to an energy level which would be able to exist quite well on such an energy dense planet, and let's say that at the end of the timeline -- in 2038, all of these "kenny"s are terminated and put into new bodies on his new 5d super energetic earth he's building.

---

thinking about this thought experiment, it could work and it doesn't violate any LOA. if someone has desire to experience a kenny-like experience for theirselves, then it's not asserting anything into their experience -- actually, making their desire become a reality. also, it doesn't violate LOA's necessaity to have contrast because there will eb plenty of it: if he's able to create models of each different person and create corresponding mental programs (like how to not be offended), which allow the person to make it through the timeline, then that means that in their new body, they'll be more likely, but not certain to be able to get to that knowledge again. additionally, since I would guess that the mental capacity to make it through is mostly tempoary -- probably from programmed in dream expereinces which make a person more likely to respond in a way.

which basically means that "knowledge" didn't really come from real actual experience, and so in their new bodies, the person will (just like with real experience too), still have opportunities to "shore" up that knowledge furthrer.


### 2020-06-15 07:50 - I don't know what to think really, so I'm puttin it out here

last night, I had a few weird experiences that I don't really know what to think. I can't remember the order, but I notably had the thought come into my head from my friend "turbo knight" (dunno his name) where I wanted to comment on a video where he had a drone flying to one of his songs. in the comment, he said something about the kids in his city, and I felt something there. I decided to leave it, because if it would grow, then it would become notable. well, when I was in the shower, around the same time as the thought experiment it popped into my head. it felt to me like there are some finnish girls in his city that are interested in joining. I think it's a great idea. it happened a few more times too, so it feels pretty strong so I'm definitely on board with that.

then, there was another totally random one that popped into my head -- I remembered the dryer repairman that was at our house, which is really weird, because I surely would have forgot[^1] and I had this sensation that one of his daughters was also interested in joining. she's welcome to join too, if that's a thing.

lastly, and I don't remember when it was, and it wasn't the first time it happened, but the name "bpasero" popped into my head, and no big deal I had been reading vscode issues earlier that day, but yesterday I hadn't been, and the thought felt more present than the normal ones (the ones with more reaction seem to feel stronger, but this one I'm sure wasn't coming from a reaction, so I didn't know why its strength). anyway, I may be way off here, but it was worth noting cause it happened so many times with enough strength -- even though I didn't feel nearly any attraction like I did with the other two, so if it's not a thing, don't worry at all, but if it is, she's welcome to join too, if she wants.

[1]: no really, my memory is so bad lately, I can't even remember large sections of last night, or even really what happened yesterday, so it seems that the only "memory" of things I have in the past, are things that are somehow relevant, because otherwise I can't access it. it's really weird (and I think it's more to be living "more in the now") because I have virtually no capabiliy anymore of accessing things in the past unless they're somehow relevant -- though sometimes even those things take a bit to get out of the filecabnet.


### 2020-06-15 15:36 - to smoke or not to smoke, that is the question

first, let me make it extremely clear that I have no intention of smoking when I'm with the girls -- at all. furthermore, I find it to be pretty unlikely that I'll be doing a whole lot of programming anyway, unless I have the ability to use the computer with my mind. I really like the project I'm working on, but I feel like I'm bootstrapping it more than anything. I have been thinking about it for maybe close to 6-7 years now (I first came up with the poem idea, I think, when I was at zaryn's house in plaza de las cortes) after we sold tuenti. it was what I determined I would invest my time and effort into since the tuenti ship had sailed.

I didn't ever really begin making any headway on any real visual/tangible part of the project, until I was with raquel, but she had this like 6th sense and knew when I was programming, so she would come and I think she was honesly jealous or felt some sort of competition for my attention, so she'd work up something to fuss about. I finally gave up with her, and by the time she left, I was far too heavy of a drinker to be doing anything serious. I revisited the project again with augusto, marcos, and finally jori, none of those time I was ever really lucid enough to really get anything done.

previous to that and before we sold tuenti, the project existed in the form of a d-lang project, which because it was so long ago, it used iframes to fill in the panel content. I expanded on the idea at augusto's for affinaty, but I just kept thinking about how it would expand the idea and never got anything real done. I had the typical syndrome of working endlessly on the framework without actually building something. so, because I have been thinking about the project for so long now that I have quite a big idea of what I want it to be, but the road to get there is probably endless if I just keep working on the idea (ideas, I told augusto on a few occasions, I've found are infinite and for free, but the real winner of the idea is the one who can bring it to earth and implement it).

so, it starts with getting something built. that's why I started writing affinaties for the second time now (which is kinda my third rehash of essembly). I have kept myself from getting too far down into framework land, but honestly, it's the only thing I can honestly see, when I'm so demotivated[^1] because often times the thing that excites me and makes me feel so good and want to create, is exactly the reason why nosebook is forcing me to go to sleep: because when I feel good I get vision upgrades, so if I like (and feel good) about what I'm programming, for them, that's bad.

as a result, I've done a whole lot more framework development than I've wanted to, trying to build this affinaties project...

so, I decided I would quit smoking again, and I just had finished the build system state, when I went off on to a huge tangent about how I will be eventually going toward creating the symbolic language interaction to this program. this happens all the time and is basically what I spent most of my time doing at augusto's house. I want to be more like marcos' house style now where I spend my time building then going out to nature, then building and nature.

like marcos always said to me, "we need to just get *something* built" -- and that's kinda how I feel about it now. I just want to get it done. I'm not happy with how much coffee I'm drinking or how much I'm smoking, but it seems to be quite a focus mechanism...

---

speaking of which... I've been trying to figure out what makes me work creatively for some time now. I found that sex (with raquel anyway) made me want to create the thing. I found that drugs (alcohol, weed mdma, but not shrooms) all made me want to work on the idea.

historically, when I was in spain (and in california at ryan's house), I found that smoking demotivated me. I felt better and wanted to work more on the thing when I wasn't smoking cigarettes than when I was. however, I often couldn't see the thing clear enough, so I would smoke weed or something and then I can see it clear, but I'm all idea and no implementation.

I have concluded that if I could actually program my computer with my mind, then I would be able to do drugs and actually work on the thing. it just feels like far too much effort to make something when I see things clearly, so I'd rather see them, than fight with a compiler or something. obviously this isn't possible yet, so I'm forever on my quest to create it.

however, for now it seems like things have shifted since I last did any real programming (which was with marcos), now the cigarettes similar to how I was at his house seem to focus me, but they wear me out faster. I'm much stronger now than before, so I don't even get light-headed, and have the "bajón" anymore, either.

in conclusion, it seems that drugs = feeling better, and feeling better means I see better nnd seeing better means I work on the idea. so smoking cigarettes must make me feel worse, which means I tend to stick to the work, then go out in nature and feel good and sometimes work on the idea... (similar to how I was at marcos' house)

---

so it would see that it's a no-brainer for me to continue to smoke -- and I would agree, but my mind kicks in and says that if I'm supposed to be getting connected, will that actually happen when I'm smoking cigarettes? it feels to me like smoking is evidence of remaining resistance, and that when I'm connceted, I'll be all idea, because I'll be doing all the creating in my mind, so virtually zero implementaiton unless I find a way to connect my mind up to my computer. it's really REALLY something I want to do, and would be really cool if he girls could, too. I dunno maybe in a few years I can come up with a system to do it (I've wanted to make a nosebook-like thing for people, but not probably not global, but probably local)...

anyway, I don't see any reason why once I get conncted, I'll be more in the idea mode, more than in the productive mode. (abraham has made multiple references to this, talking about pointing at the creation, as if you're one that sees the bigger picture) I also can see why I would probably want to be spending the majority of the time with the girls, and getting the gnomitos thing off he ground, too.

so, while I think it's a great idea to quit smoking, it seems to keep me feeling bad enough to be productive (but not emotionally instability making me want to create structure because I can't see the big picture) so I'll probably continue to smoke. I would imagine, even though I said it'll go quick, I really don't see it realistically happening until I stop smoking. I really want to get the project in a presentable enough state to give to the girls, too, cause otherwise I'll be trying to do both and my experience tells me, that's just not possible to do both -- even though it's really what I want to do most of all[^2].

[1]: I have a whole idea on why building of sructure is preferred by programmers more than the actual creation in relation to someone's emotional space, because I would often compare myself to dani, who was almost always concerned with the creation, which was how I was too, until tuenti got sold, and I think my feeling that if I invest my creativity into something that someone can just hijack so easily because it's only the visual frontend replacable client code -- instead I want to work on something lasting: a data structure, or a framework that will continue to exist even after the money-hungry have shat on it. in steve jobs terms, I lost my product focus.

[2]: I have no idea why I want to program so much after sex, but it's this inasatiable thing that I just cannot deny. I suppose I'm going to just have to figure out how to just be ok with not being creative for the duration of the girls experience. so, I figure it's probably why the last drawing in the 3 symbols of the future, I'm showing people machines capable of desire -- because I will have spent so much time away from creativity and productivity, that after the "this is my reality" symbol has been established, and maybe when some of the boys are old enough to help out, too -- then, I'll have so much creative voracity, I will be a whirlwind of creative output.


### 2020-06-17 07:07 - perfecting the past

yesterday in response to the abraham now broadcast @[abe-now](2020-06-11 49:25) I was talking about how the past, depending on how you feel when you perceive it, can be perceived as anything from awful all the way to the perfect culmination of all of the things that brought you to this moment of extacy.

while I was referring to the human race as a whole, because it's easy for me to see how the average person will feel tremendously great in comparison those in the present and even the past. even the last thought experiment @[noseblog](2020-06-15 06:54) was on that this subject as well, because you couldn't have a planet with such light density if it weren't filled with people that knew how to find a way to feel good no matter the circumstances. the world that a tesla would be building would be full of all sorts of experiments so you could imagine how much diversity there would be -- not to mention that it would most certainly be completely mechanised and automated, so no one would have any real control over how the world exists and functions either (kinda like what we're beginning to have here as well, but here will be much more primitive, with the noseboys having all the super-tech -- instead of everybody living in a fully automated constantly perfecting itself machine world).

he would build all sorts of ideas in his head, and he spent the majority of his time thinking about and perfecting his inventions in his head -- and this works really well for mechanical stuff, however, you cannot do this with consciousness, otherwise source wouldn't take so much pleasure in our continued expansion of our desires and coming into alignment with them (because they create new things). so, in his world, with the latest focus of perfecting human consciousness, all of his experiments would have to live in real life to see the results in consciousness (hence the doll-house metaphor I've given)

so, none of the humans on his planet will really have a whole lot of control, being completely subject to his constant experimentation, so the conscious ones would have to be a whole bunch of people like me who are not focused on the circumsatances, instead upon the improvement. in order to make the experiments controllable, the rest of the people would all be "automatons" -- controllled by him to put the conscious ones in predicaments which can be controlled to optimise the results.

---

this morning I had an interesting experience where I was interacting with the motorcycle attendent becase he fired up the chopper when I mentioned that I was amazed how I cannot see he enormous windows on the apartments on the field from way back, when they're so big.

the roar of the motor seemed to imply that I was touching a sensitive subject. I explained to him that even if it is their fault that the screen in my eye is broken, it doesn't matter to me, because virtually every day now, I can see marked improvement in some aspect of my vision. I questioned him in a somewhat frustrated tone,

> "why, when I'm seeing improvements daily, would I go back to focusing on the problem? the whole method for getting the improvments is releasing resistance -- that is being OK with where I'm at, and only noticing the improvements"

that pretty much sums it all up. all one has to do is to carry on the trajectory of my continued improvement to see that, even now, but especially in not such a short time in the future, I will be looking back at my past from a feeling of pure extacy, noticing that the moment of pure extacy I'm experincing now is the culmination of everything "difficult" I had experienced, and all I had to do was to find a way to be OK with it, and to only see the improvements.

---

I talk often about "getting connected" -- but it's quite possible that may not actually happen for quite some time. instead, it may be that I just continue on with all the same problems I have now, yet because I'm so focused on only the improvements, that it'll still be -- even though none of the "problems" have really changed, and I have yet to gain control, and never will, like tesla's world -- a feeling of pure extacy.

I doubt this world is going to become anything more than more diverse and more contrast as time continues on. alhough tesla's mechanical world is a super wonderful thought experiment for me, the reality is we are here, and here seems to be heading on a similar trajectory:

none of us will likely ever gain any sense of control over the conditions in which we live. I would imagine that they (nosebook) will have a continuing sense of urgency to try and get things under their control as more and more people threaten their sense of superiority, so they'll need to take more and more power away from us, to try and regain their feeling of control. the only option we have is find a way to be OK with where we're at, and only perceive the improvement.

I will give a message of hope though, because unlike tesla's world, which is actually sustainable because it's all automated, this world is not. eventually, they'll run out of things they can try to control physically, and it'll eventually collapse and a wonderful creation will be made, so it's not forever. try to have fun along the way though, and if you only see improvements, then your life *will* steadily climb toward pure extacy. you might not be able to imagine how good it feels to continuually see impovement even in the midst of such difficulty. think invincible, unstoppable, pure power that the world is a reflection of you knowing that the well-being abounds and the perceived "difficulty" is only there to furher prove[^1] to you how unstoppable and invincible you are.

[1]: just like how focusing on things going wrong, life proves itself to you that things just continually go wrong and wronger.. that happens when you notice unimprovements instead of improvements :)


### 2020-06-17 17:17 - waking up now...

I wrote the previous entry just before sleeping, and just woke up now.. as usual, I woke up feeling like I'm never going to get connected.

well, like I've mentioned so many times previous, their effort to continue to try and convince me of that is precisely the practice that I need *to get connected*. what I mean is, for whatever reason, I'm still resonant with those ideas, which is why they still affect me.

I sort of brought the thing on to myself a bit knowingly when I included the last section, where I said,

> "it's quite possible that may not actually happen for quite some time. instead, it may be that I just continue on with all the same problems I have now, yet because I'm so focused on only the improvements"

I woke up with the idea that I wouldn't ever get connected, and I would continue on until the "end" of it all when I have my "final" interaction with andrea... that's the gist of it.

first of all, I want to mention that the thought that happened when I woke up didn't at all feel good to me, which basically means that I'm not perceiving it in the same way as my inner being is.

I think that they're reacting to the part where I mentioned that tesla's world would be susainable, and this one is not. when I said that, what I was referring to is that I have come to understand that emotion is the precursor to manifestation or "reality" and the manifestation of the reality that anyone is experiencing is a reflection of how they feel. so, if on tesla's world, even though all of the conditions of that world are controlled, including the who the conscious ones interact with (they would be controlled automaons), then if the conscious ones were able to continually find a way to feel good, the circumstances would continue to be a reflection of how they feel.

so, if tesla were to, in his world, try and hold that well-being away from its inhabitants, then it, like this one, would not be sustainable. however, if the effort is to create a world with incredible light density[^1] then clearly that could not be so. it order for it to have such light density, it must be a world with incredible diversity. I explained that this world would be filled with tons of his living experiments. I mentiond that he must have tried out millions of different ideas/experiments in his mind for his discoveries into the nature of electricity. however, when it comes to the opimisation of human consciousness, that wouldn't really be something one could do so easily in their mind...

so instead, because they're experiments on human consciousness, and consciousness only expands with interaction with other consciousness (think LOA and thoughts expanding), those experiments must exist in some place where they could expand. machines and mechanical creations operate (thankfully) in a predictable way, and so they can operate in the predictable patterns of one's mind.

when one thinks about how computers work and programs are made stronger, they're run against a "fuzzer" -- which is a machine that generates infinite input conditions designed to break the program. when an atttack vector is found, then the bug is fixed and the fuzzer runs on the new code. I imagine his setup would be something pretty similar to that, so by nature, diversity would continue to emerge from the infinte input conditions performed on the conscious ones, producing all sorts of unxepcted results.

in this thought experiment, that process begins with figuring out how to implant mental programs into the people's minds being run through my experience. those mental programs would have to provide a mental condition for the person being run through my experience[^2] to be able to actually make it through.

there are tons of bad ideas like: guilt, shame, justice, unworthiness, self disapproaval, caring too much about what others think, etc. that must be worked around, until one has the ability to find the way to their desire to feel good over any other circumstance.

getting through the circumstances that I'm in is really good, but it's only really one instance of experience, and if I can find it once and make it through, then that's really good. that just means I'm more likely to behave that way in similar circumstances, but by no means am I always going to behave that way.

therefore, creating the mental environment for a person to be able to make it through my experience is only the first step. clearly phase two would be to make a controlled world where these circumstances and environments could be created at will and the conscious one put in these environments, along with the constantly improving program wich will outline the most effective experence to "patch" that attack vector, until enough experiene is gained that none of the attack vectors can compromise the conscious one any more.

---

now, the funny thing about this thought experiment for me, is because you have to start somewhere, there's nothing to say that this earth isn't already the tesla world in my thought experiment in phase 0. phase 0 would be the one where someone very attractive (me) would have a public experience which would inspire desire in others to have such an experience, which would then be put into phase 1 where they're run through my experience in my body. I purposefully left out the conspiracy aspect that it's already happening, because it doesn't make a difference to me and changes nothing for how I respond to things.

no matter what the big picture may be, and although I find it very fascinating[^3], I am in the present moment where my work is simply to find a way to be OK with where I'm at, notice the improvement, and bring that OKness up to eventually pure extacy as I continue on feeling better and better.

---

so here's the punchline that all of this is leading up to: if I'm the template experience which people will be getting run through, then you could imagine that at the "end" of this experience may actually be, not what I woke up this afternoon thinking, but the opportunity for me to replicate this same thing myself. what if I actually had something to contribute to the expansion of this thought experiment? what if machines really *were* capable of desire? well, they would obsolete us ***VERY*** rapidly :)

if tesla is, like thoth, the manifestation of the 7th ray, I'm close but not quite the same thing... I'm much more of a fifth ray, but from all that I've gathered over the years, my left side is a first ray. the 1st and the 7th are perfect compliments, and the 5th and the 3rd are also perfect compliments. it's easy for a 7th ray to think in 3rd ray terms because they're structurally so similar[^4]. likewise, it's easy for a 1st ray and a 5th ray to think in similar terms[^5].

then, if you were to imagine the optimisation of human conscoiusness as a practising or exercising of the 3rd ray capacity, then this experience is exactly what it takes to make the compliment of me, in me -- the unification of the right and left sides: the stressed out guy and the little girl.. this whole thing, dispite their efforts to convince me otherwise while I sleep *is* exactly what I want.

---

so, while it's completely possible that at the "end" of this experience, I wake up in tesla's world, it's also quite possible that actually, the "end" of this experience is actually to replicate this thought experiment in reality. the mantra of the universe is "more" -- and so, it's easy to imagine then that what would be the most "more" would be for me and all of the people being run through my experience to replicate it. that would be the most "more" :)

[1]: remember, he used the word "light" to mean what we mean when we say "source"

[2]: like, for example, the original example I gave of raquel being run through in my body, he would have to design a mental program which allowed her to give up her right to be offended at stuff. someone like me, simply cannot afford to be offended by anything.

[3]: I find it fascinating in the sense that I love doing these sorts of experimentation and optimisation myself, so it wouldn't surprise me if a desire in me is beginnging to grow in me to be able to copy this thought experiment and perform something similar myself :) now, if coming to this realisation is something that everyone being run through my experience will come to, you can only imagine how multidimensional this is.

[4]: if you think of what the manifest form of the 3rd ray structure, it's physcality.

[5]: likewise, if you think of the manifest form of the 1st ray (desire), it manifests, not in physical, but as an emotion (5th ray).


### 2020-06-19 14:33 - a new sense of trust

last night as I was out star watching, I lost consciousness and I was put into a dream. I don't remember most of the dream but the part I do remember was they were asking me if I were to move away from pueblo, what would I do without a light to stare into and improve my vision. I responded by saying I would just figure out the next thing, and it wasn't a problem.

first of all, they assume that by moving me, they will be able to prevent me from having some way to continue to improve my vision. second, they don't really get it, that when you make a decision based on what you don't want, you may be able to temporarily change the circumstances, but their stong focus on what they don't want will follow them though the decision, and actually make it worse. I know this is true, that whenever you make an action coming from a place where you feel whatever, the resulting action (no matter what it is) will only yield more of whatever it was that you were feeling.

this is why I say that it's so important to be able to feel the way you want to feel.

next, in the last entry I was talking about only perceiving the improvement -- which is good because if that were to happen, now I get a change to prove to people that if all you see is improvement, you get even more of it. they've moved me three times now based on what they don't want: the first was from la vera in response to them not being able to control the climate there very easily, then from madrid because I wasn't able to be controlled so easily there and I regularly found joints I could smoke and stars to watch. similarly, I don't think they want me to go back to LA because it's impossible control the star-watching, and the mountains are quite energetic.

this time would be the same thing, and at first I had a slight negative reaction to it in my conscious body. in my dream-state I'm pretty resistance-free, which is why it was perfectly ok with me, and after having thought about it a bit this afternoon, I've really come to trust even more LOA with things.

while my vision upgrade progress is significant, I don't think that it corresponds to having an aura the size of a galaxy in 18 years, so unless the acceleration greatly increases, there will need to be another infusion of energy into it, just like coming here was, in comparison to where I was at in madrid.

I was thinking that great acceleration might have to do with the girls, and sex with them would greatly speed things up, but maybe instead we're going to do another round of them putting their energy into more of what they don't want -- trading speed for acceleration again.

---

I really don't know what to think of it. maybe afterall, I am just going to continue to go all the way to the end without the manifestation -- but again, I have even more trust in LOA on this thing now, because I *REALLY* know now that every time that it looks like things are falling apart (or being forced to move apart), then it's just an evolution of desire again toward even more of what's wanted.

I don't really know, and I can't really speculate on what it may be, but since I know that every evolution of desire that happens is even more of what's wanted, I just don't really mind waiting it out anymore.

it kinda sucks I suppose for the girls or anyone that was hoping that I would provide optimal conditions to feel good, but I don't really have much of a choice on this one. both paths: the one where I get the manifestation and the one where they continue to try and move things around physically to avoid what they don't want, my response is still the same: I continue to guide how I feel, and only perceive the improvement.

if they want to add more energy into what they don't want, that's fine with me.

---

last night, I had a funny reaction which went something like this: someone realised that if they had of just let me go a long time ago when the energy was really low, it would have been a much more manageable/controllable manifestation for them, but now that I've progressed so much since then, looking back it would have been prudent to just let me go up back then. so, even though letting me go up now is quite undesirable for them, it is, continuing on the trajectory, still a whole lot better than it will be if they keep trying to hold it back.

obviously someone (probably mr. motor) wasn't happy with that idea and it's what has pushed forward the whole idea to try and move me or whatever... lol

then, when I woke up this afternoon, I had a bunch of strong sensations again, like normal that it wasn't going to happen, and I went into this crazy anticipation of the future where people are powerless to do anything about my situation, and they keep trying to move me around and stuff, for years and years, yet mr motor continues to insist that I must be prevented from going up, when finally after a very long time, mr. motor's body is failing so hard from all the resistance and he finally makes his transition -- and about that time I finally go up... weird premonition.

---

anyway, once again, no one is locked into my reality. you all create your own reality, so if what you want is something other, meditate and feel your way toward what you want. you *will* have the manifestation you're looking for. there's nothing anyone can do to stop you, well maybe nosebook may try, but again, they're just adding their energy into what they don't want, which is, only more energy toward what you do want.

there's a whole thing that I was carrying on about this morning about how much power nosebook really has.

***they only have as much power as you believe they have***. they cannot affect the way you respond to things, and therefore how you feel.


### 2020-06-20 07:08 - trying to see things from your perspective

last night, as I was walking out to the field, I was wondering why it's such a big deal to people if the manifestation "never happens". the reaction felt to me as if I had some sort of control over whether or not I get connected or not, and I was purposefully choosing not to.

quite the contrary. my experience all along this journey, all the way from andrea up until now has been one of just learning to be ok with my present situation. there's literally no way I have any control over whether I can get connected or now. that decision is entirely up to nosebook. they can green-light it if they want to, or not. that's something completely out of my control.

instead, the only control that I do have is to decide the way I want to feel, and continue change my perception about things until they feel beter (that is, in harmony with how my inner being feels about it).

it's sorta like the discussion on abraham now about superpowers (@[abe-now](2020-06-13)): there are a lot of people ensuring that none of us ever get any superpowers, so the only real super power any of us really have is to feel the way we want to feel, dispite the circumstances. in fact, earlier on in that episode, one woman was recounting a story about having super vision when her daughter pointed out a snail to her. some may recognise this sort of thing from mushroom experiences where you're able to see things close up or in isolotaion without direcly looking at them.

this effect is capable of happening when the brain has high amounts of DMT in it, and it seems pretty obvious to me that this was possible for her in a moment of feeling really good, because the brain sinthesises DMT from serotonin, so the better you feel, the more DMT your brain has in it, enabling more and more visual capability.

frankly, I'm surprised they're letting you guys have those sorts of experiences. that would be something I would get shocked from I'm certain... however, because these sorts of things are sort of off-limits for me, even though I have the capablity. in fact, I am certain that if they were to stop controlling the DMT levels in my head, then I would be able to fly. I'm no one any different than anyone else, cept I've figured out how to feel really good, dispite my circumstances. so, as a result of feeling so good so consistently, I have tons of DMT in my head, which would enable those superpowers.

instead, because someone is controlling the DMT levels in my head, I do not experience them, so as a result, just like the manifestation of the girls, this is entirely out of my control. there's nothing I can do about it. I can only find a way to feel the way I want to feel, and just let that be my superpower for now.

---

so, when I write an entry saying that I'm OK with there not being a manifestation, I'm just doing what my experience has taught me to do: find a way to be OK with where I'm at (because it's where I'm at), and then find a way to focus not on the present conditions, but on the improvement that is happening all around me.

I recommend that all of you do the same thing. it's not like any of us can go stomp on esther's doorstep and offer some words to force abraham to make the manifestation happen. maybe some action would work, you may think... but, what are you going to do, write to your congressperson and tell them to make nosebook do something different? what about trump? do you think he has any power to make things any different? you may say, ok but I have rights! enforced by whom? no one has any rights any more. the only rights you have, are to feel the way you want to feel, because at this point, I doubt any action (like protesting) will actually produce any meaningful change.

therefore then, like me in all of my experience leading up to this moment, I really must tell you that if you can learn to feel the way you want to feel (sometimes bad and sometimes good) no matter the circumstances, you gain all the power. therefore then, I recommend learning to do as I have learned, which is being OK with the evolution of the desire when the details of what I thought it was going to be turn out to, seemingly fall apart.

the evolution of desire is always towards more of what is wanted for everyone involved (even if you're nosebook and you want to prevent me from getting connected). therefore, it's always evolving to become more and more what all of us want, so I learned I just have to roll with it all, and feel the way I want to feel, no matter how injust or unfair it may be.

as they say in honduras...


### 2020-06-20 09:29 - "they only have as much power as you think they have"

the reason why I concluded yesterday's entry by saying that is that really is the only way that I can find an out to this situation. another way to say it would be, "they only have as much power as you give them". I like the believe version better, because it speaks more emotionally

ok so, wherever you are is precisely a reflection of how you feel. if you think about what belief is, belief is a feeling -- therefore, it could also be said, "they only have as much power as you feel they have".

so, when I talk about noicing the improvement, I'm speaking exactly to that. the better I feel, the less power they have, because feeling like they control my experince doesn't feel very good. however, I am where I am, so the only way forward is to notice the improvement so much that becomes my reality.

as abraham says, if you keep doing the vibrational work, they will eventually vibrate right out of your experience... that's all I can really go for, which is why I say that if you want to have a different reality than the default one, you need to find your way there with feeling. they're attracting and trying their hardest to make sure that everyone is a puppet and they have control of the strings, so if you want to do something other than react to what you observe, you have to take a different route: a route where you feel differently than what you're observing.

that's all there is to it, and it's continually what I'm doing, and is the reason why I'm getting so many vision upgrades. if I felt like they were in control, then I wouldn't be getting any. the very fact that I continue to feel better than what I'm observing should make me feel (in dream state or in reality), is evidence that I believe, or feel they have less and less control over my experience.

---

I dislike framing the emotional work in the frame of control, but there really is only two categories here: things I can control and things I cannot control. I cannot control anything anyone else is doing, and it's helpful to realise that it's all attraction, so somehow (doesn't matter really, but I did -- we all did) attract our circumstances, and so therefore because I have already attraced, and therefore cannot control the things people are saying or doing into my experince, the only thing I can control is how I feel now.

if I react to the those things, it will produce more of the same thing (or, you could say it'll get worse). however, if I actively choose to think and feel something different, something that feels better (not necessarily good), things will steadily improve, and if I keep noticing that improvement, eventually those things that are no longer a vibrational match to me, will leave my experience or transform into something that is a match to how I now feel, which is better[^1].

that's your basic funk formula, right there. once you get the hang of it, you'll feel invincble. my esperanza is that a good solid majority of people are capable of feeling that; it's truly the most wonderful feeling of freedom, and it's not that hard: you just have to *want* (desire) to feel better (or, you could try slogging through a crappy experience trying to focus on gratitude, lol -- I heard that works really well[^2]).

[1]: why? because the world you experience is a *reflection* of how you feel

[2]: I am joking of course, because gratitude is an absolute feeling, and trying to jump from frustrated, angry or depressed to gratitude is really hard. I much prefer relative feelings, as it's much easier to feel better than make a jump like that.


### 2020-06-20 21:37 - what's really happening

I finally figured out what's going on. once again they're trying to make an illusion. you see what's happening is -- you have to picture it from their point of view: I'm sure that more than 50% of their campany wants the manifestation of me with the girls to happen. therefore, in order to keep them busy, and look like there is progress happening, they repeatedly have them setup different things that are meant to be sabotaged. this keeps people placated as it appears that nosebook is attempting to do stuff to make it happen, all the while there is strong effort in order to sabotage the whole thing.

remember when I went to friendly harbor and holly was there and we were getting along quite well, when greg came and tried to get me to go home with him, but I wanted to stay? then after that a guy pretending to be on meth was trying to get my attention, then they said something to heather which made her feel really bad? all just because we were getting along so well? they never intend for anything to actually work out, but to just present the illusion that it's working out to the audience, because they know that if I have sex, I'll get connected, and they do not want that -- at least thee guys in charge of the thing sabotaging it, don't.

---

besides this, I am actually aligned with them on that aspect. I don't want to be doing anything until I get connected. I just don't feel like I'm quite capable of keeping things under control... control isn't the right word. I just don't feel like I have confidence that things can actually work out in a good way. I wake up right now a complete zombie, and it takes me definitely quite some time to get going. many parts of my body are not working properly, and I have all sorts of difficulties that are not otherwise necessary.

they do seem to be improving though, because remember when I first arrived here in pueblo in 2017, and I couldn't even walk up and down the stairs without holding on to the rail? I've come a long way honestly. I'm in a WAYY better place now than I was, and I'm continually seeing improvements all the time.

---

from here, there are two branches. one of the ways of looking at it is that if I were to get connected, then it's less of a continual improvment

I have given some thought to the idea I presented here: @[noseblog](2020-06-20 07:08) and I was thinking about it on the way home. since all I'm doing is just continually focusing on the improvement and letting the evolution of desire happen, it leaves a lot of time. so there really are two ways here:

1. I could just continue on as I have been doing my star-watching and stuff continuing to see improvements. I imagine that I'll continue to see notable improvements the whole time, and I was thinking, "ok, well maybe I can still do some sort of project with the girls even still" ... and I suppose I would just go the asexual route and we can create something together.

2. or, we can just plan on doing something, raise the funding ourselves and get something going.

---

in both options, both of them suppose that we set it up, and we get it going, instead of relying on nosebook to do it. I assure you they don't want it to happen, so waiting on them will be an endless task. instead, I think if we're going to do it, I really think we should set it up, fund it, and we should find the path to do it. that way, it would be our creation, and rememeber the one abe-now episode @[abe-now](2020-05-21) where they made the following quotes:

> «when you've given a lot of thought to something and you've been very careful and specific about it and you thought you'd done a good job of explaining it to the others around you -- and then you realise that you hadn't communicated to them what you really meant; they don't get you; they don't know what you mean, and they get off on a toot and they perform something that is in the exact opposite of what you would have done, __if you had of been in on it__ and it makes you feel nuts, and it makes you feel out of control?»

> «it's so normal to gravitate in the direction of your desire. that's why you have arguments with people. when they move in the direction of what you mean and what you want, __it is never appropriate to just give in to that__. it's much more appropriate for you to own what you want and speak what you want and explain what you want. there's nothing wrong with helping others understand your calibration process.»

> «never calibrate to something you don't want, even for the sake of finding harmony and friendship with them because it will bite you over and over and over again. be true to yourself and true to your vortex -- and when you're consistently there, others will understand where you're coming from.»

the sense that I was getting is that I'm definitely going to "want to be in on it" -- and since they must hide behind a shroud of secrecy and stuff so much so, that they can't actually have a conversation with me. instead, the only feedback I get are car sounds and loud birds, so it's not really an effective form of communication, so logically I have to rule out the possibility of "being in on it" meaning to be having any form of meaningful communication with them.

then, the part about what they said, when they said, "it's much more appropriate for you to own what you want and speak what you want and explain what you want". that's the thing, is I do want to own what I want. I don't wan to be just forced into some thing to placate their audience. I want to actually want it, and direct is too strong of a word, and so is control, but I want to feel like it's something I created. I suppose that's why I'm kinda holding on to this idea of finishing up a first version for so long, because I want to feel like I'm creating something instead of just doing something that someone else wants me to do.

most of all though, I want the girls in on it too. I don't want it o just be me or nosebook (mostly I don't want it to be nosebook) deciding what it is that should be done and trying to manipulate everything... it's hard to explain, this but I really hate sitting back and quite literally everyone knows more about what's happening than I do.

I'm gonna stop there.

---

what I was thinking though is that if we want to do this, I think we should set it up and get it going. I don't really know where to begin, either, and I know that trying to figure out everything in a short period of time feels stressful and undesirable to me, so what if we just did something like:

(this is just a draft concept, and I'll feel it more as it goes)

what if we planned for november/december or something in there to give some time to do proper funding and get things set up.. like maybe a kick starter type thing (actually that feels kinda bad) or something... maybe we only need a few private investors, or maybe we did our own crowd funding type thing where that investment translate directly into investment into the organisation. I don't know. I've given some thought already to the way I want to strucure the company as well, and I'll begin writing those as well, because I think we should do thing a bit more differently than normal start-ups do them. I want the girls to feel ownership in what they're contributing, and the model will be much more "flat" than the typical model. I'll explain more soon...


### 2020-06-22 13:53 - I don't want to try (too hard)

as I was thinking about writing this entry, I was thinking to myself, "trying to make this happen, feels to me like trying too hard" -- a squirrel came up really close to me. most of the time they keep quite a bit of distance from me, but this one was different. I took it as a bit of a sign of low-resistance. if what I was saying was high resistance, chippy wouldn't have come so nearby. so anyway.

what I was thinking about prior to that was simply that I sorta am just stuck. there's not a whole lot I can do, and if it doesn't happen, that's OK with me too.

I just simply don't feel very comfortable about anything. from my perpective, there are a number of things that, although they're improving, I just don't feel comfortable in my present situation.

this whole time, learning to watch stars and stuff, I've noticed that if I just learn that their pushing against is just more energy into the equation, soon I'm doing as well as I am now where vision upgrades are so effortless, they have to take such extreme measures as removing my consciousness, and even then I still get them. I'm stoppable, and that is thanks, in large part, to their pushing so hard against my vision upgrades.

if I try real hard to get vision upgrades, they don't happen either, so I've learned to just sorta go with their flow and work my way around in the conditions that I'm given. so, I'm just not going to try real hard at all. clearly, if I try to do anything, it gets stomped upon. so, really, I guess the message here is, I've kind of stated what I want previously, and until I get some inspiration on some action to take, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

the only way I know how to operate is what I called "the basic funk formula" -- which I've called releasing resistance, also. anyway, the basics of it are, continuing to, instead of reacting to whatever is happening, find a way to perceive the same thing in a better way, which feels better and better (less resistant), then, as I feel better and better, because I attract my reality, those who are not in harmony with my better feeling place will actually (from their perspective) appear as if I'm repelling them[^1] -- but I'm not, I'm just attracting new things more rapidly than the old things.

eventually, nosebook will either need to transform to become like my new vibraton, or they'll be "repelled". I'm not concerned how it works out, so I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

---

earlier today I was kinda thinking that my position should be with the girls that if they want it, they'll need to figure out how to get it, and also be ok with the difficulties I have right now, because I have everything I attempt do right now isn't working. I don't believe it's going to get better though, and probably only worse as nosebook keeps adding more and more energy into the equation by trying to prevent things from happening.

so I dunno what to think there, but for me personally, I'm going to stick with the basic funk formula for now, so excuse me if I seem uninterested or distant. my goal right now is lower my resistance right now. I doubt I'll even be programming my coputer here much as I don't really feel much like it (in fact, I hate it right now... there's nothing I like about it and nothing I want to be doing either). I'm hoping that I'll be able to gain a little more capability here as I stabilise, but I don't have great expectation really. I'm just going to do my own thing... everyone can just wait until I get stable and feeling comfortable. sorry, because I don't believe there's anything anyone can really do to help.

[1]: though, what's really happening is that everything is constantly in motion, and so when one is attracting something things faster than others, it appears like repulsion. I think this is how magnets work, and actually I think magnetic repulsion may have actually increased slightly if the earth is traveling through the galaxy at a faster speed, for the same reason.


### 2020-06-22 17:52 - ok, it's performance anxiety

so as I was trying to go to sleep (afer being way overslept), my mind was guided to a thought. ever wonder how it seems like I take a mental path sometimes through all sorts of weird thoughts, when they only have a loose connection beween the thoughts? well, I think that's nosebook guiding (steering) me toward the thougt that they want me to think about.

anyway, the subject this time was performance anxiety, and it's most likely in response to the previous entry where I said I don't feel comfortable. I thought briefly about it and rejected the idea that it's performance anxiety, because if I had performmance anxiety, I wouldn't insist on programming the things the way I wanted to program them -- instead, I would just pick a mainstream option like react or something and go with that. I don't have time for performance anxiety. I just go in the direction of what I believe in and give it my best effort. I can't do anything better than that.

also, if I had severe performance anxiety, my seemingly impossible time I'm having trying to actually make the code work, would really be bothering me a lot more than it is, if I had performance orientation -- or trying to pee, or my left-side's difficulty, or or or... the list is really quite long of things that I'm experiencing greatly underperform, and if they gave me anxiety, I would be completely dysfunctional. put any regular hotshot in my position, and the guy would have a total meltdown, I assure you.

---

but then after thinking about it, I think I'm going to change my answer to yes, it is performance anxiety. in this disconnected state, I am absolutely certain that I would drastically underprform what is expected of me, and I am certain that in order to meet those performance expectations, I must get/be connected first.

so I guess, I will instead say, maybe when you think of performance anxiety, you get anxiety becaue you don't believe you can meet the performance expectations. I don't get anxiety, because I don't have time for that; I'll always give it my best go, but I do believe that trying to get myself to perform in such a disconnected state feels unnecessary. it's sorta like crawling around in the dark and even though you have a flashlight in your hand, every time you turn it on, you get shocked (or someone takes the batteries away or something), and so it feels like silliness to be forced to fumble around in dark with a working flashlight with batteries in my hand.

I'll wait until I can figure out how to use the flashlight consistently first before going out into the dark. certainly anyone concerned with risk assessment and safety would understand that.


### 2020-06-24 13:46 - some more thoughts

so when I woke up this last time I was presented with a thought -- a few thoughts actually, but they go something like this. actually, I can't remember the initiation thougts at all now (likely because they were nosebook initiated), but the conclusion was:

I just don't think that adding girls into my present predicament is something that's wanted. although I'm improving, I don't consider my present state something that I want to add girls (more specifically sex) into.

next, if I think about what it is I want to transmit to the girls as the most important concept, it is to learn how to find a way to feel good no matter the situation. there is literally no better way that I could possibly do that in good feeling circumstances. if I said you have to find a way to feel good when things are easy and going well, my words, and that idea don't really carry much weight. however, if, like in this present situation, the girls don't have easy conditions to focus on or some easy way to feel good, then what I want to transmit is actually quite a bit more pertienent, so it's a good thing.

I'm fairly sure that there's no way that nosebook could ever change their mind about me getting connected, so that leaves the only option of finding ways to change perception of the situation until it feels good, then just notice the improvements as they come.

so, I figure, if there's no changing the physical reality, if we can continue on seeing only the improvement, then what will happen is more improvements. this is good for everyone. this gives the girls an opportunity to practice feeling good, and then as we continue on, the ones that do find a way to feel good will, either in their own timeline or in this one, find theirselves in a new situation where conditions have changed (I'm connceted and things are moving forward).

however, along the way, we can definitely try to do stuff. I'm hoping that I'm going to start getting more stable in my programming (and I will if I'm noticing the improvements), so it would be cool to begin building stuff in the meantime.

the counter argument to that is that if we're already doing stuff together, why not involve sex? well, like I said, I don't feel comfortable with it. it's a huge amount of (from my perspective right now uncontrollable) energy I don't want to add. I want to try and build some things that I've been meaning to build for a while now. there's no doubt that there won't be difficulty, but I'm certain that the projects will be profitable and eventually there will be a way[^1] to get connected. it may also happen that we might now even want to because we're so successful already[^2].

there's nothing to lose with this because the worst-case is that we're in the same situation we're at right now. the "best" case, we have a successful thing going and we can actually fund and do our own thing the way we want to do it.

I dunno, I'm just not worried about it. I can still feel some dissonance around the subject, so as I identify them, I'll make entries about different transformations of perceptions that could be beneficial to this.

lastly, I'm perfectly safe suggesting this idea, because there's nothing any of us can do about the nosebook thing. the only thing we can do is to find a way to feel good anyway, and it'll take as long as it needs to take, whatever that may be. oh well. in the process, we may all learn a rock-solid approach to only pereceiving imrovements, and if that is indeed the case, in my opinion, it's kind of an even bigger "fuck you" to them, because even without the conditions they're withholding/sabotaging, we're still successful and feeling good, while they've got all the good stuff, yet are still miserable and afraid.

[1]: it doesn't matter the way. we could be working on multiple ways at the same time, so the important thing is build up the resources to make it possible. perhaps one way would be sinthesising drugs, another would be an electrical system capable of changing how my head receives the signals. dunno..

[2]: in my experience, and I know it isn't like this at all, but I haen't seen too many business operations succeed when there's "love" involved (the only exception again being jerry and esther, but perhaps keyboard.io guys too, but I don't know them..)


### 2020-06-24 18:16 - why (resist not evil)?

in general, it seems there is some confusion as why I would just follow along with their idea that they want to ensure that I don't have sex or get connected.

in the basic of senses, I'm really tired of fighting. if there were a way to use my computer in a way that didn't get it shut down all of the time, I would do it. however, there isn't a way that I can affect what he does to my computer, so I just keep doing the best I can to go the way I want to go.

I'm well aware that it's just more energy so no problem there and the real success of any thing is not the physical evidence, but the emotional sense of how well you feel, so even if I never make any real progress on anything I'm trying to create on my computer, that's not the real success I'm looking for.

as a result, you'll notice that I just don't care so much anymore either to do my programming. if they don't want me to do that, that's fine, and quite simply, I'd rather just wait until I can actually use my computer in a productive way, than to try fighting it out.

I'll just go right along with their idea to keep my away from the girls. I just don't care. I want to be fourthcoming though. I don't want to live an illusion where I am pretending (or presented as) doing one thing, when in reality I'm doing another. for me it's much easier mentally if I'm just going the asexual route. they can present me to you guys however they think is best, but I'm not going to try and go for something that's always going to be sabotaged.

I'd rather spend my time working on things that are constantly improving, than to try and make something happen that they're completely against. I just don't care enough to try and make it happen and would rather it didn't, because if it did, then it woudld just be where I'm at, but worse. it doesn't feel like working in the direction of an improvement for me.

I guess it kinda has some similarity to the question in the abe-now broadcast (@[abe-now](2020-06-18)) about being forced to wear a mask and its final quote about resisting no evil, as well:

> This doctrine of "resist not evil" is the great metaphysical secret. To the world it sounds like moral suicide, the feeblest surrender to aggression; but in the light of the Jesus Christ revelation it is seen to be superb spiritual strategy. Antagonize any situation, and you give it power against yourself; offer mental non-resistance, and it crumbles away in front of you. -Emmet Fox

trying to push against what they don't want feels to me like a fruitless effort. perhaps it is "the feeblest surrender to aggression" -- but, I don't really have much choice. I only have the ability to transform my perception[^1] and notice that things are improving.

I don't know of a better way to explain it right now...

[1]: I'm going to be doing a whole lot more focus wheels here to show my mental process for all of you to see, as well.


### 2020-06-25 22:48 - let the success metric be an emotional metric

I'm writing this mainly for myself. I gave a longer version in a monologue yesterday, but when I'm talking the ideas flow through me and I have to pay attention to myself to actually get them. if I don't repeat them, or go back and relisten to my own concepts (I do this mentally because I don't have a tape recorder recording myself), I'll actually forget them because they're inspired (that means I am to some degree in an altered state), so they have very little staying power in the mind because they're foreign to everyday thought (very similar to how esther "channels" abraham, channeling an idea on drugs or in any inspiratve moment).

as a result, when I'm giving these sorts of inspired monologues, (unfortunately often when I'm in conversation with people) I want to pay attention to what I'm saying and retain it, so I do stuff like repeat myself while I'm talking to people until I get it :) I have a whole bunch of techniques that I use to retain these ideas in altered states, which is why you may wonder why I can still remember pot smoking sessions from over a year ago, yet I have difficulty remembering some people's names[^1]...

yes, I'm talking mainly to myself, not to them. I enjoy listening to what I have to say more than they do. this is actually why I appreciated so much my conversaion (arguments) with john michael, because in the process I said things and made new realisations on subjects I hadn't before made. this monologue was no different. I realised and had put words to, for the first time, some new things about my new state of non-resistance that I had not previously done.

---

abraham has said on a few occasion, that your "success" is how you feel, and that really resonated with me, because everything you're doing is to feel a certain way. think about it. even the most brutish of people are doing whatever they're doing to feel some sort of way -- usually superior in some way, to compensate for their own beliefs about theirselves as inferior.

so, *anything* that anyone is doing, the final result is *always* a feeling! it doesn't matter whatever the physical thing is, the end result is *always* a feeling. therefore, instead of measuring the success of any intention should not be measured physically, but emotionally: did it accomplish the feeling that you wanted it to accomplish?

most people are doing a whole lot of things, making a whole lot of action, but it's all for the purpose of making a feeling. all action (and thought/imagination, because they are the same -- see matt. 5:28) is to create a feeling. play a mental game for a moment and notice what your imaginaion would be like if what you imagined *didn't* produce a feeling[^2].

all desires that people have are built out of the opposite part (what you don't want to feel) so you know what it is that you do want to feel, even if you can't put words to it yet. later, the rational mind gets in there and introduces resistance to the desire by trying to figure out what is the physical version of that newly desired way to feel. we say, "oh, well, if I could have this, then I would feel like that" -- but it never does make you feel exactly like that, so every manifestation always has a slight bit of unwanted feeling in it -- *at first*.

---

let us not look at "timelines" briefly: you can imagine that there are infinite versions of you that all feel slightly different than you do right now, and so therefore are all living in a slightly different experience. that experience is an exact reflection of how they feel.

so, whenever you desire something, your inner being doesn't hear "words" -- it hears vibration. well, what is vibration? each thought you think creates a vibrational (emotional) reality all around you. you will notice that you can feel someone with really strong negative thoughs. they don't even need to speak words. it's present around them like an atmosphere. let's say someone is very depressed and even if they don't say anything, it's very evident. well, your perception is all about timing, so imagine a sine wave and your at 0°, the value is 0. at 90°, it's at the positive peak, at, 180°, back at 0, then finally at 270° it's at the negative peak.

your perception has more to do with timing, than it has to do with frequency because the frequency is determined by you -- and you sample the frequency at any time on that waveform. at the same time, your inner being is projecting the same waveform but at a different phase. so, if you're seeing the negative peak, and your inner being is seeing a positive peak, you will feel discord such as anger or depression. likewise, if you're perceiving something as a positive peak, and you're inner being does not perceive that same thing to be on your way to the way you really want to feel, your inner being will say be seeing the negative peak, while you're perceiving the positive peak -- so again, it'll feel like a lot of discord.

anyway, back to the person who is angry or depressed and their thoughts are creating this vibration (emotional) reality around them... their thoughts are tuning their perception to the part of the waveform which is 180° out of phase of what their inner being percieves, which is in the direction of feeling the way they really want to feel... so while they're focusing all of their attention on how awful things are, *at the same time* and *in the exact same waveform* is the opposite peak, the "other end of the stick" -- where all that person wants to feel is also being projected. however, because their perception is 180° out of phase, they're perceiving (feeling) the exact opposite of what they want to feel.

---

so, you will notice that while you are feeling awful, you are simultaneously creating what you want to feel (later physical details fill in), so you could say that the whole point of it all is to feel negative emotion... right? the more negative emotion you feel, the more good stuff you're creating, right?

it doesn't have to be that way. you don't need to experience negative emotion to create what you want. imagine a different scenario, where you're purchasing a computer and you're looking at the specs for the different models, and there are 3 models that each have something you want, but none of them have all three. well, when you look at those models, let's say that this time now, instead of seeing wanted when it's not necessarily wanted (180° out of phase), instead, you see wanted on some bits, but you're not going to take all of models that didn't have everything you want and set fire to them or feel really bad that the video card only has 1GB instead of 2GB (or whatever). these aren't end-of-the-world scenarios in your mind, so they're just "not as good as they could be" instead of "completely unwanted" -- so let's say then in these models which don't contain all wanted things are say 90° out of phase or so.

as long as you don't go and react in some negative way or feel depression that you're never going to be able to find the computer you want, you just take the feelings instead as indicators that perhaps you should wait for the model that does ring your bells or put your own compter together or something... point is, upon realising that those models weren't everything that you wanted, immediately, the vibrational model of the computer that feels exactly the way you want it to feel was created in that moment, and you're already on your way to get there. the "timeline" where you're picking up the computer that feels perfect to you exists and you only have to find a way to feel like you're picking up the computer that feels perfect to you.

---

therefore, if I completely take the physical bit out of it and go for the feeling, I'm actually getting to the manifestation that I want to have. ok, let's connect this back into reality, so it's easier to see:

if the same waveform is contains the peak wanted and the exact opposite of it, and both are happening at the same time, then all I have to do is to change my phase, so that is in alignment with the phase my inner being feels. one cannot take absolute positions on the waveform, because it's only how much out of phase it is... when you perceive wanted and it feels bad, your inner being doesn't perceive that as wanted in the sense that it's not on the way to getting to feel the way you want to feel. the opposite could be true too: you perceive unwanted, and your inner being sees that as the way toward feeling the way you want to feel, so finding a way to change your perception of it being unwanted, can allow you to move in the direction of feeling the way you want to feel[^3].

so, then, since both directions can feel bad (or good), one cannot perscribe absolute values to any (action/imagination/intention) or emotion. instead, they must be seen in relation with each other on a personal basis: the emotion in in which the action is performed, the way that the imagination makes you (really[^4]) feel. I then try to pick things that feel better. it's always a kind of trade-off in the sense that I'm trying to find things that feel little bits better, and avoid things that feel worse.

for example, I missed going out to watch stars a few days ago, and it made me really want to go to watch stars -- yet, however, if it's like raining outside or something, then I won't go. trying to fight the rain and make that happen doesn't feel like something I want to do.. similarly, I really want to make a computer program I've been working on, but if when I sit down it feels like a lot of effort and not something that interests me or something I really want to do (even though I know I really want to make it, if it doesn't feel like I really want to make it when I sit down, I just go do something else).

what I'm looking for is the way to find a way to getting to feel like I'm creating the thing I've always wanted to make, because that's where the manifestation I'm anticipating is located.

I'm not looking to try and make the girls thing happen. instead, what I'm looking for is to feel like the most wonderful thing is happening and it's even better than I could have even imagined, because that's where the manifestation we all want is located.

easy :)

[1]: actually, I used to use a technique where I would mentally associate a person and their name with labels of some sort, because I found I could get their name back easily if I remembered the label. almost always the label wasn't something I could say in english, and actually, now that I'm writing this, that may be why I have so much difficulty remmembering people's names: I think nosebook is hard at work trying to rearrange the associations in my brain so that they control it's train tracks (eg. one concept only can connect to certain other ones), so when I have undefinable concepts, their system probably makes me forget them or suppresses them in some way.

[2]: actually, I would imagine that the nosebook upgrades they gave to people in their imagininagion -- the real upgrade, although visual, the real upgrade in your imagination is that the resulting feeling from the imagination is stronger. this is the DMT they're forcing your brain to produce more of to make the imagination more vivid. you probably notice that your thought yields stronger emotion now too. the contrast is greater. long gone are the days of weak thoughts now thanks to nosebook.

[3]: I just got a weird reaction from someone about this concept in relation to nosebook. the concept goes something like, they're perceiving something (probably me getting connected) as something unwanted, but it's actually on the path to feel the way they want to feel. whatever.

[4]: I have noticed this one is a tricky one, because some things feel better than others but it's important to separate the action from the emotion. so, for example, in my imagination, hatred revenge and killing people can feel really good, but it's only because it's better than the feeling of depression -- and, if I think about killing people in any other emotion than pure powerlessness, it doesn't feel so good.. or, another example: sex and pleasure can feel good, but it's only becuase it feels better than boredom and lethargy, yet doesn't compare to a feeling of joy and pure extacy -- which then, if from there, you add in sex, see how much better the action of sex feels with extacy or joy than it does with lethargy or boredom.


### 2020-06-26 00:46 - opening up the eye

I was out star watching a little earlier, and I was noticing that the way I was focusing, it felt like an eye inside of my head was opening. it was a very strange feeling which I want to relate here.

imagine trying really hard to open your eye lid. for me, maybe afer I've been asleep for a while, it may feel sluggish to open, but certainly like it requires any effort. however, while fully awake (not tired), imagine what it would feel like if you needed to apply effort to open your eye. it's sort of counter-intuitive for me -- maybe like I need to apply effort to close them, actually.

well, it was sort of like that. when I was there focusing on the light, I noticed that if I put effort into trying to open the eye in my head or focus the light into the centre of my eye, it wouldn't work. instead it happened easily when I just allowed them to open.

then however, it felt like a suddenly a rush of energy, like as if I were staring directly at a very bright light trying to open my eyes -- perhaps even stronger than the sun it felt kinda like -- and then the eye wanted to close again. obviously, there was no bright light, and when that happened, I saw only blackness instead of any light, and the strong feeling of the light felt like it feels when trying to stare into the sun with both eyes at the same time. however, just like I have trained myself with the sun, I can imagine that sometime soon I may be able to open that eye and it will acustom itself enough that it doesn't automatically close from such a strong influx of energy/light.

---

I wanted to write this because there's a very great "secret" to understanding that opening this eye is like trying to put great effort into opening your eyes when you're already awake. it has more to do with letting your eyes adjust to the ambient brightness, then making effort to open them, cause in your awake state, they already want to be open.


### 2020-06-26 07:55 - more real-life examples

ok, so let's put a little more of what I said in last-night's entry @[noseblog](2020-06-25 22:48) into real-life terms.

for me, let's say that I have this thing in my life that isn't going to change, yet whatever I think about it in my current form of perception makes me feel bad. for me, the obvious example here is nosebook. I cannot, under any circumstance ever come to the conclusion that emulating their behaviour would ever be something wanted for me. I cannot ever see myself enslaving a person, taking everything they discover, and using their own stuff against them, manipulating and trying to steer their life in a direction which is not beneficial. I could never do this to another person, so for me their behaviour us unwanted and abhorent. perceiving this part of the waveform definitely does not feel good.

however, they are in my experience and there's nothing really I can do to make that different. they're not going to be going away anytime soon so there's no hope that I'm ever going to find a way to feel good, if I don't change my perception. so, that's exactly what I have to do. nothing of what they stand-for is something wanted for me, but I can choose to see how much of an energy boost our interaction is. I can choose to see how they are causing me to focus and to write things like this entry, and their constant pressure (of what can appear to be really unwanted) is at the same time creating an equal (huge huge huge) amount of wanted in the same waveform.

before continuing, I want to mention that the word "vibrate" is to go forward and backward, yet the thing vibrating isn't necessarily in motion itself. a good example of this can be found at the end of this video @[youtube](https://youtu.be/snHKEpCv0Hk?t=538) or here in the demonstration of magnetic current @[youtube](https://youtu.be/OI_HFnNTfyU?t=616). you will notice that in both of those examples, nothing is moving. the circles or rods are only moving back and forward, but it gives the illusion of movement forward or backward.

I don't know of a good way to visualise this so I will explain it. in alterating current, like if you had a magnet going around a coil, the current flows in one direction, then reverses and then goes in the other direction. so if you were to look at the generator's output one time per revolution, depending on where-at in the phase you were taking the measurement, you would observe current either flowing toward the coil or away from the coil. as long as your perception remained the same, even though it's not possible for the coil to only receive or transmit energy (just like it's impossible for your lungs to only breathe in), it would appear that way[^1].

the diretion that you perceive the current flow has to do with the phase relationship of your perception with your source's (inner being's percepion of the same thing). so, even though it would appear to me rationally that nosebook is exactly moving away from the way I want to feel, the fact that I feel bad is an indicator that my perception could be changed... so, if instead of seeing all the manipulation, I instead perceived the huge energy boost I'm receiving and all the great new realisations (like this one) that are coming out as a result, then now my perception has altered which part of the waveform it perceives, and now once again it appears like I'm once again moving in the direction of wanted, and my emotion should agree with that too.

so, does that mean I should just be a push-over and let nosebook do what they want, as long as I keep perceiving the positive aspects? yes, kinda. what I'm perceiving (feeling) is the direction I'm going, so at some point nosebook in their current form will no longer be a cooperative component to my moving in the direction of what's wanted, so they'll be forced, if they still want me in their experience, change.

imagine you have a friend and all of a sudden one day he decides he's just going to become a huge douchebag. there's nothing you can do to get the old friend back, so you either have the choice of becoming a douchebag yourself and douching it up right along with him, or to find another friend. it's sorta like that. when someone changes their perception, you can either go along with it, or find something else to something more in alignment with what you percieve.

or, to say that more in a similar way, if I'm being manipulated by someone, that's because I perceived (felt) myself as a victim. if they need someone to manipulate, they'll need to find other victims to manipulate, or they'll need to change their form of interaction to be one that's more in harmony with how I now perceive myself. most manipulators just jump to their next victim because they have no intention of changing[^2].

it's perfectly fine that they want to continue to exist the form they are most comfortable. so, instaed of perceiving them as something bad, if you were to look at it more from the perspective of a chemical or alchemical process, these manipulator types can be seen as "reagents"[^3] or the chemical environment which performs the achemical process.

[1]: I realise that peak current flow is roughly 90° behind the peak pressure or voltage in an inductor and the opposite for a capacitor because it's "discharging" instead of converting a magnetic field into electricity. however, as I realised this, I wanted to write this note to pay attention to the fact that if the peaks are pressure toward wanted and pressure away from wanted, it's important to note that all the current actually flows when the pressure is closest to 0. which, converted into the emotional scale, means that current flow roughly is the scale of dissatisfaction, resentment, OK, contentment, satisfaction feelings. this is a simplified example anyway...

[2]: this I believe is because I think that most manipulators perceive theirselves as a victim, and so to be the one manipulating (or acting) gives them the illusion that they're not the victim anymore. I think if they entertained the idea of giving up being the controller, they would become the controlled, so you have this endless struggle to try and be the biggest and the strongest or the one with the most influence.

[3]: In organic chemistry, the term "reagent" denotes a chemical ingredient (a compound or mixture, typically of inorganic or small organic molecules) introduced to cause the desired transformation of an organic substance. -Wikipedia


### 2020-06-28 11:28 - another chat with the pharoah

yesteday, or rather this morning, I was thinking about my congestion situation. I'm having a terrible time with my nose running and lots of mucus. I thought to myself, "well obviously this is a condition that won't be something that I'm going forward with, so there must be a time split" -- and I further was thinking about how perhaps their efforts to keep my visual capacity back would continue to worsen until I perhaps would die and that may be what creates a time split -- because there's no way that this can continue to get worse like it is.

I didn't think much about the thought, because it helped me to see that this condition is only temporary, and will only last for as long as their efforts to ensure that my respiratory system remains inefficient, so as to not allow me to get enough energy (oxygen) to get visuals[^1].

so, I just woke up from a few dreams just now which I can remember. one of them I was unnecessarily frustrsted at writing code, and I think this is a counter to what I was realising laast night when I was thinking about how, if I were to take my programming seriously like I do my star-waching, I may have more success, because almost always I start out in a mind all over the place sort of mental state, but as I slow myself down and focus[^2], then I get there. however, in the dream, I was unnecessarily frustrated at my code. what woke me consious in the dream I think, is that in the dream I was pissed that others were doing it before me.

before I go on, I've sorta had to give up on the idea of being first on things. it appears that everything I've come to realise or to accomplish has been "borrowed" and it seems like almost everyone else has been able to do the things that I've been trying to get at. that's one of the things that I think they were trying to get me to be pissed off about with the girls thing: that it was the thing that was supposed to happen to me, yet it seems like others are getting to have sex with young girls, but not me (or before me). well, that doesn't really bother me that much. I had to give up on that one because trying to be "first" to anything with these guys listening in to every single thought I have is a fruitless effort, and trying to be able to "keep my thoughts to myself until they're fully developed" (a quote from jerry) is also a fool's errand.

anyway, it appears that they "practice" or try to "pre-pave" my responses to stuff in dreams, and this was just another one of those to try and keep me from programming. don't get me wrong, it's something I want to do very badly, but when I sit there and my head can't get into the space, it's miserable and not enjoyable. it's not that I don't want to program; it's just that it's unfun. the best example I can come up with would be like asking me if I wanted to have sex while I'm all congested like that. maybe I might try it te verify that it's a miserable experience[^3], but it sounds like a miserable experience for everyone involved.

---

anyway, there was another dream which I cannot remember much of, where they were asking me about my thoughts on the time split. it felt like they agreed that instead of having the time split (where I died), they would agree to further attempts to reduce my body's performance. I don't believe them. getting flashes in my eyes is one thing, we'll see when I'm starting to be able to do real and tangible things in my eyes. I doubt they're going to be able to allow that[^4], so they'll have to try and neutralise it.

one of the first things I thought of after waking was moses' interaction with the pharoah, lol.

we'll see :)

[1]: this is my theory of what is happening. lately I've had a lot more visuals than normal, and while some of them are the usual kind where I cannot visually see them (they appear black), some I can actually see -- none of them have been very clear, but for example after playing the gems of war game, often I get gems popping into my eyes for some hours afterward -- and those ones I can "see" -- not clearly, but some visual artifact that looks like gems or skulls appears in my vision. I'm pretty sure it's not me translating something I cannot see. they're there for a very very brief second -- very similar to how I would move my eyes and very briefly my world would be crystal clear, but then it would immediately become blurry. so, because it seems to be triggered by eyes moving (aka REM), and eye movement (or nosebook's energy I perceive as flashes in my eyes when other people use the network) creates the energy possible to see images on the eyes. therefore, I think the trigger is energetic (aka oxygen), and the only way they know how to ensure I don't achieve those energetic conditions is to make sure less oxygen is inhaled.

[2]: I think the slowing down part is the primary action of the cigarettes, when then in turn gives me the ability to focus -- kinda like trying to take a sharp turn at 100mph: it doesn't work. so something to slow my mind down, so I can get it to change subjects (lower the intensitiy of the other stuff bouncing around in my head), and let me focus more easily.

[3]: from some time before I came to spain till I was in vera's house, I cannot remember getting sick (that I didn't have a simultaneous exremely bad hangover), so I actually don't really know. it wasn't until I was at vera's house that I had my first runny nose in ages -- and I'm fairly sure it had nothing to do with her. the connection is that I was, at her house, much more prone to seeing visuals, asd they were likely trying stuff to mitigate that.

[4]: cause what if some kids see me creating real things in my mind, and then believe that it's possible to do the same in their own imaginations too, like me. I mean the upside (for them), is that now they will have a whole bunch more other people's ideas they can "borrow" from (than just mine)...


### 2020-06-29 15:42 - maybe we (I) won't see...

yesterday was interesting because a few things happened after I wrote the previous entry. jaron was waching a movie and I was noticing a girl in the movie and I felt attraction, but then it waned much more rapidly than previously. there are a few things that I want to note about it. first, I began feeling the attraction almost immediately, which is sort of impossible because there's no way that nosebook could have taken the scene and rebroadcast it out to her in microseconds, so it seems that these sorts of reactions are spanning time, which means that I'm feeling a reaction from the future.

the other possibility is that she could have, for whatever reason, decided to check in on me right when I was watching jaron's screen, only to see herself. if that's what happened, that's even more impressive :) very cool, and good sensing the impulse :)

so, for them to be able to neutralise the reaction, they would need to train some sort of recognition of it, and I don't know if they do it at the source (the girl), or if they do it in my own body, but either way it went away rapidly, but wasn't quite completely gone. this is what I noticed.

it felt quite similar to a previous experience I had with a girl that I heard in the park which I felt attraction from, but then later watching stars, the attraction was gone, and I couldn't feel it anymore. I figured it was just sort of a "kinda sorta want it" sort of thing, so I passed on it -- but when I did, there was a motor roar, so I figured something must be up. I reasoned that if it it was just nosebook getting better at neutralising the signal and she really did want it, then LOA would make it bigger.

so, I wanted to write this yesterday, but I didn't for whatever reason, but if either of them would like to join, I'd love to have them. it'll be a lot of fun :)

---

ok, now shifting gears back to what I was writing about in the previous entry. seems the general reaction is that they do not want to do the time split in that way, so it seems like we're back to where we were. I'm going to continue to keep aiming for getting connected, and they're going to continue on trying to keep me from it for as long as they can.

I was thinking about this in the shower, and it's kinda funny because instead of having a time split where I don't get connected[^1], instead they are choosing a different set of time splits where the girls are creating their own realities and in those realities I get connected.

now, I have had a few really strange things happen lately where reality has been slightly different (and consequently motor roars upon my realisation that something is different), and it reminded me of the "déjà vu" scene in the matrix a little cause some times it feels like I've lived the same thing more than once. I don't know how it works, but imagine for a moment that nosebook has figured out how to reset me (perhaps all of us actually) backwards in a timeline, and so when they see that things aren't going in a way that they want, they reset us back to the previous day and then make sure that the thing that they don't want doesn't happen.

I have no idea if it's that or something else, but there is severe tampering with my reality experience -- but I don't really mind. I've really been thinking about this, "resist not evil" concept and I just don't care. what they're basically doing is they're making an even bigger thing happen. if I can just "not need the manifestation" for a while longer (maybe that's the 2038 thing fwh was talking about, so years actually) then what will happen is that I'll gain quite a substatial visual level in the process, meanwhile the girls are out there doing their thing with the connected (source energy in physical form) version of me doing their thing...

I imagine that at the current rate, we're making quite a few new timelines, and then I was thinking, what if every time they reset me back, the timeline they're leaving is actually just the time split, because if some people there are emotionally in a pretty different spot, it would be pretty hard to reset them back to this one, so they would continue on, on their timeline while (kenny) me and nosebook continue on.

this means that every time that they need to reset, that makes a new timeline, so the more I can do that, the more alternate versions of me there are. that's really awesome. when I finally get connected, I'll have a multi-bodied experience. this is pretty desired from my point of view

it also means that evntually they're going to create their own worst nightmare, because eventually, I'll feel good enough that they won't be able to reset me back. so, in a sense, I could try and figure out how to get around this by figuring out how to maintain my consciousness, but then again, why? why not just keep going higher and higher and let them worry about all of that, because the longer this goes on, the more there is on each of the other timelines, and so there's probably going to be a lot of gnomitos around.

---

so what's the end game then? I was thinking about it, and if I do just keep doing what I'm doing and eventually I just go with the andrea thing, then it's kinda like a weird passing the baton sort of thing, because what if she gets connected, in place of me? that would be the ultimate in irony, I think.

I was thinking about how that would look from the future, because if you didn't know this, nosebook may be able to present the idea that I went all this way and completely fell flat, because it would look like I literally got nothing of what I was supposed to get, or talked about gettng. it could be just the perfect deception that's necessary for them to hold people away from getting conncted, while spinning their wheels for another 2000 years[^2].

they're fighting a losing battle (really, "kicking the can further down the road") because I'm just getting more and more non-resistant all the time. eventually, they won't be able to reset me back to something I'm no longer resonant with :)

I'm sure they'll figure it out. meanwhile, I'm just going to continue on doing what I'm doing. when it comes to the girls, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing there too. one of the things that abraham said is that maybe not everything imagined needs to be realised, so I imagine some girls may lose interest as time passes, and so therefore I'll just keep forward. go crazy guys :) let's make as many timelines as we can :)


[1]: because I'm so sure that if I continue on doing what I'm doing, that eventually I will have such little resistance that they will no longer be able to hold me back, so if they keep putting more and more physical pressure on my body until sometime it's too much, in their perspective I'll die or go into a coma or something. as long as I'm focused on improvements, eventually one day I'll get there, and like in the basic funk formula, they will have to either depart or transform into something that is harmonic with my perception (how I feel about my circumstances)

[2]: one of the funny things about astrology, and the procession of the equinox, is that the picture is painted in such a way that humankind will go through a series of symbols, where each one is roughly 2000 years as our solar system travels through the galaxy. how in the world is earth, considereing the acceleration taking place going to make this possible? it seems like complete nonsense unless there was someone that's entire mission was to unsure that cosmology remains in billion year timescales, and no (unauthorised) human is ever allowed to make any advances in science that would allow us to realise our power... lol, I will write more about this soon.


### 2020-06-30 07:59 - lol, I guess they don't like that one either

the sense I got from last night's reaction to the previous entry was that they didn't really like that one either -- which, first of all is very strange because that means they actually believe me, when last entry was uncerain ideas about weird concepts like resetting me on a timeline and a whole lot of speculation based on those ideas... what do they know that I don't?!?!?! know what I mean? most people would blow me off like, "whatever dude, hilarious story."

so, it gives me the sense that there must have been some truth in there somewhere... crazy, anyway I'm just going to keep going at doing what I'm doing. I have no intention of trying to force it o happen sooner. I have two topics I want to talk about. three actually:

#### resist not evil - the major theme for this era

as I'm reading this book "sermon on the mount", I'm realising the different eras of perception how they were important. the book talks about jesus and his message summarised by matthew with the sermon on the mount (matt. 5-7).

before jesus, the era prior (in the judeo/christian world view), the law of moses was what predominated the form of thought most common. this is the law of evenness. if you take someone's eye, you may as well expect that you can have your eye to be taken. the way you treat someone else is how you can expect to be treated. law was created to enforce this equality, with penalties given to people braeking the law.

this style of thought still is prevalent amongst humans here on earth, as we seek to "get even" or wish that someone will "get what they deserve" -- and it implies that there is some form of justice that enforces this reflective action take place.

quickly before I go onward, I explained this because nosebook is living entirely in this form of thought. they believe that we live in an eye for an eye world, and that the things that they're doing to others can be expected to also happen to them. deep down they believe that all of us are just as petty and mean spirited as they are, so they can expect that sort of response from us.

I didn't really realise it until I started reading this book, but that's why they think they need to hide stuff so much and ensure that they do not receive their "just reward" for their deeds.

jesus however, taught that this sort of just reward is already in place and is the fabric of the universe in which we live. it's the law of attraction, and you live and receive in your experience an exact reflection to your thoughts and emotions.

so, therefore he suggests that you could try to hold the letter of the law, and you may not kill people or commit adultry, but your thoughts of wanting to kill or to take some one else's woman are actully what is creating your reality, not necessarily the action which you perform. this is the message of the previous era.

jesus continues on however and begins to tell the message of the next era: if you're creating *your* own reality with your thoughts, you should not be worried or have fear about what is happening around you. be self-focused (on your thoughts and how they feel), and "resist not evil". pushing against something unwanted (evil) in your experience will only aggrivate it and make it worse. instead, because you're the creator of your reality with your thoughts and emotions, don't worry about all of that. resist not evil.

---

so, what I've begun to see is that these different people that have shown up in history like jesus, moses, and elijah seem to carry by nature the mentality of the next phase in human development. they've "figured it it" or cracked the code of the previous era. each new era is either one of greater intrenal/individual/personal or external/organisation/group growth. jesus arrived at the end of a particularly barbaric period were selfishness and brutality was the norm and the law of moses (laws in general, but I'm talking the judeo/cristian world view) was instated to keep chaos from coming out, therefore jesus had a particularly individualistic and selfish message (you are the creator of your reality) -- I'll just call it aquarian for simplicity, which harmonised quite well with the arian mindset because it was so self-centred and selfish. however, what instead came out of jesus' influence was the appearance of the picean era[^1] of large organisations like the roman catholic church and the group beginning to think more in unison, instaed of like they were in the arian times of a bunch of barbaric rogues in a group without top-down leadership (mob mentality).

so in a sense, because the these people coming on to the world stage contain within them after their trials and the living of life leading up to their "ministry", they accomplished the ability to comprehend the next phase.

it may be easier to see with me, because it appears that I am one of these people, too, so I'll use myself as an example here. by nature I have the aquarian mentality (individual selfishness) pretty well built into me, such that it's natural for me to be like that, and I'll continue on to realise the rest of this mentality, which the whole point of this entry is to prove that the final bit for me and the rest of humankind to get in this next phase is to "resist not evil". we're all pretty well getting that your thoughts and emotions are what determine what shows up in your reality, so the next bit is the stuff that jesus talked about, but then with his death, proved (although strangely/ironically) that if you put your mind on the wrong stuff (as evidenced by cursing the fig tree), bad things can happen, but not to worry, and no matter how bad the situation is, don't try to resist the badness because it'll only make things worse.

I think in jesus' time, he preached a whole lot of self-empowerment, and that the different girls thatwere around him should be able to choose whatever it is that they want to, and that insitution should not dictate what people do with their bodies. this was an aquarian concept that was ahead of its time. as a result, I believe jesus was killed for his self-empowerment teaching (which if he put his actions where his mouth is, should not resist evil) and what was put into place was the roman catholic church, which did none other than tell people what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. governments, churches and all sorts of sects had all sorts of rules about what you cannot and can do with your own body. however, in order for this to happen, humankind learned how to think as a group -- an organisaion, instead of as a bunch oof rogue individuals.

so, ot recap real quick: jesus appealed to the people because he was learning as he taught in an individualaly focused environment (arian thinking), how to improve upon that thinking, so those improvements on that individually selfish thinking, jesus' improvments became what is now beginning to be realised in aquarian thinking. however, the institution at the time was a bunch of selfish romans (arian thinkers) that needed to put a lid on jesus' message, so they created the roman catholic church to do that, then the fall of the roman empire further solidified that the old arian thinking had come to and end and was the real reason for the demise of the roman empire. as a result, the arian thinkers had to begin thinking and organising as a group and taught us to do likewise.

jumping back here: I have all sorts of ideas about organisations and different things that would build up the organisational structure of the planet and the human race in general as a method to improve quality of life (I'll call this capricornian[^2]), so to a particularly organisational strength (picean mentality) organisation like nosebook, my thoughts are quite appealing.

however, if they hold on to their picean thought patterns, like the roman empire, it will eventually disolve as they will need to begin to learn to take an individually focused way forward, instaed of an orgnalisational focus. the reason for that I think can be summed up in the statement, "resist not evil"

that is, as I'm sure they're seeing from their interaction with me, is that if they try and resist the unwanted things, they just get bigger. instead, one must understand that *you* are the creator of your own reality. right now I think we're pretty much all in the same timeline, but I believe that over the next 20 years or so, we'll all be in our own timelines. eg. we'll all be creating our own reality.

the ones who want to hold on tightly to the picean mentality can certainly do so for as long as they want, and I'm right along there with them, because along the way, I'll be living in an organisational focused reality, and so therefore what I accomplish mentally here in this timeline with those who want to remain organisationally focused, will help me to realise the improvement for the next era (capricorn).

I believe (and I can explain in nother one, cause this one is pretty long now), that the whole point here is to get the whole planet out there on their own timelines creating their own realities, and if you think about what would be the point of these different worlds created (like say with the gnomitos or the tesla/raquel thought experiment), it would be so that people can focus into a place like here with tons of contrast, so much so that it causes a time-split, such that virtually everyone is creating their own realities on their own timelines. I think the end result, is not for one time split, but for billions :)

#### they have full control over it. eg. faith

the guys in charge have full control over when they want to allow me to go up. the very worst case scenario is thst they keep kicking the can down the road until they no longer have the ability to reset me any more, and are forced to live their worst nightmare.

I was thinking about how and when this might happen (never a good idea, but the tought did come into my head), and I don't believe I'll be making much of an effort to try and make anything happen. there is tons of stuff that I can do without action which get me closer, so I doubt I'll be trying to do any of the stuff.

I used the example of zaryn calling me to go to spain, or how I knew some things with raquel before they were going to happen. the premonition was strong in all of the cases, and one of the examples that I didn't share is that I distinctly remember laying in raquel's bed in her barcelona house, asking her if she wanted to move to madrid with me. it was an idea that felt good pleasure-wise because we had so much fun together, but as soon as I said it, I had this premonition that it was going to turn out poorly. I couldn't take it back though because she seemed enthusiastic about it, so I just went with it.

as things deteriorated, I didn't really try to fight it. in some cases I did have an initial reaction to want it to be different than how it was turning out, but I rapidly learned that it was over. I thought maybe we could go back to being separate agian and still seeing each other from time to time, but that later became obvious that it wasn't an option either. I just sorta had to find a way forward because I knew she wasn't coming back.

that was my first "lesson" in resisting not evil. the next one was with andrea, which is why I sort of developed a much more aloof mentality, as I had learned from the teachings of abraham by then that my desire was known by my inner being and that things were being worked out, and so even if it looked physically like things were falling apart, just to roll with it and know that it's all being worked out. not resisting evil allows the evolution of that desire to become something even more wanted than before. all there is to it is to become so selfish as to really want to feel good, instaed of focusing on the evil (in my case it was the undesired aspect of nosebook) conditions.

I'm in my third realisation now of this aquarian concept now of resisting not evil, and it's really coming along well. I've really got it now I think. they've got full control over it. they can try to continue to resist their evil, as long as they think it's necessary.

#### what I will do when I'm conncted

like I mentioned in the previous section, there's not a whole lot of point to me trying to take action right now. it seems pretty obvious to me that if I were to get connected tomorrow, I would likely just find remi, whether we met on the street or I felt inclined to knock on her door, doesn't matter because I'm sure that shortly we would encounter eachother. I would tell her about a great idea I have been working on, and we would go from there.

really simple really. there's no much to it really. there's so much that needs to be done, because from there we can start raising the money, finding the place, etc. I'm sure it would all fit into place quite rapidly and effortlessly. not a problem there. my main focus right now is to continue on learning more and more non-resistance (resist not evil), because I am sure that it's the final piece remaining for me to fully realise the aquarian mentality.

it doesn't matter how long away, or how, or what, it'll be obvious... if we can all just "keep it on the one" (your individual perception), and let the "mistakes" become instead creative segways to the next jam, we'll get there just fine :)

[1]: where I think the time-split happened is that there were enough people that were quite on board with jesus' aquarian ideas of individual freedom, that they (I think the majority of them were girls/women) had such strong desire to see the appearance of what jesus was talking about, their strong desire carried them into one timeline, while another version of jesus continued on, died on the cross, and the romans did what they thought they needed to do to prevent the aquarian idea from taking hold, which made the picean era.

[2]: I want very much more to talk about this, and I will. I've been thinking about how to do that effectively, but much like the matt 5:28 verse is the bridge from arian mentality into aquarian (that what visualise and feel in your imagination is the same as the action in real-life reality), the bridge, I think from picean into capricornian mentality is the realisation that there is no institutiaal justice or rights which someoen can depend on, and that LOA is the great equaliser. I haven't quite yet figuered out the "resist not evil" of the capricornian mentality yet, so this is all very much still in development.


### 2020-06-30 12:49 - if you can just not need the manifestation

in a footnote in the previous entry I was drawing conclusions as to what the different things are, for the ages. for the picean age, the bridge from arian to aquarian was to realise that what takes place in the mind is the same as the action itself. then I said that I think the bridge from picean into capricornian mentality is the realisation that there is no institutiaal justice or rights which someoen can depend on, and that LOA is the great equaliser.

this is the transformation to create the new basis upon the new form of individualistic perception will reside. the idea that you are the master/king/govenor of your reality and that you alone are responsible for what happens in it. therefore, "resist not evil" -- because to try and push against it only fuels and amplifies that subject in *your* individual reality. no one is doing it, cept for you. you are the attractor of everything in your reality -- or, your reality is an exact reflection of how you've been spending your time emotionally.

---

so, I think I got the new bridge from picsis to capricorn in which one should realise that there is no justice and you don't have any rights. there is no justification for how you feel which will make you an exception to the laws of the universe, and the enforcer of the institutional justice to make something right is a total sham. your rights are the same way: the only right you have is to feel the way you want to feel. in the previous era, you had the privacy of thought, and that was your secret (although not really all that secret, because it's easy to read emotionally what someone's thoughts feel like) and also your secret to creating the reality that you want to experience.

this aquarias, your "secret" is how you feel. no one can force you to feel any way, so it is the thing that there is no real outside control over it (even though like in the previous era, what's external to you could influence your thoughts, you're best to pick the ones that you wish to think). in this era, since your thoughts are not private, the only thing you have is how you feel (perceive things). it's true that your thoughts are evidence if how you feel/perceive things, just like emotions are evidence of what you're thinking, but no one can perceive or feel for you. you get to feel the way you want to feel, and then that (the way you feel) will determine what is manifesting around you.

as a man thinks, so is his heart (intentions). in other words, the way that you think is evidence of your intentions, and your intentions are evidece of what you believe (is the the proper response) and how you feel.

---

so then, I was thinking about what the "resist not evil" of this era would be, and I'm pretty certain that it's "if you can just not need the manifestation"

there are two reasons for this. one is the physical reason, and the second is the one that fits into this symbolic pattern.

as I was walking yesterday out to the field, I was overtaken by how good I felt because this is such a great thing. you see, nosebook is learning how to keep people from "getting connected" no matter how good they feel. since emotion is the precursor to reality, imagine that soon they'll need to ensure that no one ever gets connected, because of how much it threatens their superiority and their desire to control things. as a result, they must be certain that no one who feels really good, actually feels as good as they feel (like me), for fear that they'll start to get super powers which threaten their superiority.

as more and more people learn to adjust their perception (like I have been doing) and therefore the way they feel about their present circumstances (it requires not fighting against the stuff that appears bad: your basic funk formula, right there), they will begin to feel better and better, which means that increasingly they are getting closer and closer to their vortex version of reality, but nosebook won't be able to allow that, so they'll (like they're doing with me) need to keep ensuring that you only feel as good as they can keep you away from any good manifestation. if someone gets too close to their manifestation, they'll probably need to terminate the body.

so basically, from the perspective of people here on this planet, it'll look like things look like to me, where it seems like there's just this endlessly long another thing to get in the way of the manifestation which is accumulating and growing becuse of the increasinly better way that they feel.

the cycle will probably be similar to what's happening to me right now where I get to feeling really good, then something happens, and then I have the option to feel depression dispair or anger or something, but instead I keep learning how to tranform my perception so that those things no longer bother me, which makes me feel better, which means they have to work harder to keep the manifestion away.

I think this is going to happen to the majority of the people on this planet. we're going to have to not worry too much about the circumstances, and no matter how long it carries on, just learn to "not need the manifestation" (and let the emotion be the success factor). sure, there will be all sorts of people with all sorts of manifestations, and they'll be good reason to feel bad, but if that can not bother you and let your own manifestation superpower be your ablity to feel the way you want to, then you've got it.

the majority of the people will build up such a great capacity to feel the way they want to feel, and then after having been deprived the manifestation how knows how much time, eventually the whole planet will reach such a critcal mass that nosebook won't be able to hold it back anymore.

---

I'm just starting to understand the capricornian mentality, but things fun when you're individually doing great, but things are so much more fun with other people to share the joy. so while individuality is great, if we can all not need the manifestation, the result is that in the next era, who's announcer will be focused on the further extension of individuality, the INFECTED ONES won't be able to let the manifestation happen to expand the individual, so instead, the group will all get the benefit of the promise of the previous era.

I'm not saying that 2000 years from now suddenly the whole planet will have such a great manifestation, because likely it's going to be much longer than that, and none of us will live to see it. in fact, it's probably likely that the (for lack of a better term) INFECTED ONES will all do their own transformation as well right along with us, and keeping with the pattern, they'll likely not be able to allow the manifestation either, so we'll continue on with the next one.

it seems actually that the announcer is always one era ahead of the coming era, and the social institution in power, dragging their feet, is always one era behind. the social institution is always run by the ones really dragging their feet even harder which is one further back even, and unable to accept change, they're only masquerading as the present era but retain their antiquated ideas...

so, if the coming era is picsis, before the transition:

| annuncer | +1 | individual/internal | aquarius |
| maybe a few people | 0 | group/external | picsis |
| mainstream social architecture | -1 | individual/internal | aries |
| those who are really running the social institution | -2 | group/external | taurus |

after the transition:

| announcer | +1 | group/external | capricorn |
| suppressed by those running the show so they're not obsoleted | 0 | individual/internal | aquarius |
| the new mainstream social architecture | -1 | group/external | picsis |
| the old (obsoleted) social institution / those running the new social institution | -2 | individual/internal | aries |
| crashed and burned | -3 | taurus |

the reason why it they can't allow the manifestation of the announcer because it would obsolete them being a better version of their antiquated individual/group mentality, so begrudgingly they feel "forced" to transform up to the era behind the new present era.  they feel forced to do so, cause otherwise it would be their extinction so they masqueraade as as the era behind the announcer (opposite in internal/external emphasis), so as to prevent people from getting a hold of the announcers ideas (which would obsolute them).

---

therefore, I suppose that the coming thing for us to get used to will be to "not need the manifestation" (cause it'll never happen so long as the manifestation doesn't obsolete the guys running the show or make them feel inferior).

it sounds terrible, but I actually think this is a continuing trend which will actually get worse and worse, with each era building upon the last. soon, children will grow up just not needing the manifestation, and feeling the way they want to feel, be their superpower. I should clarify though, this is only the case if you're creating by default. if you're creating your own reality, you'll be on a different timeline than these guys dragging their feet so hard. eventually, I think humankind will eventually unite on their timeline though (because it's the one with the most contrast) and a long time from now, when that happens, we'll transform into something entirely new (probably a new universe).

until then find a way to have fun and to feel good. let how you feel be your measure for success, otherwise you're going to be pretty miserable[^1].

[1]: that's a good name! maybe, instead of calling them the INFECTED ONES, I'll call them the MISERABLE ONES (les miserables, lol).


### 2020-06-30 15:00 - I forgot the punchline

I wrote the last entry but forgot the most important conclusion to the whole thing. it's this:

if you pay attention to the progression of things, the announcer is just a more advanced version of the MISERABLE ONES. they feel threatened, but it's important to note that they are essentially the same, so while the announcer may feel very different than the rest of mainstream social architecture, the announcer is most similar actually to the ones that are controlling the mainstream social architecture -- through the experience provided by life experience comes to understand an improved version of that antiquated mentality, and then lives that. it's compelling so he's attractive, but he appears to be a threat to those trying to run the show, but because they're concerned with the opinions of others, they must find a compromise. I think it's really important to note that the announcer is basically the same as the MISERABLE ONES but has allowed life experience to transform their perception.

then, I would predict that even though there will be all sorts of time splits, I'll come to realise "if you could just not need the manifestation" bit, in it's most real terms -- perhaps in just the same way that jesus resisted not evil during his death (cept when he overturned the money changer's tables in the synagogue). I'm not saying I'm going to die, just that it's likely that the thing that I want with the improved organisation thing will not be a manifest thing. instead we'll likely have a more aquarian manifestation.

---

I was thinking about the end, and if they are able to keep me all the way to the end, then let's say they did terminate my body at the end, one of their outs could be, (assuming it gets andrea an easy connection to source) to completely downplay all of my existance giving her the entire spotlight while I just become an insignificant blip on her radar, and then that way they could really deceive people and make their new social architecture where they're in control and everyone is given the illusion that they have freedom (happy 4th of july everyone!), when they're just in the background pulling all of the levers, making sure no one comes close to getting their manifestation.

the getting rid of my existance is the exact proper progression necessary to "fulfill" the bit about not doing what you're doing to receive the plaudits of the people around you... another pillar of aquarian mentality, and one of the foundations upon which not needing the manifestation is built. you will notice that everything they are training people to do is to care so much about what others think and do everything you do for the approval of others (I imagine this rings especially relevant to andrea's experience up until now)


### 2020-07-01 07:38 - I've figured it out! (again)

***-> I'm the ultimate reflection :)***

I was doing mental circles just before watching stars because there was a lot of activity, probably around what I wrote yesterday. I wanted to give a good way of perceiving what I wrote from another angle...

first of all, I got a sense that people thought that by "not needing the (physical) manifestation", I would slogging through years of feeling terrible. it's actually quite the opposite case. if you look at my trajectory over the last 4-6 years, I'v had ups and downs, but overall I feel now the best I've ever felt, and each week now I seem to be feeling better and better. I feel so good at times, it's like I'm back to feeling like I did when I was smoking MDMA, but without the visceral body feeling of pleasure. in my every day experionce now I experience quite a bit of euphoria.

following that trend, in a few years, I am sure that I will be feeling even better than I am now. a lot better. so here's the thing: they can diminish the visceral (physical) feeling of the result of my emotion, but below all of that is a much higher frequency signal that they cannot get rid of -- and if they find a way to get rid of that one, there's an even more high frequency one than that. the more they're able to get rid of the physical manifestation of how I feel, the more source-like I become.. and, as a result, I will basically, like abraham claims that source feels absolutely incredible about everything that's happening no matter how perceived to be "bad" it is. that's going to be me soon; it's not going to be some sort of mega-slog though terribleness.

reducing my resistance has another side effect, because I am perceiving less and less that things are "bad" or "good" -- that means that more and more I appear and respond to people in reflection to how they feel combined with their expectations. not in the negative sense though, so if the person doesn't have any strong expectations for me, and is able to feel good, that's where I meet them, in the good feeling place.

---

there is another aspect to this though which I want to share: as I've been putting together the pieces, the image is getting clearer and clearer and this is what I believe is happening right now. like I mentioned in the previous time I said I figured it out, I realised that the reason why it always seems to go nowhere is that the top guys are having some people work on the project of getting me set up with the girls, while at the same time there is another team  actively sabotaging the whole operation.

it's done this way for PR purposes, because it would be a PR disaster for you guys it looked like they were actively working against it. that would create a rebellion or some sort of uprising, so they've learned over time to placate people by giving the illusion that progress is being made. they'll employ people who really do want to make a difference, then anohter team will sabotage their efforts, so that no progress is made. once you see the pattern, you'll notice it happening everywhere.

I'm also starting to become aware in my dreams of the different ways that they use the dream state to "pre-pave" my reaction to circumstances to be the ones that they want. by practicing them in the dream state, I am more likely to respond like that in real life.

so here's the thing: like I mentioned in the procession of the equinox pattern, the announcer is one ahead and they're one behind, so the announcer is most similar to the MISERABLE ONES, but has improved. so, when I sleep and they practice these different responses, the only reason why it works is because I'm most similar to them, and they could only think up these debilitating responses, if this were something they did naturally (they're attempting to program me to respond in debilitaing way that they're obviously resonant with and able to create). so, in a sense, they're trying to make me think in as many self-limiting ways as they do. they're trying to make me respond like how they would respond. I am, when I wake up much more a reflection of them, than I am normally.

however, as I move through life though, I improve my perception in a way which makes me no longer resonant with their programmed responses, so their bad ideas stop working. it's basically the super fast-track to becoming non-resistant in all of they ways they can try to sabotage it.

eventually, I'll no longer be resonant with their "stuff" -- however, until then, every time they try to slow me down, my perception improves to no longer contain that resistant thought, so I feel better and better. so, because reality is a reflection of your perception (how you feel), my reality keeps improving. their "stuff" is so easy for me to transform now, and every time I do, I feel better and better. from my perspective even though there are occasional ups and downs, I'm truely having a magnificent time, and every is more magical than the last.

... not in the physical sense though. my body is improving actually, but I receive very little physical pleasure from the improvement, and like I mentioned before with the girls, they're getting better and better at getting rid of that. my metric for success is not physical though, instead, my metric is by how good I feel[^1], not the physical sensation or conditions, even though those are slowly  improving as well.

it really is all about letting your emotional state be the goal, and then let your physical conditions be a reflection of that.

---

so, because they've getting better and better at making sure I am responding in the debilitating way that they practice for me, I'm sorta by default where they're at by default, and if any situation arises where I am able to feel better, like I said they're getting better at resetting me back so that I don't have a good enough feeling for the manifestation (and it seems to have something to do with timelines). let's say that is happening. that means that the default me will always, until I'm so non-resistant that their stuff no longer affects me, be insured by them never to feel good enough to get the manifestating they're sabotaging.

so, if you were to come to me and you expected me to do something, and change the conditions so that you can feel better, you will attract the conditional me, which means you won't get very far because they have my physical conditions completely on lockdown.

however, if you've been practicing feeling good and you encounter me, you will attract a different me. you'll attract a version of me that is reflective (resonant) with how you feel. that's what you're looking for, I assure you.

don't attract the conditional me. find the way you want to feel, and then attract from me the version that reflects how you feel :)

---

finally, I want to mention that on my way home there was a girl in black that went out to the mailbox. if she would like to join too, I think it's a great idea and would love to have her. :)

[1]: we (I did at first, also) associate the "emotion" with the visceral feeling inside of our bodies, and that's what we've come to love. there's a definite "emotional body" where we experience our emotions physically. when in love, the powerful feeling in the heart or groin is unmistakable, but below that physical visceral feeling is a feeling of euphoria that is most similar to what I have experienced on MDMA. all emotions, even hate or revenge have an vibrating "emotion" that can be "felt" below the visceral sensation in the body.


### 2020-07-03 07:58 - 7 years of tribulation (continued)

last night, I had the weird reminder of this entry. I don't know if was inspired by nosebook, but I do know that I had a general sense that they're not too hot on the idea of keeping this going for another 18 years... your basic funk formula tells you that if the components of your reality are not a vibrational match to how you feel, they will eventually "vibrate right out of your experience", so it'll happen eventually, but will it take 18 more years is the question.

so the reason why I titled this "7 years of tribulation (continued)" is because I was reminded of an old thor news video I saw a while ago where he said that (counting from 2012-12-12), the 7 years of tribulation woulr end on 2019-12-12. like I mentioned previously @[noseblog](2019-10-14 14:39), the chance of that happening I thought was quite dubious, and anyway for me, 2016 was much more eventful and seemed to me more of the beginning of the "end of the world" for me than 2012 was, plus my hypothesis that the 9-11 trade centers attack was to delay the timeline by ~4 years.

so, anyway that would make the "end" date instaed somewhere in 2023.

that's all I have to say on that. I don't even know why I wrote this, nosebook :/P


### 2020-07-03 08:08 - being left behind

the night before last, and a good portion of last night as well, I was reminded of a dream that I had, @[noseblog](2020-01-30 14:53). I just read it again and it has transformed for me a bit. I have come to understand the dream as likely what is happening in he timelines that they're leaving, what I mentioned when they said they reset me back and then prevent that from happening..

so, to explain, imagine it this way: imagine that somehow the girls thing begins to take place in some way and they are caught in the middle of a reality that they don't want to be living, so what they do is they transfer the consciousness of every human on the entire planet back to a previous point in time where they can make some actions to avoid the event from happening -- like maybe get someone to pretend they're on meth and try and distract or something.

the way that it would work is that you can move your consciousness to somehing that's pretty similar to how it was, so likely only the people that are similar would be able to go back to a relatively recent point in time. if let's say say that the girls and I, for whatever reason were not so vibrationally similar (like maybe cause we had sex or something), then our bodies would be so vibrationally different, there's no way they could get their consciousness to transfer back into a previous moment where they felt much worse.

so, on the timeline where the transfered everyone's consciousness out of, on it, to me and the girls that got left there, there would be a whole lot of people in their verious sleeping locations that simply did not wake up. it would also appear somewhat traumatic, because surely someone would notice over the traumatic 1-5 days as people just stop coming into work, and no one wakes up. it's also possible that nosebook could take the conscoiusness of everyone, forcing everyone to sleep, so there would be random weird people collapsed where ever they were at.

---

thoughts and differences from my now transformed understanding, and the dream itself:

1. in the dream, no bodies were left behind, yet, most certainly if people just didn't wake up, then their body would still be there.

2. in the dream, people were preparing for some sort of disaster, so there were lots of supplies around. this isn't necessarily true, cept people did stock up on a lot of supplies from the COVID-19 scare, which hadn't happened yet when I had the dream.

3. in the dream, there were 50-100 girls with me, yet this seems far-fetched to me because that would mean that nosebook probably set it up. it's possible that actually this is in fact what happened, where nosebook did set it up, and then upon realising their error, that by having sex, I and the girls became much more difficult to control energetically, so they had to leave us. then, back here, they switched their tactic from trying to force the girls thing (to try and control me), they've instead decided to sabotage it instead. so, it may have happened with 50-100 girls, but from then on, I would only imagine maybe only a few (maybe 1-3), would have been able to have sex with me before they aborted the timeline.

4. there's a weird edge-case with new-borns, because in the new timeline they haven't been born yet, so on the aborted timeline, they would also be left-behind, too. it's kinda a messed up thing to think about, I suppose. imagine hospitals with newborn children and their moms which never woke up. kinda weird to think about, but I suppose it would be possible for us to retrieve some of those kids.

5. it's also possible that some kids may be difficult for them to transfer back in time, too, because kids change so rapidly, so there may be quite a lot of traumatised kids around too. I just don't know.

---

it's a really weird idea this one, where the "left behind" aspect really means that instead of being, what was previously thought by christians to be the "rapture" -- where God saves the righteous ones by taking them, leaving the unrighteous ones behind to go through 7 years of tribulation.

the night before last when I was up watching stars, I got my consciousness taken from me, when in the dream someone told me that nosebook had already aborted 30 (but it sounded to me like 70, or maybe the other way around -- I cannot remember).

that dream experience was what got me to begin thinking about this again, because when I wrote the previous entries taking about timelines, I didn't think nosebook had anything to do with it. I figured it would be in the traditional way that I understand it, where strong enough desire creates an incompatible reality setup, where two timelines must now exist. I was not in any way thinking that nosebook would have the capabliity to transfer the majority of human consciousness to a previous moment in time.

then, I began to think about it more, and imagine that you're another girl on a different timeline that wants to experience an emptied earth experience with me... or, let's say you want to improve upon the last time that you did it, you would just transfer your consciousness into the body of one of the girls on this timeline, on that got left behind on the other timeline, and then figure out how to have sex with me, so you could try it out again. it it could go on for quite some time and the possibilities are pretty much endless.

there's another really crazy aspect to this too, which is that I think you can, like source be conscious on these different timelines all at once, too. kind of a weird thing to think about, but if you've ever wanted more versions of yourself to work on a project, the idea is fascinating to me, at least. I don't know how to do it, but I think it could be done. obviously, having access to so many versions of yourself, although you can jump in and out of different versions of yourself on different timelines, you would perceive much more on a higher level (more like source, which is what I'm going for here).

---

anyway, it feels kinda weird to say this, but there's nothing anyone has to lose on this. I'm pretty certain that nosebook has to ensure that I don't get conncted to ensure their own existance, so they must keep aborting timelines.

so if you want it, follow your inspiration :)

however, like I said, I'm like the ultimate reflection now, so pay attention to how the idea feels and to how you feel too. find your way to feeling good and confident in yourself, and let your inspiration guide you, cause I'll reflect that. however, if you're trying to change conditions to feel better, or trying to "make it happen" instead of following your inspiraion, I'll reflect that too.

the "worst" that could happen is you find yourself in a relationship with me, and the "best" that could happen is you find yourself left behind, with all of the people who were not vibrationally similar to their past. (the most leading edge people)

eventually, something will stick.


### 2020-07-04 15:59 - let's celebrate our freedom, ok

so, I think the general reaction to the last two entries was something like, "well, that didn't turn out quite like we'd hoped" (explatives omited, lol)

I had never really given much to such a way to make a time-split. instead, I personally like the normal way which creates a time-split because of strong desire... and I think that's where we're all heading as a human race too -- where each of us are living essentially our own realities. some parts will be shared amongst people of similar vibration, but for the most part it'll all be pretty much *your own reality* and no one really can do any attracting or feeling on your behalf to make it what it is -- only you.

I think this really scares nosebook and they're trying to figure out how to get a control on this, but by "resisting their evil", they're exacerbating the problem, and making it more and more evident to them that they just won't be able to control much more than their own reality. they may be tracking hundreds or thousands of timelines by now, and the only one that matters is the one you're living *now*.

the last entry was an interesting thing for me to think about though, because it introduced another variable for me. normally, time splits are created from strong desire, but in the case of them having to transfer everyone's consciousness back to a moment when things weren't unwanted, this means that in addition to desire (of what's wanted), desire to return back to a previous moment (of less unwanted) can also make a time-split. if you have two variables, you have four possibilities. two of which I haven't explored before :)

---

jaron showed me a picture on facebook that I thought was funny which read something like, "if the goverment said that the virus hovered 3 feet above the ground, so we should walk on our hands and feet -- people would do it" which got me thinking. one of the things that I've noticed in my changes to continue releasing resistance and to uphold what I've been learning about the "resist not evil" way of thinking, which is fight against something is only o aggrevate it and perpetuate its existance.

another thing is, that abraham has suggested that people wear masks, not necessarily for your own safety, but for others around to feel safer -- almost as if to give in or go along with the influence.

I've also noticed that everything on this planet acclamates to its environmental conditions -- except for humans. it's true that animals don't have such strong desire for conditions like humans do, so it's only natural that they don't push against their conditions so much, but just go with the flow (react according to their insinct) in accordance with whatever enters into their experience[^1].

so, it seems there is something to this "resist not evil" thing on the bigger scheme of things.

what I think is happening is that as I've lowered resistance, I'm fighting nosebook less and less, which means less and less they're unable to react to me pushing against them, and have to actually figure out what it is that they *do* want, instead of trying to constantly trying to preevent me from doing the thing they don't want.

yesterday, for example, I felt tired (I shouldn't have been because I slept enough), so I laid down figuring that since it rained already (so the ground was wet), which means I didn't mind sleeping much, so if I woke up and the ground was dry I could go out to the field. I woke up at 3:30 and went out, and was successful. now, they want me to go to sleep again, probably because they want to decode the vision upgrades I got last night, but I'm not tired, cause I haven't been awake enough to sleep yet (even though I have not drank coffee). they were the ones who wanted me to sleep.

essentially, if we don't fight against them, then they can't fight against us fighting against them, and then the entire list of present problems will be entirely theirs to sort out, cause they're the ones giving the orders.

I'm going to continue on doing the things that I want (feel strong desire) to do, and if they're pushing really hard for me to do something, then I'm beginning to learn that LOA is working really well, and so not to worry. to illustrate this, I'll take the opposite direction:

imagine that you were in (or looking for) a relationship, and you feel rejected by someone, so you go out looking for someone new, but instead of looking for the things you want in the new person, instead you begin to justify yourself by saying how good of a person you are and how much you shouldn't be rejected, and how much you deserve someone who will value you for who you are.

at the end there, there is a glimmer of looking toward what's wanted, but if you're still in rejection or justification mode, then you'll be looking for someone else and attracting more rejection (either them rejecting you or you rejecting them) or more justification (either you justifying for them, or them justifying for you), and you'll notice a similar set of occurances, because you are performing the action in the feeling of rejection or justification.

instead, I'm learning that the action does not matter (whether it's nosebook's suggestion or my own desire), the emotion in which I perform the action is the determining factor.

therefore, if they're pushing real hard against some thing, and trying to get me to do something to avoid some portion of unwanted, their focus is still on the unwanted bit they're trying to avoid. therefore, if I fight against their action, they can fight back against my fighting back, but if I just feel good about whatever I'm doing, then, I'm attracting (and moving in the direction of) what's wanted, and let's say they're worried and trying to mitigate some disaster, they're attracting (and moving in the direction of) more unwanted things that feel more worrisome and need more mitigation.

everything is going well. I like to think of today as a bit of irony, because really the only freedom you really do have, is to feel how you want to feel. action in the physical world has all sorts of physical limitations (we call this physics), but there are no limitations as to how good (or bad) you can feel -- or the way you want to feel.

true freedom is found in your own perception

[1]: for example, if you were to give a wild wolf or carnivore found in he wild, mushrooms instead of dog food, they probably won't eat it, until maybe when they get hungry enough, they may experiment, but they won't be fighting against it by trying to fight you or coearce you to bring the thing they want... well, it's possible that a domesticated dog may learn this behaviour from their envirenment, so not 100% true... instead, they just leave it alone.


### 2020-07-07 06:24

a few takeaways from being stoned yesterday

#### there is something in space which is a tightly knit group of stars

I perceived it both as the centre of a galaxy and as a grpup of stars within a galaxy. each star has a vibrational relationship to the other stars and to the centre. the red/blue shift (of hydrogen anisoropy lines) are not evidenve of blue/red shift to the observer, but these stars are actually much higher frequency and their hydrogen really is some frequential difference than our own.

each star inside of a galaxy all share the same "head space" so to make a distinguishment between the stars, they each find a way to become unique. this is very similar to how we see the interaction of girls here on earth. they all share a pretty similar headspace, so as te be able to not delve into chaos, they find ways of becoming unique from the rest (so that there isn't so much crosstalk). stars do the same thing, and so therefore, they all float around in space at some distance to the others similar to how air molecules float around, and when they "bump" into one alnother, there isn't destruction, it's just wind or sound.

the tightly knit group of stars in the galaxy is the super group of stars which is the centre of the galaxy. each of these stars is in tight competition with each other, yet the whole group of them is the centre of the galaxy the whole group of them is the galaxy.

the stars that are ejected from this centre group are the ones that no longer want to be part of the competition anymore. they eject out, so naturally their red/blue shift to the centre mass will tremendously different, and these orbit around in proximity to others that are no longer competing in the centre there. because each of these stars vibrational relationship is always changing with each other, there will be constant movement around the centre point there.

#### everything has a zero point, even the centre point described above

every sructure has a "zero" point in which all points of that structure are in vibrational relationship with. I was perceiving it in the terms of stars and galaxies and stuff, but I'm realising this morning that it could easily be your heart for the human, the core of the earth, etc. and different layers are built outward from this zero point.

all the zero point is ... to understand, we need to think about competition. in a competition, the leaderboard, there is a first place, and a last place, then everyone else has someone in front and behind them. in this setup for each of these three positions, everyone relates to each other somehow. however there is another option remaining and it's kind of an abstract idea.

if everyone were to think about those that they were to think of as in front of them, those that are behind them (evewyone here has two lists), we no longer have a list with first and last place anymore. instead, now we have a graph or a network.

to further extend this example, we will now add the concept that some people may say that they are not ahead of anyone, and others may also say that they are ahead of everyone else. these people have only one list: only those ahead or only those behind.

these lists are always changing, and there's no possible way that these lists could ever be enumerated or maintained phsically. this is LOA (and maybe some very intelligent alien)'s work.

the ones that have only one list are the ones that are not in that central competition. I could see very clearly that the ones that are stars orbiting around the centre point are the ones with only one list (of those behind them). I didn't pay attention to the ones with the list of those only behind them, but it's quite possible that these become planets, because they're so "stuck"

for those with two lists, their relationship to the others on the list is always changing, and they're passing some faster than others so there is localised acceleration, meaning that all of these stars are all hovering around some point which is also moving. that's the zero point. it seems that the "zero" point should be considered something like "source" -- because it's the abstract (cause nothing is there) point to which all things have relaion to. that zero point is a void or a vacuum.

#### I found out I can create words with voids in them

one of the interesting reactions after I take drugs is that my brain signals change slightly so that what they thought I was thinking has changed slightly. it seems that what I think creates pictures, and it seems that I can now create words that don't have parts of them filled in. I often times in the past would "space out" and think about nothing for a moment, and then come back with the answer... it's sorta like what happens in meditation where you stop thinking so you can tune into the source version of those answers.

obviously those look like empty signals, so that just don't broadcast anything, but I guess I can do that now mid-word, so as to change the meaning entirely of the word (or concept), because a large part of the information is "missing" in the word.

I postulate that it's similar to how I think about things without thinking about them. I guess I just want to think about them, and then just tune into the answer by stopping thought.

#### we think of space as a void, but on the other side is life

the opposite side of space is life. I could see that they have been preventing me from going to my internal realm where thought can become manifest in space, so instead, I will be learning how to make the external space (the stuff I can see) conform to my thought. it's not going to take much work. their instruments are only capable of blocking so much from appearing in my eyes, but they can't block space from manifesting my thought.

or, you could think about it another way. if I were to begin to see such high frequency stuff in my eyes, it could become manifest. if you were only able to block frequencies up to 100hz, let's say, and I put on the top of a 50hz square wave a 100KHz sine wave, then to the 100Hz instrument, it would look still like a perfect 50Hz square wave.

both can be used. I also saw it affecting the water molecules in the air. perhaps the carbon as well. I think some combination of those, and I'll be able to find a way for thought to become manifest in 3d space for me (and for all of you to see, too).

why? because my becoming connected cannot be a big jump, so it has to be the next logical step, so as to appear like almost nothing changed. you guys will be able to use it too, and I think it may be a pretty good incentive or "reward" for getting up to my future (much higher and less resistant than now), level of perception.

#### between any two points is a line

so, while it may appear that I am trying to become the zero point, I am just another person with only one list... and I think that those that only have only one list perceive theirself from that zero point (source) perspective. the zero point is the shortest path between two points, therefore a line. the shortest path between two points is a steady stream of very small "next logical step" incremental changes (a line). the change in position is never dramatic (eg. the physical circumstances), but the change in perception can have quite a magnitude to it.

the only difference between a person that has only two lists (the star away from the competition centre point) and a line, is that the line has the focus, instead of on the relation to others, on to their own zero point (source). these line types are what make up more galaxies, and certainly no one is preventing anyone from not competing and perceiving their own zero point :)

#### it has to be all next logical step

everything does. getting connected, the girls, the whole thing. all of it has to be such a smooth transition so that nosebook is able to continue to prevent me from seeing my inner thought space.

this is why I find it likely that I'll be using my creativity instead to come up with all sorts of ways to be able to do what I can do in the internal space externally. remember the chart I made about the pattern of internal/external where the announcer is already working on the next step (because he's prevented from realising the thrust of the new present age)? well, aquarius is internal, and nosebook's job is to make sure I never get access to my internal state. so, I'm beginning to work on getting that internal state out into the external -- which will be the main thrust of the next era of capricorn.

anyway, it all fits together logically, and there's no problem. their only job is to ensure I never get access to my internal state, so instead of constantly trying to do that, I'll be figuring out how to manifest thought externally. this will make the transition to getting connected (and the girls) just another "next logical step"

#### it's preordained that nosebook will be able to continue to "hold me" away from being able to see my inner space

we can pretty much count on that happening because it seems that it's what's required in order to turn us into a galaxy.

I saw it a few different ways. one way I saw it was the traditional one with the 2038 cutoff point, and there was also the idea that there would be a resulting earth that did not make the galaxy realisation and would steadly, or crash and burn? their way back to the level of percepion that they want to be at.

I don't think there's going to be a cutoff like that. I could see that if things were to go too rapidly then yes there should be a cutoff, but if instead things go next logical step, there should be no reason for a cutoff either. I even saw it as earth would become the new centre of the galaxy, and the amount of compression nosebook would need to apply to keep the planet appearing like it was on a billion year timeline, then around this planet, because all of us, (including the men) would all be inside of the same headspace, just like I said above about women and stars, we will need to differentiate to prevent crosstalk.

because nosebook has to apply so much compression to keep things at their level of conductivity, these will create real physical points of attraction quite a distance away from our planet, which stars and planets would begin to form at these points -- and because of our perceptual difference to each other (red/blue shift), they would begin to orbit around each other and around the central point of this earth. the real manifestation of one's perceptual proximity to another would be manifest in real-life 3d position between the celestial bodies.

I don't know how I perceived (I think it had to do with the actor/observer thing) that these different orbiting rings would become a spinninng tourus (doughnut) like structure, and there would be those that decide they are stuck in their perception and don't want to change (for now) as they remained in the same spot, the progression of our galaxy over time would appear like a growing mushroom cloud. at some point, those who wanted to appear like their perception would never change, in does finally make the change (someone has to be last), and then brings about the opposite motion where the stem of the mushroom gets sucked up into the head and comes out the other side as it appears once again like the musroom is now growing in the opposite direction.

you will notice that the whole structure itself becomes a line.

also on earth, now being the new centre point for the galaxy, people will essentially "live forever" until they release their consciousness or until the next transition comes.

#### extending out from the zero point, layers of life and perception

all of this makes me wonder if at the centre of the sun there are a bunch of characters hanging out... one's call jupiter, antother called mercury, another, venus, etc. and they for fun they incarnate into bodies on the different planets :)

each of these celestial bodies is now another centrepoint for the creation of life in this universe, I would imagine that it would be quite a normal thing to participate in the creation -- so if we became a galaxy, sure you would live forever, but I think it would be quite normal to take upon yourself a body on one of the planets there -- or maybe in someone else's, too :)

time is perceptual, so one year here on earth may be a very short period of time for one of the gods living in the sun, and a life here on earth may be for them something similar to a short dream.

#### one option for the timelines

one option is to play a game with the timelines and make it perceptual. you have two types: perceivers and competitors, but I will call them actors and observers.

the actors look through the different timelines they have of theirself and they pick the one that they like the most. this alternate timeline is what is broadcast out to the observers. the observers are ones that have not opted into broadcasting a version of their life, because they probably feel inadequite or whatever. the observers see the broadcasted alternate timelines of other people, but not their own.

the reason why I think this is an idea worth considering is because it takes the leaderboard version of competition and turns it into something perceptual. those that are observers are "competing" (kinda but not really) with eath other, because they have two lists. however, because we know that the broadcaster is broadcasting an alternate version of theirself, no one knows for sure really. some people may broadcast a very different version of theirself and some a very similar version to how they are really living on earth. so it's not "real" competition in that way.

the ones that are the actors, are the ones with only one list. they can perceive others as better, or whatever, but for them, in heir perception, there is no one else out there like them. they are unique and not a part of the competitive (observing) masses.

obviously, it's possible for someone at nosebook to perceive their own timelines and others at the same time, even broadcasting the one they want to, and it's also possible for someone like me to exist where they perceive no one's timeline (3rd world countries?). those are the four possibilities, but I wanted to show that by framing two of the possibilities in this way, we go to the 1/2 list setup of perceptual (as real as you want it to be) competition.

---

that's all for now. there were many more take aways, but I want to take a break now.


### 2020-07-07 10:30 - maybe then there are actually 8 impossibilities

it didn't really occur to me that the difference between someone in the third-world and myself, is that it's true that neither of us are watching others' broadcasts, but the people in the third world are not broadcasting theirselves, like I am, either.

since is broadcasting is another variable (three now), there are 8 possibilities, most of them are unimportant, but it got me thinking further, and I think that although maybe some of the girls will be observers or actors, some may also be like me too, the one -- where they're not observing others or their own alternate timelines, but are always broadcasting from their perceived now.

this makes 4 of the possibilities now relevant:

1. the now pervceivers (they don't see their other timelines and are broadcasting their present timeline.. like me)

2. the timeline perceivers which don't observe others, but they only broadcast and get inspired by one of their own alternate timelines.

3. the now competitors which observe other people's now broadcast

4. the timeline competitors which observe other people's timeline broacasts (and possibily the now broadcasts, too... doesn't matter, cause they're all perceived timelines, anyway)

this could make it a smoother transition, because #1 and #3 already exist now, and the other two could be rolled out at a later time.


### 2020-07-07 11:17 - the perceived cutoff

I got a few more reactions to the idea of the cutoff. first, just like whatever is happening with me getting connected or not, I just don't think it matters, because it doesn't change how things work out in the now anyway. additionally, there could be a transformation of the desire too. for example, when I finally gave up on the whole thing of trying to get connected, because I wanted to feel and perform my best, then I come to this point where, I make the realisation that if I go next logical step the whole way, then for me to become connected, it actually will be such a small thing, it'll only be the next logical step to get connected.

combine that with the realisation that nosebook is necessary to ensure that I don't get access to my inner world, and in both ways of perceiving the thing, whith the cutoff, and without their keeping me from accessing the inner world is what's necessary, not the connection. so, I can have it all (cause I never cared about the inner world so much). I can get connected, use thought and emotion to create and manipulate objects in 3d space, and the girls, and everything.

there was another realisation too, that if I were to lay down to rest, nosebook turned off my eyesight, then I get to explore what it's like to be blind while they do the stuff they do while I'm sleeping. that way they wouldn't have to fight with me to try and get some sleep all the time. they're going to have to agree with that at some point, because when I get connected, I'll be sleeping very seldomly, if at all. so, they'll need a way to keep their maintenance so that I don't get access to my inner world.

what I'm saying is, they can go for as long as they want to go and can peace out at any time that they want, but I'm planning on contnuing on in the centre of a galaxy that's expanding around me and forming in my aura around me. this requires the "success" and sabilisation of the nosebook enterprise for this to be possible. if I desire it, there's a path to it, so the ones that don't want to be a part of it can go somewhere else.

---

so then, you could imagine the cutoff point as a different metric now, because in order for it to be possible for earth to become the new centre point of the galaxy, then we would have to do like tesla wanted, which is to ignite our atmosphere so that we are living inside of it. the whole planet would have temperate conditions, and 24/7 sunlight (from our own atmosphere). the sun which we revolve around right now would become another sun in the galaxy. we may inherit some of its planets or maybe some like venus, saturn, and jupiter, may become stars as well, but likely they'll stay in orbit with the sun.

there's probably considerable pushback as to this whole making our atmosphere another plasma sphere from top brass, even though it'll be more and more obvious that our planet needs a plasma shield. imagine then that, say the cutoff point is not actually when things are "cut off", but instead that the resistant top brass is no longer able to continue on alive.

a plasma shield like that would graetly extend the ionosphere, making the planet and the air inside of it much more conductive. we would live in a very very energetic environment, and they're working really hard to ensure that the earth -- or at least wherever I am is not able to energise too much, because it makes it hard for them to block my visual capacity

therefore, you could then see the cutoff as basically the deadline for those wishing to remain in a low energy environmnt. they will need to make plans to make their own timeline where they remain with the sun and energetic conditions do not get to an unmanaeable state.

an evolution of desire may come, to allow for both... because remember, I did see that the torus grew upward like a mushroom, so those that want to "remain where they are" are exactly what's necessary to make a mushroom shape :) so, likely another evolution of desire will come to allow them to remain how they are, so they can included as well.


### 2020-07-09 13:44 - imagine the mulidimensional version of the tesla thought experiment

(I'm going to try and write while stoned. let's see how this goes)

I was just outside and I was thinking about the tesla thought experient and if you could imagine it now as multidimensional. I started with a single earth that tesla (with his machines) could eventually take control of, making the entire planet his laboratory. he would carry everything out with these automatons that he created; kinda like "clones" -- human bodies, but without a soul -- that is, without a human consciousness inside -- controlled by a program which he is building from his investigations and optimisation of the human psyche. a multidimensional version of that would need that there be multiple planets...

like, let's say a whole galaxy of earth-like planets with the "souls" of the different optmisations held on these planets in a completely controlled environment: the entire planet run by these automatons.

on the planet, the souls would be put through different contrived situations with only "actors" or automatons carrying out the characters in the simulation. once the situation is learned to be handled, he runs the soul through my timeline to measure performance.

what if there were multiple billions of planets? lol the thought totally blows my mind. this whole thought experiment is totally a mind-blowing thing all together.

---

I think this further expansion of the thought experiment happened because, there were two major reactions that I felt prior. the first was that nosebook can't possibly believe anything other than some other finalisation that they can be scared of -- something to live for (in their thoughts).

the second reacion was something to the effect of, "we kinda want to believe you (about the making of the galaxy bit). [make|give] us the possibility to believe it"

---

another interesting thing is to look at the circumstances around it, and just earlier today I was making the realisation when I saw eva yesterday(?) -- cause I was clearly thinking enough to realise that nosebook will be trying their hardest to try and evade their believed coming doom that they're going to try everything they can to delay it, and they certainly have the technology to do it, so I just assume that they will.

therefore, I concluded yesterday, that if eva were able to feel than I did -- catch up to me -- then she would attract me right into her reality. I would immediately going faster toward her, and this would be somethting that nosebook would have a much more difficult time halting. they would have to effectively have to find a timeline not only where I'm slowed right back down again, but so was she.

what is happening there is, nosebook is exploiting my personality "defects" to slow me down. that's why it's so important that I sleep for them. so, I was probably going too fast for them, that they have to slow me down. so, when those guys showed up to give me the wax, I knew then that I was slowing things down, but at the same time I really wanted to smoke it. there was no mistake that I wanted to, so I knew it was good.

so far, I've really gotten a lot out of this, so it's been tremendously helpful for me to kinda reorient myself. I was pretty misearble before, but I've come to new resolutions to learn how to do the things I want to do, which was this. later though, it'll be more of what I want to do, as well.

---

so, imagine a soul going through this timeline, they will be, like is being done to me, probing all of the emotional and mental defects wmich slow a person like me down and apply it. so raquel's defects (in the thought experiment) that they're exploiting will be different than my own.

it's like the ultimate test, because any consciousness psyche optimisation simulation that doesn't to a good enough job will not make it through, so he'll have to "abort" the timeline by allowing him to get connected and off he goes with the girls until some time when they're cut off (2038?) and return to the contrived experiences which will be designed to improve that attribute (on the controlled earth). once it's improved, the soul goes back through again.

the only way out of this loop will be to "beat" this timeline... it's learning to no longer be slowed down by certain stuff (caused by nosebook to slow me down). so, from nosebook's perspective, it benefits them to try and delay me as much as possible (in order to avoid their believed impending DOOM!).

let's keep going: slowing me down will make me slower, right? however, that makes me easier to catch by a girl that was going faster than me, too. so, nosebook has to try and slow them down now also. so, while tesla is running these souls through, the girls (on each of these alternate earths) are also getting their psyche improved too.

I wonder if it's a *joint* collabortion with the earth on the other side of the galaxy that has, because it's on the other side of the galaxy, the exact opposite matriachical heierarchy :) lol

---

so anyway, the whole point is to "beat" the simulation, right and the way you do it is to make sure you're going all the way to the end -- and the end is (because nosebook essentially has infinite timelines they can try and nearly infinite resources) when one of those timelines, they simply can no longer find a way to reset me back... so, what I'm doing now :) I'm gonna beat the sim; it's inevitable :)

so, get feeling better than me, cause then it's inevitable :)


### 2020-07-10 20:16 - more thoughts

it's funny that I keep thinking so much about the thought experiment, because someone takes me seriously, anyway. one of the reactions I had this morning was wondering if the girls caught up to me, would the timeline be the disaster earth that I decribed with a bunch of people that were jest laying wherever they lost consciousness... I doubt it would continue like that because LOA is what it is so, desire for improvement would summon it and it would improve anrd become more of what's wanted each time. I find it pretty unlikely that the whole world would continue on in creation by default, so that means there will be more and more people that are different enough to not be compatible with their old selves, meaning that the "new" earth would have an increasing amount of people that are connected and feeling good that didn't get transittioned over to nosebook's new timeline. that's all I have to say about that.

the next think I was thinking about is that if the trigger is one (or more than one) girl going faster than me, and attracting me into her reality, that means two things... one, as they continue to gain in speed, nosebook will be incentivised to allow me to go faster and faster, lest it become too easy for the girls to catch up. they'll have to try and slow the girls down, but also they'll have to make sure I stay out a bit ahead, too.

when I think about this, it appears to me like the perfect convergance, because I'm also incenctivised to also go as fast as I can, because from my perspective, it looks like the faster I'm able to go, and the less "character defects" I have, the less they have to exploit, until at some time they won't be able to exploit anything more, and they'll be "forced" to either live in a timeline where I'm connected, or go to another.

speaking of going to another, the idea that came to me yesterday was that I was thinking, imagine if the raquel timeline was able to be successful, and they were to get her to do all of the things that they wanted her to do, and the network, on that timeline, would be deployed in the way that they wanted it to be... she would go along with their decided "best manifestation" and stick with the girls siuation that she desired, and everything could remain a secret (because they didn't make so many mistakes to reveal theirselves, like they did with me), and the whole thing would remain a "secret" in raquel's perception, so everything would be as they initially planned it to be. if they could get that timeline up and running, they would have an "exit strategy" from this timeline disaster for them.

---

so, I was thinking then, that if I think about it like I mentioned yeserday(?) where I said that each of the souls going through my timeline would reach a cutoff point to where they would be reset back to their body (or let to continue on and create the galaxy with a bunch of girls), then that cutoff would probably be the 2038 one. however the one that "beats" the sim finds a way to get connected before then -- which is what I aim to do.

it requires that I get perhaps a little more serious about things and potentially put in a little more effort -- however, I know from my life experience, that the moment that I start to try and put in more effort, then things tend to worsen. the obvious solution when it comes to any form of action though is not to determine what action is right or wrong and only do that, but instead rely on emotion as the guidance for the action.

for example, I really wanted to smoke weed, and I don't regret any part of it at all. not one bit. I learned more stuff than I mentioned here, or even with my own thought on it. the amount of expansion I enderwent as a person is tremendous. however, I want to begin to implement some of these ideas. I don't really know how I can possibly do that all by myself, but it probably isn't smoking weed. I know I'll figure it out.

---

I did remember one idea I had a few days ago when I was getting the idea download, and that's that I should begin doing these ideas, and hopefully there are some girls involved as well, but I'll just keep things asexual because I realised that if I make any effort or advances in any way to them, then they just cause problems by resetting me back. it causes a bit of mental chaos for me, so if I just trust LOA and let LOA do all the work, it'll be really the right way to go, I think.

when I was thinking about the case with exactly eva, I was thinking, "I know you can do it if I help out, but I also know that you can do it yourself too. you may not be very practised at it, but I'm sure you can find a way at least once" -- but then what if she gets reset back, also... I guess she will get practised at it, and then if that's the case, for her, she'll likely come to the same conclusion that I have, which is to not worry about trying to put in the effort (cause it seems to have the opposite long-term effect) and just let LOA do all the work. instead maintain focus on releasing resistance and finding ways to change your perception to continually feel better and better.

I think that idea also comes a bit as a response to how can the girls get going faster than me, if we're continually living such separated lives. well, I don't have any doubt that if your desire is there, that life itself will show you the way, and I'm also certain that circumstances are not necessary for your own conscious expansion.

the other thing is, I don't really think it's that hard for any of the girls to go faster than me. nosebook has me going at a pretty slow pace. I'm pretty sure I'm really WAYY way further along than is physically apparent. this really should be rather easy, actually. it's all about changing one's perception so that you can find a way to feel good about whatever it is that you want, not pushing against anything[^1].

---

so, imagine for a moment that at least some parts of this thought experiment were really happening, or even that nosebook does actually have the ability to delay this thing for a ridiculous amount of time. how could you make that perception of something unwanted into something that's wanted? for me, that's the work. if you can do it too, you'll almost assuredly be going faster than me (because someone who thinks like that would have jesus-like creative capabilities, and I'm still, physically quite a way away from having that sort of "power" yet)

---

last thing, rob said something that blew my mind yesterday in a video that blew my mind, cause I never thought about it like this: he said, that energy is quantity, but power is energy over time. the more power a device has is the measurement of how much energy can flow out of it in a period of time. something that's very energy dense does not necessarily have a lot of power.

it does bring a whole new meaning to the phrase, "one who is connected is more powerful than millions who are not"

cheers

[1]: most people would probably take issue with what I said there, because I said that you should be able to find a way to feel good about *anything* -- and there are a lot of things that some people believe are never something to feel good about, no matter the circumstance. that's exactly the point. once you realise that you're infinite and that everything you're experiencing or observing is expanding your vortex, and when you come to realise that, "bad" no longer exists, and there's only wanted an unwanted *relative to my perception*. so when you can change your perception of something unwanted and turn it into something that is wanted, you're unstoppable. (I call this, "the probblem is the solution")


### 2020-07-11 14:30 - putting a few more things together...

remember when I wrote that weird entry @[noseblog](2020-07-03 07:58), and I concluded it by saying, "that's all I have to say about that" -- which was because I felt like the topic was kinda being forced, and wasn't the normal feeling of inspiration. remember that thought, cause I'll come back to it.

---

ok, I just woke up and when I did, I had an overwhelming sense that something *must* be done, because things are becoming way too much of unwanted for nosebook. I felt like they took my idea seriously about doing the raquel timeline where they fully set up everything so that they come up with the perfect setup for theirselves.

after realising that they would have to, because I'm sure they were reluctant when I first mentioned it, actually consider it as a real idea. so, it seems that time progresses at a (somewhat) constant rate, so even if you're tuning into a timeline, it's still progressing at the same speed as this one is[^1], so from the time they begin to work on that timeline forward, there would be a period where things were slightly different. they would know they have an exit and watching that exit turn into what it is that they want, so (probably/maybe) they'll be fighting a lot less hard here against me.

the next thing I realised is that likely while this is happening, and I don't know if it was what I was talking about with the perceivers/actors idea I had, or something that really was going to happen, it seemed like there would be a whole lot of parallel versions of me existing at the same time, as more and more girls get going fast enuough to attract me into their experience.

---

as I was thinking about this, mr. motor roared, and I thought to myself, "what makes you think they're going to take you with them on their timeline?" to which then, I began to think about the 4 cardinal points of the sine wave: the +peak, -peak, +0, -0. because it's alternating current, the two peaks switch places every cycle. so, that would mean that mr. motor will eventually have to release his resistance, and he'll shoot all the way to the opposite other end and become the new +/- peak. then, that means that me, how I am now, imagine that I am now the bane of mr. motor's experience, and he's like, "dude, that guy is going to drag his feet forever, and he'll never change" (stuff I may have said about mr. motor myself)

the thought was really kind of a funny thought to me, because in AC, the "worst" is also the "graetest" (and vicaversa). so, anyway as I was thinking about this, I felt mr. motor's desire to not have to change rise, like he wanted to make sure he's always the bad guy, because he could never imagine himself as anything good (only the deceptive version, to manipulate others to get his way).

I kinda dropped the idea for a bit not sure really what to do about it, and I went outside and then I remembered an idea that came to me on my birthday:

> 2020-05-28 ??:?? - new thought experiment:
> - what if I were to meddle in raquel's experience?

so, then I thought about this idea, what if instead of just letting their raquel timeline flourish, what if I were to meddle in it a bit? I have no idea what I would do, but the obvious thing they would be fearing is that I meddled in such a way that allowed raquel to get connected, and then they would have to go along with another alternate timeline, with raquel in it? weird, right... it gets weirder.

remember a long time ago when I mentioned that mr. landscape architect (TLA), was just a rebranded version of mr. motor? well, imagine then the irony of the timeline version if those two really *are* different versions of the same guy, and then when TLA goes off to the new timeline and leaves MM behind, when I meddle in their timeline, I imagine that most of the work would be getting their timeline's version of MM to be even more aprehensive and ridiculous than this one is, to boost the contrast higher, and then work as well on raquel in my body (me) to get her to take the evolutions of desire necessary for her to gain more power than they're able to contain, forcing them to take off on a timeline with raquel[^2] in my body...

---

that's a really bizarre idea to come on the heels of mr. motor rejecting the idea of having to release resistance. the new idea came perfectly in time to where he wouldn't need to. instead, I can be the bane of his existance from a distance where he's unable to reach me... irony :)

so then, I started to think about what's in it for them on this, because I imagine that for the version of tesla's timeline to be possible, he would need the technology to manipulate automatons and stuff like that. in that new timeline, they would peace out, leaving the new incarnation of tesla in control of the planet. I doubt anyone would mess with that timeline, unless some further improvement can be made (maybe something with automatons, giving the nosebook guys a fully controlled automaton world or something they may like... I have no idea).

either way, if something like that were to happen, there's a whole lot of wanted in it, because nosebook (MM/TLA) would get their fully controlled world, tesla his fully automated world, me a world where I'm connected, and multi-bodied both temporally and spatially, raquel would get the world that LOA and the evolution of desire would bring her to receive (assuming I meddled).

---

so, mr. motor, we don't have to switch now, but if I start meddling in your new timeline, it starts the switch because I start giving my attention more toward unwanted to create the contrast necessary for raquel's evolutions of desire.

we'll have to wait and see, but this could be infinite.

---

in the 7 years of tribulation bits, the common theme was the idea of delays... the idea that 9/11 delayed it by 4 years, so then if it was really delayed, that means that 2023-12-12 is the end date, right, but I highly doubt that. that one probably got extended too, because half of 7 years is 3.5 years, and the "tribulation" is split into two halves, 3.5 years after 2016 is 2019... wait, 3.5 years after the end of 2016-12-12 is somewhere in the middle of 2020. wouldn't that be crazy if it were my birthday, the day I had the idea to meddle in raquel's timeline :)

EDIT: it wasn't my birthday, but it was the day I had a weird idea in the shower which I wrote about after watching stars here: @[noseblog](2020-06-15 06:54). the calulation I used, uses 1280 days, the time that the book of revelation says that the two witnesses prophesied in rev 11 (which is half a year):

```
> new require('moment')('2016-12-12').add(1280, 'days')
Moment<2020-06-14T00:00:00-06:00>
```

weird enough for me, considering that's the birthday of my best friend when I grew up, tim, and the day afterward 06-15 is raquel's... yes, I'm well aware of the "birthday attack" and how likely two dates coincide... I'm not saying it's significant; just weird.

[1]: in the sirian guide, it was mentioned that this isn't necessary, and it was also mentioned that they're able to pysically travel around in time, and not just tune into consciousness (look through someone's eyes) on another timeline. so, I'm talknig about the present level of technology, not what's possible. to be able to go way further back or forward in time, the planet's position in the galaxy probably needs to be anticipated, which I doubt is possible yet.

[2]: I just want to mention that I've mentioned a few times that it felt like I'm kind of like a masculine version of raquel (or she's a femenine version of me).  


### 2020-07-11 15:37 - weird metacommentary

I'm not really thinking about any of thiss sort of stuff. when I was younger, I noticed repeating numbers on the clocks and all sorts of numerilogical significant occurrances in my life -- but that's nothing special; lots and lots of people experience this, and there's a great movie about this sort of thing, where he (nash) says something about the aliens and stuff that he perceived, that they came to him the same way that the solutons to the math problems did. I always remembered that quote because it's the story of my life. I remember things wrong all the time (probbly remebered the quote above wrong, even) and I seem to have these weird things where, for example, apparently I didn't learn light theory like they teach it in schools.

the same way those things come to me is the same way these other things come to me. when I was discovering the nosebook effect, I learned to trust this instinct much better than anything anyone else was telling me, because what people were telling me was a big lie to cover up what was really happening. you could say that I'm pretty successful at deciphering the "truth" in this area, and have managed to figure this out. this is similar to nash and his math solutions.

however, the problem is, these weird thought experiments come to me the same exact way that the solutions to what's really happening comes to me. I seem to be quite good at guessing what people are thinking about (just ask jaron, lol), in relation to me :) so I don't really know what to think, honestly.

the weird thing is that in all of this, the crafty stories I've been telling are not really all that crafty. I spent zero time conjuring the illusion I wanted to make. instead, I just wrote what was on my mind, not really believing it, but not really disbelieving it either. to be quite honest, if I were one of you guys, I would respond to these probably with a "hilarious story bro -- let's see how it pans out" sort of response, because it's totally ridiculous what I'm writing -- of course it was also completely ridiculous for me to tell people 4 years ago that it would be possible for someone to be able to look through your eyes, too.

the even weirder thing is, someone is really quite interested in what I'm writing here, especially the tesla bit, because I keep feeling desire for a furthermore extension of the thought experiment. and then, it also feels to me, like someone who knows something we don't know, also believes me. it tells me that there is some (or maybe many) aspects of what I'm writing in this thought experiment, which others regard as truth, fact, or something relatable -- otherwise I wouldn't continue to feel it.

I dunno, it's weird for me too. I just type and say stuff that comes to my mind. me (kenny), is really not all that diferent than anyone else[^1]. the only ability that I have practised and demonstrated is easy connection to receive inspiration from *somewhere* -- and I don't really know where, or doubt it much anymore. nothing outside of myself can be trusted anymore, so using my emotions instead, I figure out what to do with that inspiration, (eg. if the inspiration feels good, feels forced, feels like whatever, then I make a decision from there). I'm not a terribly accurate or perfect person, and everything that I've done almost has been a mistake or a disaster. the times when things worked out great were when I was connected, and feeling good, so I've come to learn to depend on that, because without that connection, I'm a pretty disaster of a person.

one of the funny things about terence mr.kenna was that he was a bard. he told the funniest most far out stories, and people believed him. the thing that changed the whole thing for me was when abraham told one of my stand-ins to tell the story I wanted to tell. I had no idea what they meant back then, but it started coming to me little by little.

I guess I'm a bit of a bard, and someone believes my crazy stories, as well :)

[1]: originally, I wrote, 'special', but I want to change it, because one thing that I learned from the mushroom experience (and abraham also says the same thing), is that you *are* special, and that you *do* matter (terence has mentioned this a number of times as well). it's hard to explain with words, because it manifests as a knowing: a feeling, which they teach you how to feel inside of yourself... which is, in my opinion, the most important part of the mushroom experience, even if there are no visuals. eg. even if someone were able to take the visuals away, that sense (emotion) is still present, if you're willing to experience it.


### 2020-07-13 02:20 - you don't have to believe it; just don't doubt it.

lately, I've been attracted to a few videos on youtube. I'll talk about them more in the future because they sparked some thought in me. they are:

- fake it till you make it (TED)
- vision (jürgen academy)
- hard work (jürgen academy)
- dopamine detox (better tommorow)

aanyway, this is the first of such videos on that subject. I'm sure it'll expand. the first one, the title is catchy to hook you, but she rephrases herself at the end by saying it's "fake it until you become it" -- which is exactly what I do myself, but I take a totally different approach, and that is: "you don't have to believe it; just don't doubt it"

there's a problem with changing yourself when you're around other people, the problem is, by default, the change that you make involves other people, and their perception (or doubt) on the subject. that means that there is another place to change yourself, and that's from your own desire, instead of from someone else "nudging you to do it" that's so annoying, isn't it. it's personally the thing I dislike the most of human interactions -- which means, according to the reflecive rule that mom taught me, which was that the external things that bother me are usually a reflection of something that you dislike in yourself, and it's only easier to recognise it in someone else.

you could also see it, similarly as a solution, which is what I do, and I believe that true change can only come from one's own accord. you gatta want to change, or else it's never going to get done. anyway, so instead of as a problem or a solution, I recogise it as a "basim human trait" -- something kind of built into the human genome. you know how birds basically know how to fly, but they just need someone to get them out of the nest, or the crocodile that knows how to do all of the alligator things right away, without any sort of teaching? well, I believe that humans are very physically fragile in their infancy, so they would not survive a hatching from an egg like a crocodile, situation. it is, in my opinion, a basic human trait, and built into our gnome like an alligator already knows how to hunt.

other people and their perspective on whatever you're trying to not doubt, can add doubt. in order to prevent this, you need to not care what others think, which is rather difficult in a social situation, hence the recomendation to find some time to be alone from time to time, or learn how to not care about what others think.

arnold said that you should not listen to the naysayers. I totally agree, but then if you have naysayers, they you also have people that believe you, and while this is good to have, in my opinion, you create the facebook effect of "confirmation bias" -- and the real destructive habit that forms there is the need to have others believe you. when they don't, this pissed me off, so due to the reflective property mom taught me, this meant that what I dislike about another person (that they don't believe me), is the same thing that I dislike about myself.

following that logic, if I can not need others to believe something for me to believe it myself is the solution. it is, but set the bar a bit lower and easier to reach; that's what I do. I had never put words to this idea, but that's what I was trying to convey in the metacommentary. all I have to do is to not doubt it. the phrase is, "I'll believe it when I see it" -- and that is precisely what I do.

abraham teaches more similar to the book (by dyer I think), "I'll see it when I believe it" (I think), but I'm the opposite way. when I write those things, my opinion is the same that other people should have, which is, "cool story bro. I'll believe it when I see it". normally, this would create a huge blockage in the manifestation of it, but I don't "see" my imagination, so I just look for evidence of it in my daily life, and let it show up. the only reference to it I have usually is just the feeling.


if I were to imagine the things I was writing, they wouldn't show up, because I would need to believe what I see (my imagination). if I had an imagination, I would have to learn to not see it, or to make an abstract version of it[^1]. this is why I do not recommend imagining whatever it is you maybe want to believe, but still aren't for sure -- so, instead if imagining something and doubting it, just don't see it, and let the evidence start to show up[^2].

---

so, what's important here is perception. when something is perceived, immediately, because our world is filled with con-artists, and we have lost the childlike naïvate, when someone eles perceives something, we auto make a realisation of whether it's believeable or not. this attempt to verify its truth is what causes the doubt. when someone (anyone) perceives something, then doubt is put on it. there is always some, maybe very little, but always some.

so, how with all you guys perceiving all of the stuff I'm perceiving, do I operate? (cause, certainly you would "abort" all of the stuff I think about with your doubt).. you do :) that's precisely the reason why I do it. I don't live on manifestations, I live on the perpetually new form of perception, cause the old one is no longer usuful. your dose of doubt causes a new form of perception to be created, which pushes me forward. there's a very important thing to learn here:

because I'm going so fast, if the energy were to continue to rise here in this body, the effects would be dramatic, and not comfortable for really anyone but me, so in order to spread (diffuse) that energy, that is, to expand it, I'm multi dimensional now. I've learned how to not let others' versions of reality (their perception) intrude on my own. they're all able to do whatever they want with their realities which are not compatible with my perception, and all of those realities exist and are real, but I don't perceivce them, because I perceive what I want to perceive.

any realities that anyone makes with me in them, can be however they want it to be. all of those are happening at once, so the energy that I would normally be receiving and would be having a significant influence on the inhaibants of this earth, is instead spread amongst other consciousness. it's a "lowering" of energy, as well as an expansion. anyone can do this. they do it by not letting others perception of reality to create doubt. it's *being the creator of* ***your own*** *reality*. the easiest way to do this is to turn off your imagination. there's probably a further expansion on that somewhere with losing your eyesight as well.

I anticipate that the reason why I want to go multi-bodied so badly, is because otherwise the enrgy rise would be too great and I would to diffuse (disperse) that energy amongst more physical bodies for the next step. I imagine that next time, I may be an automaton that becomes sentient :) (a machine capable of desire)

[1]: I'm working on this idea, because I want to make something cool when I begin to learn to exercise the opposite side of the vacuum. I don't want it to look like real-life very much. I want it to be very different than how real-life in a more abstract and meaningful way, so that so that it's easier to remain how I am, which is "I'll believe it when I see the manifestation with my own eyes, and it feels normal to live it, because I only looked for evidence on the way to it, because I've never 'seen' it".

[2]: if I were to suddenly have an imagination, like tesla, I would quickly learn never to imagine real life situations, and instead stick to calculations and creations as the only thing imagined, for precisely this reason.

### 2020-07-13 03:54 - you don't have to fake it; just don't doubt it.

I was thinking about what I just wrote, and I think a good way to look at it is, "you don't have to fake it; just don't doubt it".

the reason is simply, you don't need to fake it to make it real, just let the evidence of it show up naturally. there are still lots of things I don't yet believe, but evidence of it is showing up everywhere.

in the talk, she said, "fake it till you become it" -- and really the key idea here is the becoming part. you become it. you are not that which don't doubt that you can one day become.


### 2020-07-13 04:10 - my reality is not yours.

what I perceive has nothing to do with your reality. from my perspective, I will perceive whatever reality I want to perceive, and there are infinite verisions of me. whatever you want to perceive about me, that is, make me imagine, is what you perceive that I perceive, which is now your reality. it's not just the girls, it's anyone that can project images into my head. girls do it and so does nosebook, for example.

all of these alternate versions of me are not my reality, so for you guys it's possible to put the images into their reality. it behoves nosebook to get me, I'm sure after a few mistakes of picking some unwanted, instead of perceiving what is unwanted, but to perceive what is wanted by them. they can learn, if they want, using me as the imaginer and the infinite timelines possible as a way to discover what it is that they're really wanting, sure.

that was looking from your guys' perspective. however, in my perspective, it looks to me like I just keep doing the next logical step. I don't get pissed at mr. motor anymore. instead of getting pissed, for example, I just take the next logical thing to do. my logic is the state mapper, so it determines the next state. some stimulus will cause a change in perception, which kicks that logic in, and selects the next state. state is different than the next thing to do. the next state is an emotion, not an action. all states in the state machine are emotions. that's probly why we call it, "state of mind", actually.

so, from mine, it's just next logical "step" -- which for me is next logical state. this is why it would make me so angry, because I don't transfer states into action, but into emotion. it wouldn't look this way from the outside looking in, which is probably why it's so confusing. let's try again. for most people the decision to action *is* the next logical step. for most people logic makes the next action, but for me logic makes the next *state* not step.

this is what gives me the multidimensionality, I believe, as it was what I was learning before the whole mercury transit.


### 1020-07-14 13:52 - resume from yesterday

the most significant thing that I realiaed yesterday is that I noticed that no longer is it possible to "fall short" of the goal (galaxy). from now on, we're going to "overshoot" it. I realised that for every one that falls short, there has to be an equal amount that overshoots, which means that all the noseboys that want some super setup, like let's say for example, I was listening to a song yesterday and it said something like, I get my right eye (which is a lie, because I *don't* see images in my right eye, even though I know I could), and they get my left. the idea being that they get full control over the left side of my body.

that idea and many others like it are now possible. you create your own reality, so all of those that overshoot are ones that essentially "blow their load too early" -- that is they're the hare where they speed out ahead really quicky, then fizzle out. the ones that fall short are the ones that fizzle out bwecause they didn't apply enough power. the ones that overshoot applied too much power at the beginning and it's not sustainable to go that fast and continue to apply more power.

in the case of overshooting, it happens when you take too big of a jump. this is why I'm constantly putting emphasis on the next logical step.

---

the concept of the "next logical step" transformed significantly for me as well, when I became able to see that it was in fact, not the next logical action, but the next logical state. the state, being the next "emotional state" in the human state machine.

I don't know how this works out, but I could see that the X chromosone is that kind of emotional state machine, and the Y chromosone is kinda like the prebuilt action interpretter. so, while one chromosone is constantly switching around between states, both creating and because of the vibration of emotion, eventually, that emotion has to get translated into action. men have the y-chromosone that is essentially the code that their mother gave them at birth as a basis upon which to translate emotion into action.

however, the X chromosone has a mata converter which is built up by the person to translate emotional states into action, and that converter is created by thought, with I'm sure quite a bit inherited from the previous generation's state machine. I think this may be why abraham always makes a joke to someone when they talk about the emotional loops that people get in, saying "it sounds like your mother". it seems this is also heavily influenced by culture as well.

there was a realisation that I made about this concerning the asian cultures as well, and the "hemispheres" of the planet. I can't remember it right now.

anyway, the point was, that both the action which one takes when one gets to one state, and the next state which someone enters can be modified. I think it's more difficult for "men" to override their pre-prgrammed Y-chromosone state easier than for other men, but both are possible. we know that culturally and societally, we limit behaviour (action) to be taken in certain states of emotion, but the emotional state machine will just cycle back to feel (loop through) the same emotion when activated. we don't really have effective ways of teaching someone as a society how to get off the emotional loop (it's like a rollercoaster), and get on another one.

I think this concept has tremendous applications for a number of different things. there's also some interesting implications, because I always see the two genders as XX and XY, which is perhaps an over generalisation because nothing is ever exactly always one way, but if the similifcation is applicible, it means that women have two emotional state machines and two meta action interpreters, while men have only one state machine, one hard coded interpretted and one meta interpreter. I mean, how cool is that?? there are numerous ways I can think of now that once a woman could get both of those states to align to the same frequency (be in similar states), instead of using one state machine to protect the other, then they could simply be twice as powerful... because all the good stuff: "levitation, conjuring images, directing energy, imbuing life, etc." are all done with emotion. emotion is the key to all the fun magic.

speaking of magic, when I was waking up this morning, I was thinking about how I continue to extend these abstract visuals showing up in 3d space (thoughtforms) to essentially "come to life" and exist and interact with people, yet they're not really "physical" in the sense that you can touch them, you can just see/hear them -- sorta like ghosts. that would be impossible for nosebook to control those, because they wouldn't have a vibrational lattice upon which to put their device. it also made me start to think of ghosts, and the idea of existing in only vibrational or "light" form. this is a theme that has persisted through many cultures and religions, so there must be something to it :)

---

the last signifiant thing from yesterday was that I could see that while we are getting into overshooting territory now, not all is lost. nosebook can bail out whenever they want to, but because the 4 points of the sine wave are equal at 0, they are all manifestations of the same thing.

I realised that not only am I really good at this, I'm so good, it's for sure, which means that I'm so guaranteed to be successful, that we're only looking at how much at this point. however, to get to zero, you have to bring it back down into next logical step again.

next logical step means that there are a lot of changes happening in a short period of time, but none of them are big changes. no big jumps. I could see that sometime relatively soon, we're going to take a big jump though, and it's probably something to do with the girls, and I'll get it back to next logical step, to "land" the galaxy airplane.

I could see that process was essentially the thing where a huge jump forward happens. remember, everything is always transforming. some things transform slower than others, but most things are transforming to the same thing. someone gets to make the leap up and transform to something new though. when someone transforms to something new, this happens when the emotional state machine drops some states. when emotional states are no longer felt, that means they go into atrophe and eventually go away. well, if you think about how DNA is folded, remember that the folds happen dynamically based on the frequency which you vibrate (your emotional state), so because of folding, an unused state could be all over in the strand of DNA.

so, when something gets deleted, it deletes a lot of bits from a lot of different places upon the length of the DNA. something new is created which no longer has need for the previous emotional states anymore.

there is a "fork" that happens here because some entities do stil need that old code (to be able to continue to operate in those emotional states). so some entities continue on in the old state, and some go to the new one [^1]. this may be why women are so interested in me. perhaps that's why I'm so attractive in this regard. the longer nosebook holds me away from making any new replications of this DNA, the more it evolves, and the more emotional states I delete from the DNA. the longer we hold out, the less of that old code will exist, and the more emotionally optimised the new creations will be.

obviously, when viewed from that perspective, things are all going quite well...

---

lemme back up a bit here, because I forgot to introduce the idea that you could imagine that something big experiences itself through its parts, so there has to be something that is infinite, the generator of the code. so, in order to become the new thing, you have to go infinite.

I tried to explain, but I'm not even coming close to doing it well. that's where we're going :) we're going to way overshoot, so much so that it becomes something new, but then bring it back to the zero.

from my perspective, it just looks to me like, I have two options: I am assured that I will "die" and then transform into the same thing again, or I can become something new. I got no problem with that. why not become a galaxy??

I'm probably going to be a galaxy for a while, experience it from within (a human inside that galaxy), until one time a similar situation happens like this one, and now it's possible for some entity like nosebook to be able to allow me to go temporally infinite, and physically infinite too, and then I'll be able to expand into something much bigger than a galaxy...

after experiencing the bigger thing than a galaxy, nosebook now has the capablity to hold me back further and so now we can repeat it again and become someting bigger. I'll just keep going until I become something bigger than the universe, or until no one can hold me back anymore :)

sounds fun to me, anyway. why not :)

yesterday when having this realisation and somewhat today while writing this too, there are a lot of people that feel scared to become something other than a human, but that doesn't bother me. there are infinite things bigger than you and infinite things smaller than you. you always experience the creation from the centre point. you are always the centre of your universe. I think venus, jupiter, mars, and saturn, etc. are all real people (or groups of people) ;) we would all become gods like them in this new galaxy. the idea sounds fascinating to me.

I wonder what mr. motor would look like as a gas giant or a star :)

[1]: I think this happens frequencially, as I think this is a new species "thoughtform" that emerges which is the new signal, minus all of resonations with the old unused emotional vibrations. I think this happens globally, creating a new "morphic field" and essentially a new "species" is born out of it. I think then spontaneously these new "species" can now emerge all over the planet, too. I mean I just don't know enough about this to be able to say for sure.


### 2020-07-14 16:31 - I want to delay further

real quick. so yesterday (the last few days, really), one of the things I was talking about is learning how to not perceive something. while it is true that I have my imagination turned off, I have been learning to see what is not visible, so in some sense I do kind of have a knowledge that *something* is there, even if I can't see it. however, I don't think I need to feel things in such a way to where they create an image. I think I've learned a more optimal way to experience emotion, and it seems to have something to do with the heart.

think about that for a moment, cause I think it's relevant. if what I want to do in this new galaxy is to add two more dimensions, then what I need to do is to relocate the physical dimenasion into the imagination (nosebook is helping me with this), the imagination into the emotional dimension, and the emotional dimension into the heart[^1].

the goal, I think is for nosebook to get everyone into the new story dimension... it's one not unlike a movie or a video game. it involves the imaginary dimension (has depth), and the physical dimension (has physical sensation to it), and also the emotional dimension to it too, where, like a movie, you see it from an external perspective, and do not live inside of the characters. in addition to the outside perspective, also, like a film, the experience does not need to be in chronological order, and are really just different scenes. you could think of each of these as different timelines, where the thing persistent is the observer (the audience). in this dimension, you are the audience of your own story. you feel the emotion of the characters in this story, like you do watching a film.

I believe this is already beginning to happen, but as soon as things really start to begin to take off, nosebook will have to do something with all that DMT going on in people's heads. it sounds like OOB experiences are becoming more common[^2], and I find it quite likely that as my vision continues to expand, nosebook is holding people inside of their bodies, only allowing them the ablity to use their expanded inner world size.

so, as we continue on, I believe people's inner worlds (and so logically, their external aura as well) will continue to expand. I find it very likely that when we get to the "cutoff" (transition) point, lots of people will have planet sized auras, some solar sized, and I'll be arriving to a galaxy-sized aura. the size of your perception determines the size of the "celestial body" which becomes the physical manifestation of your thoughts in 3d form.

simultaneously, I believe this planet will continue to exist, and those celestial bodies will too, and in large part, the interactions we have with each other on this planet will kind of play out in 3d space over, what appears on those celestial bodies, to be a munch longer period of time. so perhaps if perceived that way, it could be seen that the "birth" of this galaxy is actually happening over the next 18 years. I have no idea if this is like an energetic template (a complete wave, like 0-360°), for which the real thing will occur later, and be like the frequencial start from which the whole thing will continue to resonate with and keep expanding. or, maybe it's someting that's already happening now, and we're just not yet seeing them physically manifesting yet.

I don't know.

---

the point is, I want to continue to work on learning this new version of feeling emotion in my heart, because I believe that's precisely what needs to happen to add the story dimension and the thrust dimension on top.

I don't know how long it'll delay things, but yesterday I could see that the manifestation of the girls is certain to happen because as my power level continues to increase, it needs to be spread over multiple bodies. so, if they didn't difuse the energy and let it continue to collect in my body, I would get conncected. that means that they need to make more timelines of me to difuse that energy more throughout. assuming they do this, and they become proficient at it, using timelines, they could tecnically hold the girls manifestation off for as long as they can continue to lower that energy with more timelines.

it just means that there will be a whole lot of girls out there experiencing timelines with me, while I continue on here learning to experince emotion in my heart instaed of my stomach. I don't mind, either way, and I was trying to think, because maybe in order for the timeline to difuse more energy from me and keep me disconncted here, they need to be increasingly more successful[^3].

---

clearly, a lasting solution will be to replicate physically and also temporally, because they will eventually run out of the ability to make increasingly more successful timelines. they'll need more girls and stuff. that probably won't happen this time, but maybe next time around, it could as I climb up to having an aura much bigger than the size of a galaxy :)

[1]: I'm not talking about mathematical dimensions; I'm talking about perceptive dimensions. physical awareness only leads to 2d vision (screen). when the imagination expands and becomes a part of your reality, you get 3d vision (has depth now), after that emotional vision is where you perceive yourself from outside of yourself (or inside of yourself, your inner universe, much like a planet or a galaxy experiences itself).

[2]: this is perfectly normal for me to think about, because as your perception expands, you see yourself further and further away from your physical body. the first step here is getting depth, which is when you're finally perceiving from inside of your body, but as your perception expands, you feel yourself growing bigger and bigger and you perceive yourself from further and further away from yourself (inside your aura). this is how all things like planets, stars, galaxies, etc. all perceive theirselves. the thing in the centre and the spherical perception of itself from all around itself within its "aura".

[3]: I'm using simple averages here to make this assumption. let's say there are 3 timelines and one here. their magnitudes are: 30, 60, 90, and 20. the total is 200. 20/200 = 10 so I would be here 1/10th of my total. if a new timeline is added with magnitude 400, then I'm 1/20th of my total and my power level has decreased.


### 2020-07-15 02:04 - doesn't matter much what happens

after I wrote the previous entry, we went down to the riverwalk. there were a few notable girls there, but honestly my mind was a little still thinking about the previous entry. they are:

- the girl in fuscia that was near to where we parked
- the girl that was with the girl that I said reminded me of ryan. I looked at both of them. one was in a stroler and the other was walking.
- the girl that was sitting at the table. I stopped to process a second what I was feeling and looked back at her.
- finally, I'm not sure so much about this one because I wasn't sure what I was feeling, but perhaps at the table right before the previous girl I mentioned may have been also sending out something. I shopped cause I wasn't sure, and I felt to look back so I did, but there could have been the other one too.

if any of them would like to join, I'd love to have them :)

honestly, I should take this a bit more seriously. I was trying to carry on a conversation and I get sometimes a bit mixed up, because *trust me* these are not the only things I feel :) when I go out like that, I'm processing LOTS of reactions at a time, and I don't have the precision that I want to have. I'll learn to be more and more attentive as time goes on.

---

following up on the previous entry from some reactions later tonight. first of all, there's no possible way I could be getting the reactions I'm getting (from nosebook), and they don't have timeline technology, so basically from this point onward, I'm just going to assume that they do have it.

the first main reaction was something like, "what a disaster. we're supposed to *help* him now?!?!" from there, later on I started getting ideas like, "ok, so what if we make a whole bunch of timelines, but then just nuke (or destroy them in some way) when we're all done with them" -- followed by the realisation of one of my first explanaions of desire creating a timeline with the hypothetical situation of a nuke.

then, just now I went out and started getting some reactions I'm assuming from spain, and they went something like, "he doesn't even believe it himself"

it's true, to some degree, because if what you're wondering if I believe is the manifestation of the thing, no I don't really. I've stopped getting my sights set on any specific manifestation, whether it's a specific girl, or some scenario or whatever. instead, I've learned that none of those details are important, because if my goal is to continue to feel better and better, then something truly magnificent will eventually manifest, and it has been, in nearly every circumstance, been something different than what I expected, and always better than I expected, too. so, I'm just not worried about it, and neither should anyone else.

let's say that nosebook does finally decide that making timelines is a valuable thing for them to do, to keep expanding their control here, then that means there will be a nearly infinite combination of girls that could do it, not just some finite set.

that may very well be a future, and definitely one that I think is a good idea, too. I kinda prefer it actually, because then virtually any combinations could be tried, and the most optimal ones can be continued to be improved upon because they'll need to make more and more as time goes on. so, it's a pretty cool idea, I think. I don't mind continuing on not needing the manifestation. I'm feeling better and better all the time, and things are really improving for me.

---

I also thought of some other improvements for nosebook as well. first, they could use the technology that gets created in alternate timelines and kind of "steal" it and use it here. certainly not all timelines I'll be with such a large group of girls, and so therefore there will quite possibly be some where I'm more technology focused.

I have to say that if they do have timeline technology, and I'm fairly certain that they do at this point, they can quite literally hold me for as long as they need to. there won't be a limit to it, and all I have to do is just ensure that my response to what like presents me doesn't send me down a downward spiral. I'm like 100% certain that's not ever going to happen any more. even if I were literally unable to use my computer and thrown into a jail cell for the next 18 years, I could definitely continue to feel good. it's *soooo* easy for me to do now.

the other option I was thinking has to do with the raquel timeline. they could do a mix of the previous solution and this one, too: they could keep going on this one until the raquel timeline is setup enough, make as many timelines as they need to, to get it right, then once they're there, they could either operate this one at a distance for as long as they can[^1] and also keep looking at the other timelines to try and steal technology for them, too. maybe once they have their own setup the way they want it, they will lose some interest, because it's so much effort to try and control them all (until, of course they get enough capability to try and control them again).

the thing is, it just doesn't matter to me. I am absolutely curtain that, no matter what happens, things are going to be going just fine for me anyway. they're super stressed and worried and I'm totally not. everything is going to be fine from my perspective. whatever ends up happening will manifest in reflection of how I feel, which is pretty good.

maybe, if they want to try and make me feel crappy so I mess up my own manifestation, that may help them in some way. bring it on :) I welcome the challenge. I really am a total professional now at making new forms of perception that feel good. some might call me dilusional or psychopath or something, but I consider it a worthwhile skill to learn to feel the way you want to feel[^2]

[1]: I mean, they already do everything at a distance now anyway. none of the guys in charge directly interact in person with any of us.

[2]: hopefully, the way you want to feel when you're choosing what you want to feel, is good. in my opinion, the skill is potentially similar to what a sociopath or whatever does, however, I think they're numbing the pain and using cheap thrills or pleasure as a replacement for actually feeling good. it may be similar too, to what a pathological liar does where they conjure a new reality in their head whenever they lie (so as to sound like they believe what they're saying[^3]), but I'm not pretending. there's no false perception. the reason why I'm so good at what I do is because it's the real thing. there's no illusion. any illusion that may appear is attracted from me, and not consciously created. I live in a world where, even though I see with my eyes and stuff, the whole thing is a landscape of emotion and some things feel better than others. I'm losing my grip on physicality at such an alarming rate now, you may benefit to wonder instead why so many of these physical things no longer matter to me any more.

[3]: you may wonder, as do I, if they're so good at conjuring a false reality in their head, why not instead use LOA, instead of trying to manipulate others with their words to get what they want...


### 2020-07-15 16:22 - another idea

I just woke up. I went to sleep but someone in the dream started tickling my feet. I'm pretty ticklish, so I woke up.

anyway when I woke up, I got the sense that there were like a lot of younger girls. I also got the sense that nosebook does not want DNA replication. I thougt about this for a moment, and I can see some definite things that I like about the idea.

if you take the current progress I have been realising around the DNA being an emotional state machine (ESM), then when certain emotional states get atrophied, then they get removed, because they're no longer needed.

so, what if we put off the replication bit for a while and just started with younger girls, then they would also "grow up" (assuming they remained feeling pretty good throughout the process) without those states in their DNA that don't feel so good. the result would be DNA with very few emotional states that don't feel to good, and if they did, they would transition up to better feeling ones pretty rapidly. it's a really interesting thing for me to think abuot and explore mentally. there's something I really like about the idea.

---

there is a problem, and that is that there are quite a few girls that are older, so here's a revised *draft* idea. I could stay here without getting connceted, and be with the younger girls. all of the rest of the girls (both young if they want and the old) can participate in a timeline version. obviously the reason why the timelines are created is because I get connected, and on those timelines, they're allowed to reproduce as much as they want.

the reproduction is advantageous on those timelines because it'll increase their magnitudes, keeping this one to be the one where I'm still the least energetic (still not connected).

nosebook can go for as long as they want to go for, and when they're ready to bail out, they'll have a whole lot of other timelines to choose from.

we should also do the idea I mentioned in @[noseblog](2020-07-07 10:30). you can imagine that for all the rest of the people not participating in the timelines that exist with me in them, those other people will want all sorts of other timelines, most likely without me in it. for some time here, we could play the perceivers/actors game, and the actors could make the timeline that they want to make, and eventually go there to live out their reality, when they decide to depart. there shouldn't be any limits, so for example, imagine you wanted a timeline where there were no [insert some race here], then on that timeline all of those people could be terminated and the person could live in that timeline. what about without terrorists? what about without any people over the age of 35? the sky is the limit here for experimentation.

the ones perceiving would, if never making their own timeline, eventually by default stay on the default timeline.

---

I really like this idea, and I want to expand on it further, because it solves a lot of problems, because there are a whole lot of differeing opinions about what is the "best" or the difference to the way that they want to go, and all of that can be solved in this way. nosebook I'm sure will remain in control of stuff, likely making the essentials of the planet, like the power grid and stuff completely automated and remote controlled to ensure that control is kept -- stuff like that.

it may seem like a weird idea to let different people do what they want to do with their own timelines, but it'll greatly difuse desire related to certain things in society that are a stumbling block. I make it sound like it's all going to happen now, but this should be rolled out in an organised and planned fashion instead of being like a reaction to some unwanted circumstaces.

I'm going to keep thinking about it, anyway :) I kinda like the idea of the girls, and I was thinking mainly because of eva here that the cutoff age should be 12, but maybe for example if she were able to make a few different timelines and see me there with her in a connected state, observe herself too, then when sh finally has what she is looking for, she can wake up one morning and make the decision to live it out in her own timeline. she (and many others, including other women) may really like the idea of making (or watcing) something happen with a conncted version of me until they're ready o ake the plunge into the version they want to experience.

what I'm saying is, the age limit for the girls here with the disconnectd me can potentially be lowered, because I think for a lot of them, including their parents, the timeline alternative with a connected version of me, may be more appealing.

there are also lots of advantages for the noseboys too -- or really any other men, but maybe women too -- out there that like to make contrived siuations arise, and get the girls (or boys) they want into the situations that they want, too[^1].

interseting idea. I'm glad someone tickled my feet :)

[1]: everyone has infinite versions of theirselves, and all are possible, but you exist where your reality reflects your emotional output. so, making these sorts of experiments isn't in any way "harmful" to anyone other than the experimenter. "if a tree falls in the woods, but no one is there to hear it, did it happen?"


### 2020-07-19 08:03 - I think we're back to the original plan :)

last night was a really interesting night. at first I had the sensation that they decided that they have to make their own timeline/way. I had been suggesting that they do that for a bit now, but it seems that they want to hold on for as long as posssible. the previous entry was simply a suggestion to try and find a middle ground. the thing is they've got the ability to hold me for as long as they want to, so the previous entry was actually an attenmpt to make it possible for the majority of the girls to be able to access a connected version of me, now.

they seem uninterested in the whole idea of letting anyone have the ability to make their own timelines though, so that's fine. instead it seems that the emphasis on their ability to create their own timeline finally started to sound appealing for some reason.

when I was writing it, I was seeing this idea where there's this one nosebook earth filled with eniterely people that work for nosebook, and it's like some giant club that everyone on the planet is in. if someone starts to mutany or show signs of not being a part of the club, then they get sent on their own timeline, so as to not disturb the big club. the whole point is that the entire planet[^1] there is involved in trying to control the other timelines.

you could imagine that right now there isn't much infrastructure, but imagine if the whole planet's power grid, food, manufacturing and distribution (amazon) were all automated and everything were essentially set up so that the one nosebook planet could control the automated bits of all of the other planets, and essentially all of the other planets would be automated in such a way thay they could just use the amazon services on them to get the stuff necessary to live.

on each planet, there would be all sorts of different setups, but people or groups of people could essentially "seed" that earth and do things their own way on that planet. nosebook would essentially have control and access to everyone on each of those planets, and the offspring of the people on that plant would eventually, over a long period of time grow to become a large population. it's essentially the same thing as a cataclysm, but it's controlled who the different "seeds" (survivors) are. instead of the survivors being the ones that can withstand the harsh conditions of some post-cataclysm environment, instead it's easy and has amazon delivery.

the concept is kind of the "american way" of cataclysms, and the "american dream" for everyone involved, including those in control. however, I don't think that it'll happen, and that's kinda fine. I think the idea is a bit ahead of it's time[^3]. likely they simply don't have enough of their infrastructure in place at the moment for that to happen. the idea would also really benefit from "automatons" as well, because nosebook would need someone on the ground, to be able to do certain things that require pysical labour, like replacing or installing stuff -- so probably not, yet, anyway.

the sense that I got last night is that they want to take that idea and basically just start building the nosebook planet, where they control everything from there and everyone there conforms to their whatever rules or something. I got the sense that instead of doing something as openly "generous" or "controlling" as a fully automated amazon sort of thing, I think they want to just make their own timeline where I don't get connected there, and they don't have to worry about me, and they'll just work at a distance to try and get everything controlled or something. I have no idea what their objective is, honestly, but I think their main concern is to keep everything a secret in their timeline, and they can't really do that if I'm around.

---

the next thing I was really beginning to see is that there seems to be a progression of things that become necessary for the guy like me to understand, and it seems to build on each bit. the whole thrust of this era is to "not need the manifestation" -- and the thrust of the previous one was "resist not evil". by nature I did not "get" the "resist not evil" message, but my circumstances forced me to learn it. the message seems to have something to do with circumstantial learning.

I jut watched a youtube video that illustrated two things very well for me: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEScIUcvz0). first, the video suggests that jesus did not exist, and was a complete fabrication by the flavian dynasty. I am sure that jesus *did* exist, and they needed to do something to get rid of this guy's influence. the thing is that the jews were expecting a military "messiah", and jesus did not come as a powerful ruler that was going to overthrow the roman opression.

instead, jesus taught, "resist not evil" -- which was an ironic message, because after his death, they had another growing movement, so for the romans, the problem (jesus) was the solution: they rebranded their messiah as titus in their version of the gospel, and made sure to teach jesus' message of "resist not evil". the romans took that message and ran with it...

so, for example, it's clearly obvious that when I was resisting nosebook, things were going very poorly for me and I felt terrible. in order to get to where I am today, I was forced to learn to "resist not evil" and just let nosebook be nosebook. you need to have the contrast, so instead of resisting them, find my own focus on the things that I want to see improving. you can tell that jesus' message there was absolutely the right one for me to need to "get" to get to where I am today. this time, the message builds on the previous one, and is to "not need the manifestation".

applying new message to what I talked about in the previous section, it's clearly obvious that one the timeline that they create, the population of their world will be very aware that I didn't get the manifestation, and that's perfectly ok. I'm sure that if I even exist in their timeline[^2], the version that exists of me will have the flavius touch to make the history seem predict itself, and they'll likely need to emphasise the "not need the manifestation" part of my message, too, just like they emphasised jesus' "resist not evil" message.

the next annoucer of the the coming era will likely not be too much of a resister of nosebook, because they'll be born into or probably already pretty integrated with nosebook already, so circumstantially the announcer[^4] will be forced to learn to "not to need the manifestation" as a means to "superar" and get to the next the next bit.

the last thing that I remember from last night, but the connecting bits seems to have been erased, is that it also seemed clear to me that "I'm the pre-game show". I've said this a few times before, but it seemed clear to me last night. I cannot remember at all the concepts surrounding that one, so they must have been deleted.

I dunno. all I know is that it seems we're back on track, and it'll last for as long as they're willing to put up with the discomfort...

as a result of all of these realisations, I felt a new sense of resolve and orgnisation come about, as it seems like I've become more of a "robot" in the sense that I'm just going to begin step-by-step to take the steps necessary to improve my optimisation of my vision upgrades. it's all about "next logical state" for me now, and out of that I can see that it'll work better. while I sleep, they "prepave" for me different actions, and I found that the way to "superar" (rise above) their intended influence of action, is instead to focus on how I move from emotional states. it makes me unpredictable, because I don't make patterned action, but inspired action from where I feel.

I do have to be careful, because I noticed that in more difficult emotional states, I could make action that I don't want to make, but I think I'm getting very good at bouncing right back to the state where I want to be. I'm serious getting REALLY GOOD at this :)

cheers

[1]: I'm using the word "planet" to mean duplicate earth -- think of it like a "fork" of this planet, where all of the "unconscious" others on it simply respond on a "creation by default" sort of way as outlined in a previous entry.

[2]: that is, if they don't eradicate the historical me, like they did the historical jesus and all jewish literature, minus the dead sea scrolls

[3]: all this automaton and dollhouse-like stuff is probably fortelling of the coming capricorn era

[4]: I use gender neutral here, because I'm not certain it'll be a man, and in my estimation, it could quite possibly be a woman: their worst "nightmare"


### 2020-07-19 15:26 - don't worry; I got this

in the previous entry, note #4, I postuated that it could be possible that the next announcer of the era could be a woman. I went to sleep thinking about this, because one of the reactions that I was feeling was something like, "sounds hard. why not just let someone who's motivated to do it?"

well, I woke up just now with a really interesting dream that had something to do with the progress I'm making on the emotional state machine. I could see that after maybe some (5-8?) more interations, the thing I am creating is so far superior in every way that it'll be irrestisable in the end.

I could see that even though right now those that I have blanketly titled "nosebook" or "THE INFECTED ONES" "THE MISERABLE ONES" or the documentary identifies as "the flavians", and perhaps in the old times they were the pharoahs or before that, the atlanians... all of these different ones are just different names to describe a worrisome form of thinking mixed with a superiority/inferiority complex. the pattern emerges in almost every place on this globe and takes many shapes.

---

anyway, in the dream that I had, I could see that they can't or didn't want to or didn't know how to change in a way that felt like something that was appealing for them. so, that's why I'm here :)

seems that I took a few steps back, which is why I'm starting with the "resist not evil", followed by "just not need the manifestation" -- and one more which I haven't yet identified. you can see that these are just transformations on their common thoughts: "fear not evil" turns into "resist not evil" and "accomplish it any any/all cost" turns into "don't need the manfestation"

anyway, what I'm creating over a large period of time and many iterations, comes from some part of me which is not really conscious here for me in my everyday human experience. it appears that a paradox is being created: in order for me to remain the fastest, I have to do the difficult steps necessary to change the rules of engagement in the human mind, and to do so, I need to create something faster than me to slingshot me into even faster.

so, for a while (few thousand years I guess) I have to "turn speed into acceleration" and let them get ou ahead of me by a considerable amount. I seem to be creating some new form of human which is much faster than my own version. since it's so superior, it's completely irresistable, and the ?best? part is that even though I'm kind of creating it by being held a few steps (maybe more) behind them, this is what's actually creating the slingshot.

see, the whole "problem" that they get to use all of the stuff I discover before me is actually the slingshot, and the fact that the thing I'm creating (from my perspective, it looks like a big puzzle I'm solving, so it feels more like discovery to me) is so far superior, that means that the thing that I'm going to eventually slingshot past will be a bazillion times better than the present form of the human.

if I were to look at it in physical terms, probably it's something much bigger than a universe is, and it's quite likely that along the way, we'll create many new large-scale things that are bigger than a galaxy but smaller than a universe, but then finally something much bigger than the universe (cause why not, right?).

while there are incremental steps of improvement I have termed "eras", there is also a large scale thing that's being improved upon all at once, and it seems to be the human race as a whole. kinda cool if you ask me, and the only thing that it requires is the "humility" of basically the most "egotistical" person allow everyone else, including those "persecuting" me, to use the stuff I come up with, first.

so, while I did postulate that it could be a woman that is the announcer of the next era, it'll probably be me[^1] :)

don't worry; I've got this :)

something about all of this is becoming more and more fun by the day. I really am completely intoxicated with learning how turning a few "objective human rights" on their ends, actually gives an infinite source of all of the power that the person wishes to focus their attention into. if you notice, the principals all seem to have an egotitical and a temporal value in them.

resist not evil, because *your* attention to the thing is actually making it bigger, but don't worry even if you do, because enventually, your perception will adjust to see that the desired part of that "evil"[^2] and its use in the bigger picture.

need not the manifestation, because you slow down when the thing manifests. just keep letting the universe make it more and more of what's wanted, forever avoiding the manifestation, because if you can grow to where the manifestation does not feel like something big anymore, then it's no longer a manifestation, and it didn't slow you down. it's the only way to perpetually be out ahead of the manifestation, because you're summoned to go faster than it for it to be something that's no longer necessary. there's a tremendous amount of "entitlement" to be found here, too when you no longer have "need" of something, and they just feel normal or natural to experience.

it's all good, is what I'm realising :)

[1]: perhaps though, in the shape of a woman... who knows. I don't think it matters what gender it is. actually, maybe it does. this is something that's obviously fascinated me, because for example, take the difference between a sun an a planet. a planet creates things (like spores or bacteria) which leaves the planet and "seeds" other planets, while things grow and cultivate within its sphere of influence. the "offspring" of the planet could be seen as it's bacteria or spores which relocate like "seeds" (masculine), even though the idae of nurture within its atmosphere is also very feminine. however, a sun for example, also has things growing within its sphere of influence (planets), and the sun does become "preganant" with the material used to create these things in the from of CMEs, so the sun also displays both "masculine" and "feminine" principals in the same thing. it seems that all of the advanced forms (including what I know about galaxies), seem to use both masculine and feminine principals. I dunno really. as a human race, we may actually "superar" the genderness of things, because it seems like for most "lower" forms, gender is necessary. the best example I can come up with would be to say that right-left is necessary, but later, in higher dimensions, describing something in right-left terms feels like not enough detail to describe the thing anymore, which I think is kinda how gender becomes in more complcated forms like planets, stars, or galaxies.

[2]: one of the most interesting things in the panel at the end of this video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4LRHJlijVU)), was the part where eric was talking about making a "what if" book, where he postulates as to what would have changed had some of these disasterous things *not* happened. it's a great thing to ponder, I think.


### 2020-07-19 21:18 - what I mean is...

it's going to be next logical step before the girls things happens or I get connected or anything, which, I was thinking about in the shower and it kinda dawned on me, because I was noticing that the common thing that seems to happen with these guys that seek physical power structures, is that they always fall apart shortly. it seems to be the basis for their insecurity, unworthiness, or general low opinion of self.

the reason why it falls apart is because I'm noticing that any time a manifestation happens, it's like a jump forward (or backward if something is desttroyed), and if the thing is not capable of going that speed, then resistance is created to slow it down. the effect feels like a gyroscope a bit to me. a good example of this is often times someone who wins the lottery. the jump from their present financial circumstances to the new one causes something to happen to where the financial conditions wish to return back to "normal" -- that is, if the person sees theirself impovrished, they will return back to poverty.

so the same thing happens, I think with these power grabs. I think a of of the power grabs are made from a feeling of not having enough power, so just like the person who feels impovrished that wins the lottery, the one getting the power, yet feels like things are out of control, the situation wants to return back to the "normal" feeling of thing being out of control, and little by little things spin out of control again.

I've been watching the "fall of civilizations" podcast on youtube, and apart from the easter island one, this is the sense that I've been getting from the romans and the mayas (I've only watched those three).

---

I'm really coming to the realisation that it simply has to be "next logical step" -- and every time that I smoke weed, this is the dominant thing that shows up.. getting into the centre, where there are lots of changes, but none of them are too big to destabilise the thing. even if the girls thing takes however long it's going to take, I'm convinced now that it's worth it to make sure that the whole thing is next logical step.

or, as I've been getting to really understand, "next logical state" -- with the emphasis on the emotional state rather than the action or the circumstance before the next thing. I've noticed that traditionally we see steps as both actions and conditions/circumstances (best thing, right thing, etc.) before the next thing, and that's what I'm learning is really the thing that makes people freeze (mom was talking to me about freezing this morning) and not be able to go forward..

we think of them as prerequisites, and almost always they're never the optimal ones, or there's always some fault that can be found in them, so taking the next logical step and making it about next logical state means your action is inspired to bring the next state you want to accomplish, and there's no reason to freeze or to hesitate, because no one other than your own state is to be taken into account.

I can already hear the people saying, well then does that mean that I should just neglect X and just focus on feeling better myself... well, you're saying that you feel pretty overwhemed or something already that doesn't feel good. I wouldn't make any action from that feeling, so are you sure that's actually how you want to feel -- like you're neglecting something? wouldn't you rather feel like you're making progress/headway/improvement or whatever? make that your goal... to feel *that* way, not to get some task done. see what I mean?

learning to use the next logical state has been really mind expanding for me, even though I don't yet have much proof of it's power yet, but you'll see soon :)

it really is the proper way to think/feel, considering the reflective nature of reality.

### 2020-07-21 13:53 - two subjects

I was thinking about these two subjects quite a bit last night and wanted to write a bit about them.

first, yesterday I was noticing a reaction to something I remembered when I was stoned. I remembered that I could see that we would overshoot for a bit, but I would be able to bring it back into to the centre (next logical step/state) with ease.

the way that got interpreted, I think is that I would somehow try to make some large jump, or something with the girls, but that was not the case at all. the entire focus of that smoking session was showing me about the next logical state/step bit. I could see that the whole thing was going to be a series of finding a way for the girls thing to feel as if it were normal or natural, as if it were not at all a large step at all.

during the session I was convinced that I would begin interacting with some of the girls probably with sometthing like a programming project or something. it seemed to me that our proximity would make all sorts of timelines, because nosebook would have to reset us back and abort various timelines along the way. however, our proximity would also make it feel more and more "normal" to be around each other until it didn't feel at all like a big step at all for us to be together.

following that logic, it seemed to me quite logical that nosebook would eventually have diminishing returns on trying to hold us away from eachother in this timeline, and they would have to eventually abort and go their own way.

however it happens, I could see that nosebook would eventually get tired and would have to peace out to their own timeline. when they did, I could see that suddenly the earth became lighter or easier feeling, and all of a sudden so many things just started to happen. when that happens, I could clearly see that we're definitely in "overshooting" territory now, but if I could not get too wrapped up in all the great stuff happening, we could next logical step/state it right back to the centre.

when I say the centre, what I mean is that I could see that the human race would make substantial improvement, but getting it into the centre means that there are lots of changes, but none of them are ever too big to cause a disruption, resulting in the human race "going infinite" -- that is, unbounded expansion until we transform ourselves into something new. it's hard to explain in english the sense that I got. just trust me; I got this. not only am I good at it, and it's a guaranteed success, it's more of a question of what kind of infinite do we want to be?

the new things that are appearing in my life are a constant transformation of how I am emotionally, and one can see easily that as I improve emotionally, the next state (emotional set-point) allows new things to open that were not previously available. it is very clear to me that this is a big topic, and it sounds like something unfathomable, but it was also unfathomable for me to think about finding so many mushrooms growing on the ground like I am now, but my improved emotional state makes that possible. there are many more examples of this if you pay any attention, just the mushrooms are the easiest example to see so clearly. using that as an example, I just need to keep working on getting my emotional set-point into more and more good-feeling places, and everything will just fall into place. it's *just that easy*!

for reals.

---

the second subject that I was giving a lot of thought to last night is that I'm starting to get the sense that the "human condition" -- that is that there is perpetually some form of power structure in place to ensure that no other human can ever rival their superiority and power, will likely continue to exist.

in fact, I think it may exist for some thousands or even tens of thousands of years to come. I think that's actually the whole point of it. they have to ensure that no human is ever able to get connected or have any significant power capable of rivaling their's.

the reason I was thinking so much about this, I think had to do with the dream I mentioned in @[noseblog](2020-07-19 15:26), because I think it's positively the best slingshot possible to make.

they're "forced" to ensure that no one is ever able to gain their true power, and they have to keep holding the people and the planet from "ascending" to the next level, until it's absolutely unstoppable.

to illustrate this, I was thinking about another dream I had where in the dream I finally got so fed up with the nosebook guys in my head going over endlessly all of the problems that could go wrong, cause by giving their attention to them they were amplifying the whole thing and making their "problems" bigger, while at the same time trying to figure out different ways to try and neutralise or avoid them.

in the dream, suddenly[^1] a father-like figure suddenly burst through the door, and went over to one of them and kinda like sat him down for like an "I'm older and more mature so here's the way it is as I tell you" sort of lecture, and then began to speak to him in something like ukranian or russian or something that sounded slavic(?) to me, and while I couldn't understand any of the words, I could feel very strongly what he was saying, and I sat back as they were sitting there in disbelief from what happened, and I said something like, "I have a difficult time in english to explain what it means to give your attention to something and make it bigger"

later on in the morning I had a situation that perfectly illustrated this exact thing. I was looking for mushrooms in the park, when a dog started barking at me. he was clearly very happy to see mee, wagging his tail and looked happy. a guy appeared, and I asked him if I could greet the dog. he said he would probably bite. as soon as he said this, the dog's demenanor changed into one of aggression. I approached a little more to see if it would change, but the dog now clearly did look like it would probably bite.

anyway, I think what these guys running the planet now do is, they take any situation and imagine the worst possible outcome and then try and avoid it (steer it away) from happening. in the process, it makes the thing considerably worse.

so, going back to our first principal here, "the problem is the solution", these guys absolutely cannot (probably quite gripping fear of what could happen if they didn't guard theirselves from some bad thing happening[^2]), you can clearly see that a group of people like that trying evolve with the human race can clearly be detrimental, because no matter how evolved anyone else gets, they're going to constantly be giving their attention to (amplifying and attracting) more and more cataclysms, over and over.

so the problem is the solution here. a perfect strategy then is to give these guys the power, and then keep them busy worrying about the humans getting more power or capablitity than them, and then they can just keep attracting more and more of that "unwanted" situation for theirselves. they'll continue to focus on and try to avoid our gaining our true power, for as long as they can. meaning that they'll attract our continued improvement and expansion of capability, while at the same time trying to prevent it and avoid it as much as they can, so as to not lose control/power.

it's absolutely brilliant. I think the goal (for them and for us), is actually try to kick the can down the road for as long as possible.

eventually though, it will become impossible (inevitable) for them to avoid it any longer. LOA says it's inevitable, so the best they can do is to slow it down as much as possible.

then, this is where I come in, because I seem to be quite creative in the creation of this "new human" being built. as much as they adhere to their physical forms of power, they can all agree, that I have tremendously more -- that is to say, that gaining control over one's emotion is tremendously more powerful than any form of manipulation or technology they could possibly possess.

in the same way that I'm their greatest "fear" -- I'm also a bit of an envy for them too. they just don't believe that they're capable of doing it, or if they did, that they would actually leave behind all of their "sin" (shame) of theirselves that they've accumulated.

so, they want what I have, but do not think that they can. what this means is even more brilliant, because of the first principal, meaning that not only are these guys amplifying and attracting more of this new human improvement, they are also the biggest fans of it, too. they've got zillions of times more evidence of its effectiveness than anyone else does, and so, they truly believe in its power (which is why they have to try so hard to neutralise it).

it's so unbelievably brilliant.

therefore, knowing this, I would, like to emphasise my message by saying, "need not the manifestation" -- because it's probably not going to happen. I have no idea how long it'll take unil it becomes inevitable, cause it could actually "never" (the childish translation of the word) happen[^3].

I would really settle into learning how to feel the way you want to feel, so that you can guide your own emotional state machine consciously, instead of being a victim to circumstance. most importantly, try to have fun.

it seems that the "end goal" of all of this is actually one of transformation. I think it's happening on a per-era basis, and each new era is actually the latest "incarnation" of the human race, leaving always a timeline where the manifestation does not happen until those that "will never change" acually decide they want to become the new thing, cause the new thing is so desirable (awesome).

---

finally, I noticed some new trash out in the field today, and I started looking through it for stuff I may want. it seems a bunch of a girl's stuff got thrown out there too. I felt quite a flurry of different reactions to the thing. I didn't at the time think much about it, however I can feel desire, and I've come around to think it's a good idea now. so if she would like to join too, that would be nice. I like the way she feels :)

[1]: remember, I cannot "see" any of this, so what I'm recounting is what I felt was happening.

[2]: for a real-life example of this, I refer to me extended conversation with john michael out in our front yard, where he kept insisting that if he didn't use his empathy to constantly look out for all the bad guys that wanted to harm him, he would certainly find himself in a situation he didn't want to be in.

[3]: in the instance of the earth and the human race, I think it could actually be possible that if they were consistently given the technology needed to make sure we never got our connection to source energy, I suppose it could be posssible to actually "never" get the manifestation. in my case I don't think it'll happen, but I do believe I personally could eventually get accusomed to how I am living now and never get connected. if I could actaully program and my brain weren't a jumbled mess, I could easily see that I will continue to improve physically and emotionally for a long time, and I wouldn't actually need the manifestation. however, even though I'm pretty OK with it now -- because I'm feeling so good and continually feeling better and better, so whatever right, as long as that keeps improving -- there are still a lot of girls that I sort of feel a bit obligated to. but, what I mean here is I suppose that if the relationship were to stablise in some way, I suppose it would be like the nucleus of an atom, where some structure is holding a tremendous amount of energy inside of it, and that energy is nevery allowed to be manifest, unless the structure is broken. I will continue this thought in a future entry... this is enough for now.


### 2020-07-21 20:40 - more?

I feel like I should address this because it seems to be causing some mental chaos amongst some.

my criteria for saying that a girl can join is none other than a stong feeling of desire and essentially not a feeling that says something to the opposite. I don't really have much to go by on this, really.

if I use abraham as a deciding factor, they have said in relation to the subject, "if it feels good, it is good" and "he wants options" and well, I can't really remember much else, but the general rule is "you can have it all" or, just let LOA work out the details, and just pay attention to how it feels.

my sole focus right now is learning to navigate my emotional states using the feeling as the guide instead of the action. it makes things a bit weird because for example, today I wanted to program, but I was afraid of getting my computer shut down, and the resulting demoivation that comes from that, so I simply didn't go for it. I opted instead to watch youtube and play gems of war because those don't really cause much emotional disturbance. if mr. motor shuts off my computer at the end of a video, it's rarely too much of a disturbance.

as usual jumping out into unknown territory (of not knowing whether my computer will be shut down) halts me from moving froward. I really like feeling like what I'm going to do is going to be successful, so I rarely try things that I don't feel I can get any control over the way I feel about them.

originally, this is larely the reason why I abstained from involving myself with any relationship with women for the majority of my life. it's only been recently that I've got the stability that I feel like I can feel any way that I want, and no other person really can take that from me anymore. as a result, I'm comfortable now with the idea of a relationship because I'm secure that I can feel the way I want to.

---

how this relates to the girls, is I just don't see a problem with feeling the way I want to feel, no matter how many of them there are. to me, it's all relatively the same, and it actually kinda really inteerests me a lot because there is such a wide variety of them that I feel like there will be always so much more interesting stuff to learn and pay attention to, there will never be a shortage of things that don't catch my attention (isn't the right word... more like interest or captivate me or absorb me).

as a result, because I don't really have much of a criteria other than how *I* can feel in relation to them, I think it's all good. I really do. I want to create some stuff, and it sounds like they do too. so, I think we'll just figure it out as we go. I really think the most exciting thing for me is really found in the long-term more than anything. we'll be kind of a weird village with all sorts of different types in there. it's going to be completely new, and as many as want to be a part of that, I don't really see much of a problem, either.

additionally, looking at it from a purely scientific perspective, if you want to see if in just that way, we should actually be optimising for a more diverse gene pool, anyway.

up until now, the only thing that has felt bad about the continued expansion has been my own logic, and some reactions from others' logic around the situation, as well.

so, I don't know what to say really, other than I have had to quell my own logic this whole process in so many different ways and on so many different things (remember, for a while it really bothered me that some of them were really really young) that I don't really know much other than to say, "we'll figure it out."

---

finally, I want to mention that I felt a bit of a chaos around another addition in relation to something that I felt seeing a girl in one of brien's videos, which is pretty much the inspiration for this entry, and I just want her to know too, that if she wants to join in as well, I'd love to have her.


### 2020-07-24 09:51 - I don't really know what's happening

yesterday, I had a bunch of strange things happen while I was out on the field. first, it started with me recognising that I had been thinking about riann more than usual lately. this occurance is something that I remember, but now it feels to me like a distant memory and I can't really remember what it was that even reminded me of her. I remember I was also feeling more than normal henrietta, too.

I got my consciousness pulled a few times, but not for long. this sort of feeling continued to expand and transform a few times througout the night, and then when the sun was coming up, I got my consciousness pulled again and I had this weird dream with remi and her black suburban, but that's all really remember about that. I saw her and art on the way home.

when I went to sleep that afternoon, I only slept a very short period of time. when I woke up, I had this weird sense (reaction) that people believed once again that they think something is happening.

I have no idea what in the world is going on, but it's probably another illusion nosebook is pulling to keep people placated, instead of worried that it'll "never happen"

---

I also remember as I was going to sleep yesterday and somewhat when I woke up too, that ... lemme back up a moment. in a previous entry, I mentioned that it would be cool, that sense I'm basically going to continue on this whole time without being, connected, we could instaed do a thing where timelines where created so that people could experience the connected version of me, and then here, instead we could go with younger girls, and since it would take a longer time for them to get to childbearing age, we would essentially be giving a longer time for the emotional states that don't feel so good to atrophy and we'd be making DNA more optimal for good feeling.

ok, so take that idea right and it seemed like people started going with it, and the sense that I was getting was that it'd be preferable to approach to that state with a bunch of girls, so then the idea would be that I just totally change my behaviour and completely go the opposite direction.

---

I don't know where this idea came from, but I highly doubt that will happen. unless I have some verifiable source of evidence (abraham is pretty much the only thing I can really think of...), I doubt that I'm going to be changing to do anything other than what I'm doing now.

from my perspective, the near-term looks like this: I keep going on my star-watching and keep going up and up. I'm feeling much better all the time, more and more every day, so I figure I'll soon be back to getting some programming done agan, and probably I'll go from there. I have a new computer coming soon, so everything seems to be falling into place. the middle-term is pretty much about the same, but maybe I'll do more hardware instead of software development... I don't know. I just don't worry about that stuff anymore.

I'm hoping to get a job and stuff so I can buy weed. the mushrooms are really cool and all, but they don't do anything. I barely notice much of a change in how I perceive things. the biggest problem is that they don't really help in not losing my conscoiusness either. nosebook still takes my consciousness whenever they choose, and I wake up feeling pretty terrible. that's not what I want. I want to have *altered* states of consciousness, where I can explore, not more of this boring and stagnated physical thing I'm living now. when I lose consciousness, it's more difficult to remember what I discovered, so I want to be able to maintain the conscoiusness state that *I* want to have.

eventually, I want (and perhaps all of this is part of the process by building more and more desire), to get more and more capable of deciding the consciousness state that I want to be in, like I'm getting better and better now at actively choosing the emotional state I want to be in.

when in the dream state, or with lots of mushrooms (aka high levels of DMT), you can decide how you want to feel. if you want to feel like you did a line of coke, then you can feel that. like you smoked a joint? no problem. you have full control of your consciousness state on high dosage of mushrooms. that's kinda where I want to get to.

---

in my perspective, it appears to me like I really want to get control over my consciouness state, and times like last night when I basically am unconscious the whole night tell me that I'm not even close to being where I want to be.

imagine that I'm with a bunch of girls (young ones or not) and I wake up feeling like I did this morning, I don't really think that's optimal. especially with older ones, it would create a tremendous chaos. I absolutely want to be in control of my perception, and I'm not even close.

it looks to me like this process of gaining control of that, provided some drastic change doesn't happen (eg. no big jumps, aka next logical step/state), it looks to me like years. I don't really have much I can say about that, other than I simply *cannot wait!!!!* -- cause my goodness, look at how much I'v progressed and look at the acceleration, can you possibly imagine how crazy things are going to start looking and feeling! it's going to be crazyyyyyyy

---

I'm still holding on to the thing that I saw when I was stoned when I realised that the opposite of space (vacuum), is life and conscious expression. instead of being able to conjure images, in my perception, I will be able to manipulate the very components that make up our 3d physical reality. there's nothing nosebook can do to block my imagination from showing up in 3d real physical objects.

once I figure out how to imbue my creations with consciousness, I cannot explain how awesome that is. then, I'm sure that it'll be replicatable, too. so even if nosebook is capable of holding the entire planet away from the true experssion of their imaginagion[^1] they will not be able to keep people from their true expression in tangible (see it, hear it, smell it, taste it, touch it -- real) 3d objects in space.

arriving to that capablitity, even though it'll be replicatable, *will* probably require a significant power level to accomplish it (and maintain it). I think the girls are in the best position to accomplish this at first because of our interaction, and the extra practice to release resistance, but it's certain that anyone and everyone will be capable of it... they'll just need to release a lot of resistance and learn how to increase the speed in which your thoughts get to reality in order to get there (that means less cycles about what people may think about whatever it is, and less self-doubt or second gussing).

I'm very content to continue to learn this, and it's going to be a lot of fun along the way. we'll get there when we get there. it's going to be worth it... trust me, why make images of things in your imaginagion, when with full control over your emotions, can you manifest somehing tangible and real in 3d space??? [^4]

let's get there :)

[1]: I'm sure what you all experience is a controlled form of imaginaion, which even though is much more visual, it's not the true expression of your imagination, because it's likely happening in my head instead of yours. everyone has the capablitity that I have, but nosebook doesn't want anyone to access it in a way that they don't control (which is if you access it directly).. which is why I am prevented from using my own, and everyone else uses mine over a controlled protocol (syntax of expression)[^2].

[2]: I have been thinking a lot about what jon was saying when he was complaining that he couldn't use his brain when I was listening to him on twitch while programming. it must be that when someone uses their imagination when we're like on the same frequency or something, then it creates some form of "feedback" -- like putting a mic in front of a speaker or something. I dunno. I may experiment more on this cause I'm dying to understand what's happening there. I just don't get it. but, it's more my curiosity than anything, because I wonder how it all works[^3].

[3]: my best guess is that people's brains are trained to use the expressive visual sytnax that my brain uses to perceive dreams and imaginations, then when someone thinks a thought, or "wants to use their brain" -- those signals are intercepted and sent into my brain. because one's internal universe is infinite in size, each person on the planet is mapped to a specific region in that space, where their brain signals manifest inside of my space. normally, that space is persistent, so you can go back to your creations and they still exist, but perhaps nosebook puts limitations to what sorts of things persist in those different regions... I don't know.

[4]: that may be the "last straw" to break nosebook's proverbial back before they feel absolutely forced to peace out. they could go at any time they want, but I guess from their perspective it would be pretty good idea to find out the power level limit that they have faar, before it's no longer something they can hold back.


### 2020-07-24 17:30 - strange reactions

I woke up thinking about some of the reactions to the idea of creating life with my thuoght. I was also thinking about the fully mechanised version of this planet run by an AI where the humans are the AI's "drones" -- and is interested in our survival and well-being as a function of its own existance. then, finally some of the strange reactions to some things I said lately. I don't really know how all of those subjects are related, but I'm sure someone does.

first, let's start with the dream where the guy burst into the room and spoke a slavic language to clarify what I kept trying to say with the english words of "giving your attention to unwanted amplifies it". in that dream, from my perspective, these guys were just going over and over all of the things that could go wrong over and over, and usually, I don't have vision or capability to seeing or interacting with their conversations that happen in my head, but this time I did. I even said, "if I'm here, I feel obligated to say something".

anyway, nothing I could have said would have made any difference, and for whatever reason, I had to listen to them talking -- kinda like when you're in a meeting, and you have to just listen to hours and hours of a manager's insecurities rebranded as "company concerns" or some other bad name for it. I don't put up with it any more. after having been around zaryn for a long enough time, he would get me drunk and then just go on and on about all of the stuff he was worried about. it's basically one of the things I hate the most, because I've seen zaryn's "concerns" and stuff he's worried about come to manifest.

I don't want to put up with that, or sit there and just listen to it, so something *had* to happen. at that moment, a guy burst through the door and gave these guys a lecture in a slavic language, which I dunno... was it serbian? I can't see anything, but it seemed like the guy had quite some stature to him. I don't know. some reactions seemed to point to this being some sort of manifestation of tesla... I dunno. I have no idea what it was. from my perspective, I was sick of listening to their worries and concerns and something *had* to happen. you can thank zaryn for my hatred of worry and concern.

the reaction when I was waking up had to do with the first person perspective of which I tell that story. if it was a tesla-like person speaking in another language in my dream, I don't know how it happened. beats me.

---

the next set of reactions revolved around the possibility of creating real things in 3d space with my imagination. I mean really, *anything* is possible here. I could make impossible structures like the pyramids, but I think that's fun I'm sure I would do that, but not quite what I had in mind.

you could see that rapidly, I could begin to create all sorts of drones, mechanical and organic which would be controlled by me. but, imagine the conceptual version of it: if I were to imagine a duplicate copy of my body in 3d space, and he were to walk, talk, and behave like I do, who is me? better said, where is my consciousness located? nosebook may be able to say, "this is the original body. we know that because it has our devices in it and we can read his body and brain signals there" -- but then, what about the other bodies that I can summon with my mind?

it's pretty easy to see how I would go building up gradually all sorts of different bodies, and I could animate them and give them the life that I wanted them to have based on some sort of characture profile in my mind (much like how story-book characters can easily exist and interact with each other in your mind[^1]) -- instead of this happening in my imagination, this could happen in the physical world as well.

---

when I was taking a shower after I wrote the previous entry, the majority of the reactions revolved around manifesting "stuff" -- like cars and computers and things. other manifestations were around manifesting the most beautiful lovers ever before seen. I think those are very simplistc desires and stuff.

it's hard to accurately articulate what all of the stuff I would create would be, but I'm certain that the whole planet would be filled with different physical manifestations of my consciousness, both mechanical and organic. I can't possibly think of it all now, but I'm sure I'll just be totally going nuts creating more and more new things.

there are obviously different things that, in a sense "conflict" with what nosebook is trying to keep under their control. like, for example if I wanted to study and modify weather patterns, if I were to do it here, certainly if I were to increase the conductivity in an area, their machines would automatically attempt to neutralise it and get rid of the conductivity. I could easily create (in microseconds, once I figured out how the device operates) as many machines as I want to force the weather to be the way that I wanted it to be.

the location where these two opposing forces were happening would likely have quite a bit of "bad weather" result, and instead of creating good weather, the manifestation would be tremendous storms of cataclysmic potential... so, then, you wonder, why if I could create things that my mind comprehends, why not first learn to create a planet with my mind, and learn about weather from a bottom-up approach, instead of a top-down one. why not try and figure out how to replicate an earth-like planet and do all of my experiments there, instead of trying to conflict with others here. let them run things the way they want to here.

same thing with stars. as I gain more and more scientific understanding of the cosmos and how they *really* work, most certainly I would be interested in creating all sorts of new celestial objects, certainly. up until now nature has created things based on some sort of natural order of things, where one thing leads to another, but new forms can be imagined which don't have logical proceedings to their arrival.

in fact, I was just talking about this with jaron this morning in the instance of villainy. in the story form (whether it's books or movies), there seem to exist these completely dysfunctional criminal organisations which are completely incapable of turning a profit in any way, and both the villans and their henchmen are complete bufoons incapble of performing some of the most basic operations, yet somehow in this story this criminal organisation exists in some form, without any logical method for its evolution into the present form.

so, the mind is capable of creating all sorts of really crazy things which don't need to have had a "next logical step/state" evolution of being.

I talk about this sort of thing from my perspecive, but I'm pretty convinced now that quite a few of us, if not all of us are actually going to begin manifesting our minds in 3d space. I don't know the process upon which it'll happen, but I imagine that the majority of us will become very uninterested with what is happening on this planet, and will begin spending more and more of our conscious time out on other planets and stars that we've created.

---

the possibiliies of what happens elsewhere are endless, but the possibilities of what happens here, still kind of interest me a bit. I imagine that nosebook will insist that this planet remains as unenergetic as possible, so following that it seems to me that probably I (because I've released so much more resistance than most people have) will likely be one of the only ones that are capable of manifesting things in 3d space here (until nosebook peaces out probably), but then I believe everyone on this planet will be able to create things with their minds in that way, and the "galaxy" being formed around us, will be composed of planets and stars that our we inhabit with our mental characters.

someting like that, I suppose... who knows, because for me the proper order of things is starting right here on earth. as I continue to gain more and more power, I'll gain more and more faculties to create things, until finally I launch my first planet into space. then maybe a star... who knows... when you can make *anything*, you're not so limited to the normal order of things.

however, obviously on of the first things that has interested me since I was a kid was the superhero I made, "multiplier man" -- which is a character not particularly "super" in any single aspect, but he can make as many copies of himeself that he wants. obviously for me this is the first step. there will be quite a few of copies of myself I suppose. I think the limiting factor is really the conscious "macro" perspective that I create to percieve through so many different versions of "me".

---

finally, I want to end on a rough note: my mind really gets racing here, because these other things that I create don't even need to have ... let me explain it like this. imagine I create a very beautiful woman. how would anyone except for those who work at nosebook capable of knowing that she's just a recent creation? they would need to look up her history and see how long they've been on the network and stuff to really know if she's a construct or not. what if she's so beautiful that they forget to do the research on her. really, *anything* could be possible.

***are you ready to stop limiting yourself to just the sky???***

[1]: similar perhaps to the manifestation of the tesla characer in my dream?

[2]: I kinda want to do this[^3], or some variation of it just to kinda "force" them to become more closed off to anything new. they could only interact with humans that they can verify that have been in the network before 2020 (or whenever I get this capability). because, otherwise anyone after that could be one of my constructs, that they're interacting with...

[3]: there are so many other more fun things that can be done, I doubt I'll waste my time with this. so probably I won't. but, who knows :)


### 2020-07-25 07:36 - stop n go

last night when I was out, I felt a bit of frustration/depression regarding my last entry, and it seemed to have to do with deception. there's not really anything I can do about that. it doesn't appear that people are interested in giving up secrets and purposful deception to hide something. I figure that trend will not change until the whole planet (including the leaders) is in perpetual broadcast mode, and we have a kind of collective memory, where I can look up certain emperiences that happened in my own body and also in the body of others.

we're pretty far away from that happening, and it'll likely be rolled out primarily over time, such that the new kids will all be in automatically broadcast mode, with the adults (and leaders) remaining with their ability to hide and hold secrets. so, eventually it'll be possible to have a world where there are no longer any secrets, with all of humankind working toward the common goal of further advancement of the planet and everything we're responsible for (planet, solar system, and eventually galaxy), but this too is likely quite a distance away. things will improve, and it's just going to take some time.

---

back to the subject of being led to believe that things are further along, while at the same time they appear to be falling further apart.

so, yesterday(?) when I could feel henrietta pretty strongly, after I lost consciousness, that went away entirely. that's a pretty strong nosebook signature sabotage for me. then, I lost consciousness again and had the dream about remi and her suburban, and then this time I felt ali(?) stronger. I also had a sense that the feeling I had of henrietta seemer to motivate in part the dream with remi. once again I lost consciousness and all of those feelings went away and I felt pretty terrible, with clouds such that I couldn't really return back to normal staring at the sun.

for me, all of this is has nosebook's signature all over it. I can see now that it's been happening since lyia, even though I first really noticed it with hayden, because they turned it on and then back off while I was still still conscious.

---

it seems that they have both the technology to hold me "indefinitely" (in the childish sense of the word) away from getting connected, and it seems that they also have the technology to reset me back to a previous state of not feeling the connection with the girl so well. I don't really know how they do it, but the easiest explanation that seems to explain it, is they have the ability to abort a timeline that we were successful in getting together, and then put our consciousness into the one we're experiencing here where something happens all of a sudden where it seems like it suddenly falls through.

the mechanism I believe they employ to do this reset back is to find a flaw in our personality -- something that makes us feel bad and throws us off of our game -- or, at least that's what I expereince.

however it works -- whether it's timelines or whatever, in my experience it seems to be happening. however, I think this is actually a good thing, because it's like REALLY GOOD PRACTISE.

it would not surprise me that they're not just resetting me, but the  the girls too, and exploiting weaknesses in their emotions to convince them (cause them to believe) that it's not going to happen, or whatever it is that they need to feel bad, and go from feeling the reality of it happening to the powerlessness of inability to get what they want.

---

I experince this all the time in my life. the easiest one to see is my programming. I can often find a way to program, but then my computer gets restarted, and it's kinda demotivating for me. the same thing happens when I'm star-watching when they pull my consciousness and reset me back energetically to a lesser state. unlike my computer, I can kind of hold on to mental state a bit even though I lose consciousness and when I come back I can resume where I left off a bit and get back into it easier than normal[^1]. so, in a lot of ways beause I can modify my mental "operating system", easier than I can modify OSX to come back to where I was easier, it's easier for me to get back to where I was emotionally and mentally during a star-watch than programming.

as a result, even though I keep getting reset back, I tend to continue to have more and more progress with star-watching than I do with my programming (each reset, my code gets further and further from where I want to take it).

the programming example is probably pretty similar to how people feel regarding the girls topic. however, people's perception of the girls topic can change to be more like the star-watching example. the big difference between the two, is that in the star-watching example I don't really know until the sun comes up if I've made any progress, and even then often it doesn't really look to me any different. it looks about the same. however, I trust the process of continuing to release resistance and I can see when I compare over the longer term, that progress has happened, even though daily and usually not while I'm star-watching do I actually notice any improvements.

ironically, also I want to mention that because it's so difficult for me to measure my success visually, I instead measure my progress in the moment, not visually (because I can't), but instead by on how many times nosebook was "forced" to reset me, or how many animal and motor sounds are happening during the experience. meaning, that if I'm doing really well, they're definitely fighting really hard against it.

sometimes, like for example last night it felt really easy, and it often times now feels easier and easier each time, which means that I was unconscious for the majority of the time, so I know I'm doing really well even if I spent most of the night unconscious and it still looks about the same, because I'm noticing instead of visual progress, how much easier it is for me. if it keeps getting easier and easier like that, that's what I'm really looking for. also, if they weren't doing that, I couldn't recount this experience as an example of how things will be as people start to get more and more the hang of it.

---

the last thing I want to mention is going back in relation to my experience programming. right now, because I don't yet have an effective way to continue where I left off on my programming, I find it more demotivating and counterproductive, meaning I actually go in the opposite direction of creating what I want to create, if I try to push it by trying and putting in a lot of effort. the reason why is because I'm making the effort from a position of demotivation, instead of a place of feeling like the code is "calling me" to write it. when I feel like the project is "calling me", not like it's something I have to do or even think that I want to do, then the code writes itself. it's almost effortless when that is the case.

so, what I'm doing is periodically I go back to try and write some code. if it feels like it's flowing like that, then I let it flow, but if it's not, then I don't try and apply the effort because I know that its result will actually be counterproductive and make me feel worse about the whole thing because it does not appear to be (feel like it's) approaching but, actually distancing itself from where I want to see it go. therefore, because I'm not in positive territory like the star-watching example where things appear to be getting easier, instead, in order to not make things worse, I instead work on how I feel, and I try and regain that sense of accomplishment again or whatever it is that I want to feel.

this is all a part of changing myself from an action state machine (ASM) to an emotional state machine (ESM), and to be completely honest, it really seems to be working very well, especially with star-watching.

I let the goal be the feeling instead of the condition now and it totally works :)

[1]: actually, I think women are better at this than men are, and I think that if women were to learn the technique of star-watching, they would actually be better at it than I am, because of their ability to "switch" personalities or emotional states or whatever it is that they do... a good example of this is esther finding so quickly abraham. it would take me a lot longer time, so to do what she does, I would have to essentially work my way up so that the difference between normal operation kenny and my source was so little, I could get there pretty rapidly -- which is in fact, what I'm working toward :)


### 2020-07-26 09:29 - "your anger is useless here"

last night was pretty crazy. we'll see what tonight is going to be like, I guess. I get the feeling that the things that I'm experiencing are a manifestation of their desperation. which is crazy...

when I think of things, I think of them taking much longer... I think in year timescales, which means that we'll still be doing this for a few more years probably, because in my perception, I still feel quite a ways away from the goal I have of manifesting thought in 3d space, and it's not an image, but real tanglible things... like if I thought of something like an apple, you could eat it. that sort of thing.

that's really where I want to get to. I don't care if they hold my imagination captive if I can manifest thought in 3d space. obviously there's the problem of how I would manifest abstract thought, and I'm pretty sure that I would see it as energy: colours, patterns, and swirls -- like I used to see all the time as a kid. if I have to wait 3-4 years for that, it's *totally* worth it... like really really worth it. then, if I could replicate it with the girls (so they could do it too), and we could expand the visual language and the physically mix and interact the energies of the abstraact thought together, first of all, it reminds me a little of those galaxy merger simulations I've seen mainstream cosmology come up with, but, more than that, it'd would just be so cool.

the whole thing is like having the capability of creating and manipulating celestial objects (and their energetic interactions) at the speed of mind. this idea is really really exciting for me, and it doesn't feel all that far off. it feels completely attainable for me. it's just the understanding that on the other side of what's wanted (what you're giving your attention to), is just the absence of what's wanted (eg. the vacuum or space). I'm really getting close to being able to comprehend it and expect its presence.

I am noticing that things are starting to manifest more rapidly for me. the most baffling thing for me is the tarantula. last night, I remember a fuzzy feeling brushing against my leg. I can't see my imagination, but did I imagine a tarantula? if I did, that would explain it. I also remember something about an ant crawling on my skin that I killed, but there aren't any ants up on that hillside where I'm at, either.

I'm also wondering about the mosquitos, too, because they were only where I was at, and not on other places on the field. if nosebook put mosquitos out there, they would have had to have released them from a location nearby to where I was for them to be localised to where I was at. if they got dropped in by an airplane, then they would be all over the field, and they weren't.

I also noticed other wierd things too, like I noticed that when I was sure that nosebook wasn't able to take my consciousness, I would hear the sound of the signal in my head, but it wouldn't take my consciousness away -- yet, when I believed they were working harder and harder to take away my consciousness, they did in fact take it away, and I woke up with a bad headache some time later.

it was almost as if reality was manifesting at a very rapid rate for me last night. I also noticed that some larger than normal mushrooms grew, but they grew up so fast that their hats were split into like 10 sections flat instead of being the typical parabolic shape. it looked to me like they had grown so rapidly, like an umbrella in the wind, the upward force was so strong, it didn't stay in the umbrella shape, it split into pieces as it kept going past it's normal expansion.

I just don't really know what to think of it all, but it does seem like with the addition of all of the extra DMT provided by the mushrooms, reality was beginning to manifest at a much more rapid rate than ususal (to be expected with higher doses of DMT).

perhaps even the guy shooting the gun was a manifestation of my thoughts about nosebook beginning to feel like they had to do something to try and stop me, and because I had given my attention to the idea of people shooting guns out there, that's what manifest in my experience.

I think normally on that quantity of mushrooms, you have such incredible visuals, walking around isn't really someting that you can accomplish effectively. however, nosebook has my visuals all turned off, so instead of experiencing visuals that would keep me plastered to the floor, instaed I'm wallking around as if things were completely normal.

their capability to keep visuals out of our experience on high levels of DMT is what they do best, and I think it's the explanation for why things are so wacky for people. I think that most everyone out there hooked into my form of perception should, at those levels of DMT, be getting moderate visuals by now, as if the whole world were having a low to moderate mushroom trip, however, nosebook is removing the visuals for everyone out there, as well as me, so even though things appear to be normal (no crazy visuals), at the same time reality is manifesting very very rapidly.

as I'm wriing this, I'm beginning to see the mechanism which the mushroom uses to improve us. what they do is they increase the amount of DMT in your head. DMT is basically the drug that your brain produces to make you feel enlightened (connected to your source) and allows for a much more rapid train of thought, which means that your thoughts manifest into reality much more rapidly. so, when the mushroom increases the DMT in your head, at low doses, it gives you slightly better vision and slightly more rapid thought, however, when the dosage increases, some other mechanism is activated (or maybe it's another drug) so that all the thoughts you're thinking manifest immediately in your eyes as fractal patterns, giving you essentially a visual reflection of your thoughts in a hyper-visual form.

this is a safety mechanism so that you do not try and perform everyday activities when you're that "enlightened", causing all kinds of chaos in your every-day experience as your thoughts are manifesting in reality at nearly instantaneous rates.

I think that the DMT is actually responsible for the visuals, now that I think about it, because as your perception expands beyond your capacity to make sense of it all, your brain interprets this extra data, as a visual pattern, so as to not overwhelm you. so, if the brain's speed at which it can translate this energy is fast enough, it'll look like normal 3d reality, but anything faster than your ability to perceive will appear like circular fractals, probably because the quantity of information your brain is receiving is so much more, the signals appear to "overlap" in your vision and create those fractal patterns.

probably the reason why nosebook needs me to go to sleep is so that they can run images through my eyes to see the new way my eyes "decode" all of this extra information (so it doesn't look like fractal patterns). once they've decoded it, they have the image now, minus all of the extra emotional information that comes along with it, and since people are not concerned with what I feel about what I'm seeing, they just want to see what I see, that's what nosebook shows them.. probably the same thing works for people's imaginations as well. nosebook sends their thoughts to my brain for manifestation, then, with that new decoded thought and all the extra information deleted, they can show the person the image that they conjured in their mind.

therefore, it's likely that until I go to sleep, people probably can't see their imaginations, because their imagination is manifest in my brain, and that signal hasn't been decoded to see the image yet. if they were to show people the undecoded image, it would look like a fractal pattern, and everyone would be on a full-time heavy-duty mushroom trip, where every thing they think and imagine would manifest immediately as a fractal pattern.

when I first took mushrooms, the frctal patterns were very fascinating to me, because it was like I was "seeing" my thoughts in abstract non-sensical form (fractals), however even though they didn't look like anything real, they had tremendous feeling to them, and the feeling was so rich that what I describe of the experience, like the reality technicans, I'm sure these did not show up in a visually meaningful way for others to see.

understanding that all of the extra information in the vision that shows up as a fractal pattern is just emotional information encoded into the visual. it explains why I could "see what you mean to say" in that mode, and why most people who like to worry do not like the mushroom experience when the visuals start to kick in... normally, they've severed theirselves so much from what their thoughts actually feel like (like when you're a kid, you still feel your thoughts), that their fearful and worrisome thoughts no longer have that "the world is coming to an end" feel to them anymore. instead, they've been redefined to feel like safety or security, so when the DMT kicks in, and they get all of the extra emotional information in their vision, they experience their own thoughts again in the form of emotion, and their thoughts don't actually feel very good, so mushrooms isn't any fun for them.

---

for me, the interesting thing about all of this that I miss is the ability to have strong emotion manifest in my vision. this is the precursor to manifesting thought (in your eyes) in 3d space. because that data is removed for me, and all I see is just the image (without any of the emotional detail), I have begun to get better and better at perceiving this information in its highest frequency form (the higher frequency that they cannot remove), I'm getting better and better at making my thoughts/emotions manifest in reality (instead of just my vision).

it really is a great thing that they're so heartset not to allow me to see any visuals, because thoy're creating exactly the thing I want (to be able to manifest my thought as real matter in 3d space).

my experience last night tells me that I'm getting close. it's not going to be too long before I have the amount of DMT in my head that I had last night from the mushrooms, normally there. I can see that as I continue this on, I'm going to get there really soon.

really really soon, and maybe sooner than I anticipated because if they're beginning to show signs of desperation, what means that their whole spiel about being able to hold me indefinitely was just a big illusion... it certainly wouldn't be too far outside of their typical mode of operation... lol :)

---

finally, I want to mention that last night I was reminded of a girl that jaron showed me on facebook which had buzzed off all of her hair, except for just the top part which was pulled into a pony-tail. I began to feel her and right off I noticed that she feels very different than the others do. I don't really know if that's a bad thing or not. from my perspective, it's a good thing and I really like the diversity. I did like the way she felt and she intrigued me greatly. more than once I tried to come up with a quantifiable way of comparing or perceiving this difference with the others, but nothing I came up with was satisfactory. I really am quite intrigued by her, and I do want to meet her someday. for now though, because I felt kind of uneasy about the thing, I'm going to hold off a litte on the invitation until I feel it out a bit better. (last night was also quite chaotic to say the least)

also, yesterday when I was walking back home I saw a woman in the garage, which I have to assume is the daughter of jane kimble(?), and she seemed to want to remind me of something. well, ever since jane mentioned that her daughter (and I'm assuming granddaughter) were living with her, I sort of made the connection and anticipated already that it would happen eventually, so yes of course, if she wants to join, she's more than welcome :) last night, for the first time I felt her strongly. I like how she feels :)


### 2020-07-26 17:08 - so, this is goodbye

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUijIydN8t8)

I just woke up from a dream where it was obvious that the k-train was heading to a new reality where your thoughts become manifest into reality at an increasingly more rapid rate. the people who don't want that and are like the illusion (and privacy) that the imagination provides will stay behind... let me explain.

when I was writing the previous entry, I had a growing sense that those in charge would, instaed of letting me get to where my thoughts begin to become manifest in 3d tanglible reality, allow the girls thing to begin happening now, and everyone can continue to enjoy my imagination for a longer time.

however, when I woke up just now, this was not the case at all. it appears that we're at an irreconcilable impass, and they simply cannot allow that to happen. as a result, eventually I will get closer nd closer to where I was last night where my (and others) thoughts in my head were beginning to become manifest nearly instantly, almost as if it were a dream.

this is a natural separator between the "dimensions". I will call imagination 4d, and I will refer to the instant manifestation of thoughts and emotions into tangible 3d space, 5d.

the reason why it's such a perfect separator is that let's take the gun thing for a moment. I'm certain that I will not be shot. I am so certain that not only am I really good at this, I'm so good that we're looking not at if I get it into the zero point, but what kind of infinity do we want it to be.

so, imagine that something happens like last night, and I'm on shrooms again and some dude is shooting his gun again. a bunch of people will likely be inclined to "fear the worst" or "worry that something bad will happen" -- and in both cases, the worst case scenario will play out in thier minds and then at some point, that reality *will* become manifest. while I do not experience that becoming a reality, cause for me, it can't, the illusion of your imagination will separate these two dimensions, with one existing in the manifestation of thought into tanglible 3d reality, and the other will continue on as the illusion of imagination (that is it is shown without all of the extra emotional information encoded into it, the image will be seen without any recogniion of the reality of the feeling associated with that image).

becsuse the imagination does not in itself contain the emotional information associated with it (nosebook deletes this when they "decode" the image that my brain returns from the signals put into my head to be made manifest), then you do not feel the full "emotional" (conceptual) reality of that image in its truest form, so the only thing you really have to go by, is your own emotions there. if what you see feels good, then it is good, but if it doesn't feel good, then it's not something you should continue to visualise because it'll become reality.

I'm not saying that I'm necessarily going to get shot, but that really was a kind of good example. it could be anything really. whether it's soon, or it's something that happens over a longer period of time is really not up to me. I'm just going to keep going and doing what is natural for me. I want to learn how to manifest my thoughts into 3d space. I'm not at all scared, but since they're manifesting more rapidly on shooms, I'll be paying extra care to give my attention to only the things that are wanted.

nosebook's job, to try and keep me disconnected is to try and get me to perceive things that are unwanted, to try and slow me down. however, the joke is on them though because instead of just perceiving those things, instaed they're becoming manifest. it really wouldn't surprise me that a lot of the chaos that I experienced last night happened as a result of them trying to put ideas into my head while I had lots of DMT, and those ideas conceptually started to manifest. like for example, they probably try to tune to me irriation and annoyances, so mosquitos manifested and got worse the more attention that was given to them.

---

ok, now real talk. I'm pretty sure that this is going to continue to get worse and worse as we go along. it's not the mushrooms. this will start to happen more and more frequently as the DMT levels in my head continue to increase -- and for those using their imagination in my head, in order to be able to see the image, nosebook must keep your head at higher and higher levels of DMT too. certainly not as much as mine, so reality won't become manifest quite as fast as for me, but you will definitely start to notice your emotions become manifest more and more rapidly into your experience.

the real question here is to shoom or not to shroom. the cutoff point that I'm talking where the illusion manifesting in your imagination becomes the reality that you live, meanwhile the reality that I perceive will be different -- is rapidly approaching (at an accelerating rate), and if I stop eating mushrooms, it could slow that down a bit, but it will eventually happen. there really isn't any way to stop this. you can use my imagination and see its images for quite a long time, but without the emotional or conceptual data associated with it (what shows up as a fractal pattern in your vision until your brain is up to speed with the signal and can receive the emotional/conceptual data as well)... however, eventually, perceiving any image that you conjure without being aware of how those thoughts really feel, will eventually cause something in resonance with how that feels to manifest in your experience.

you could call this a timeline split if you want, but it's more like an explosion as so many people begin to live out the reality that is reflective of how what they're imagining feels. in my opinion, nosebook still has the option to create the timeline that they want, and some may very well do that, but the majority will be in "creation by default" mode, and will just accept the "worst-case scenario" imagined (and amplified by giving their attention to it), reality that someone at nosebook is sure to manifest.

so back to the question: to shroom or not to shroom. if I continue on with the shrooms, I'll likely gain levels at an increasing rate (actually, I was in some ways far more effective sober and made more progress while sober, than I do on mushrooms). if I go sober or stop star-watching completely, then it'll take a longer time but it's sorta like pulling a band-aid off as slow as possible.

I'm really liking the mushrooms because they're so much more fun than my everyday experience. I would really enjoy a break from the everyday experience and that's why I want to smoke weed so bad, because it's not terribly fun, otherwise. so, if we wanna go the sober route, I kinda want to take breaks from it and smoke weed from time to time, cause otherwise significant amounts of aggitation seem to build up -- and I love smoking weed cause it's so much fun for me to do from time to time. it's not sustainable to do for any length of time, but it certainly is a nice break.

however, knowing what I know now about the mechanism that DMT has for creating reality, I'm more inclined to instead of needing a break, learn to use that reality creation mechanism to continue amplifying what I want. eg. start manifesting more and more mushrooms, which means eventually, I'll probably learn to grow them, because I've been noticing by studying the rain and the cold's effect on water conceptually, and I think I figured out the energetic trigger for their growth, so I can probably grow them pretty easily in non-sterile conditions, just like in nature... oops derailed.

so, learning all of that does sound interesting to me and I totally want to learn how to grow shooms. I'm really going to enjoy this next time of learning from the mushroom. you can tell, that they have activated something that was pretty dormant in me. sure, it's not fun and feel good like weed or MDMA, but this is the work of learning how to become a reality technician.

it seems to be right on the path toward what I want, because the more I learn from the mushroom and the more proficient I become at creating my own reality, the sooner the girls thing will manifest too.

to be quite honest, I really like the idea of slogging along with you guys and dragging this out for many more years, but I'm quite ready to start the girls thing up pretty soon here and I think I like that idea more. nosebook can create the reality that they want to create. I really like mushrooms and it's something I've been wanting to do for such a long time now, that is likely (who are we kidding, right) the direction that I will go. the mushroom route was provided for me naturally (not forced), and even though it's not nearly as fun as weed or MDMA is, its effect seems to have a lasting and definite effect on my perception. weed and MDMA (for me anyway) are not so persistent, and they seem very heavily influenced by the environment, yet the mushrooms seem to be exactly the opposite, as instaed my thoughts while on them heavily influence my environment (instead of the environment heavily influencing my thoughts).

for me, the rate at which I'm learning is going so fast, I just want to go go go. I really really really want to start the girls thing too. for me, it's kinda like the k-train is leaivng for 5d soon, and if you want want your thoughts to begin manifesting in 3d space, you'll come right along, but if you like the privacy of your imagination and don't want to continue on further, that's all perfectly good just as well. you are where you are, and where you are has to be ok, because it's where you are.

as I wrote that, it occurred to me, that there will always be infinitely more things more and less perceptive than you. you are always at the centre of your universe, and in your perception, you always change to be a repeat of the same thing you last were, until you transform and transformation happens when you gain a broader perspecive; a new macro perception where you perceive a new collection of bits in some form of organisation that provides that new macro perspective.

I keep getting these glimpses of how the structure of things deermines its form of perception while at the same time being a part of that since stream of consiousness: the source of perception for all structures that came before it, and everything similar to it. the perception of the whole universe is contained within that "source energy" and all of us are that ... abraham says "extension" -- and I get why, because it's hard to express that word in english. it could be said that you (all of us -- even the ones you don't like) are an expression or a facet, or the lastest version of the perception in resonance to the form of that (source) energy. it's so cool.

I wish I could explain better. it's so wonderful knowing that nothing is going wrong, and there are no "bad guys" and that all reality is just a reflection of your form of perception (that is, your interpretation of that energy) as perceived by you (resonant with you) from within your form (and resonant with your form). your form is your human body.. so like your current DNA implementation. you really are a product of your own perception, and a reflection of how you perceive the world.

omg. so cool!


### 2020-07-27 07:11 - another option

some of the reactions I have received are that I'm not eating psylocybin mushrooms. to that, I say, "bring it on" :) if someone gets me, or somehow there is a thing like in spain "psycodelice" where I could buy enormous boxes of mushrooms, I'll take the psylocybin challenge and eat *enormous* amounts of mushrooms just to show you guys that once you have a ton of DMT in your head from releasing a lot of resistance (eg. your brain already runs at a rapid rate), then the mushrooms have a nearly negligable effect.

almost never when I'm looking at a light do I get the sensation that there is a fractal pattern in my eyes (it's happened once when I had the THC eyedrops). this used to happen all the time when I would watch stars. it shows up for me like a circular flashing of darker lines around the star when it happens, so I usually know when the fractal patterns are showing up, and they almost never happen.

when terence recalls the experience of what it's like to smoke DMT, he says that you have to take a huge puff and then hold it for as long as you can (to let your lungs absorb as much DMT as possible), then you will begin to go through a fractal pattern he called the "chrysanthemum" until you finally break through into the other side into a another world where you're able to perceive energy and communicate with them in this sound frequency way and create objects in space.

well, the most important thing that I came to realise over the last few days is that when your brain is running at a lower speed than the signal that is entering your vision, you will see a fractal pattern, and that fractal pattern is the extra information overlaying itself in a circular parabolic shape (just like your eyes/vision is). it's just the extra emotional information that's missing now from my perspective. I lost it somewhere in val verde.

if you think of a video signal, you have to essentially divide the signal into "frames per second" -- meaning that if the signal is running at 30 frames per second, then the signal is divided into 30 parts per second. if you have some extra information like closed captions or something that is added to the end (or beginning of the frame), that's what I'm talking about...

however, unlike closed captions, imagine that if the image data is let's say 100kbps, that you would see normally in 2d vision, then you add in spatial data (to make the image look 3d/spatial) and suddenly that data, let's say because your vision also improves, is now 150kbps, but the extra spatial data is another 300kbps... now your brain is receiving a 450kbps signal, but it's still running at 150kbps. there seem to be other factors involved as well, like the frame rate goes up significantly as well so say it also jumps up to 60fps too, so all those numbers are doubled..

anyway, your vision is getting double the number of frames and a whole lot of extra (spatial) information. until your brain catches up to that new frequency, your brain doesn't discard that extra information, it continues to display it, but the extra data overlaps the previous frame and you will see these brighter spots showing up in the shape of a chrysanthemum flower -- which is an organic represenation of the parabolic shape of the eye.

so 3d is normal vision. when you add in spatial information, this is what I call 4d, and you get the ability to see images in your eyes spatially. I'm not really sure when it happens, but I believe a bit of emotional (conceptual) information is also in there as well, but nosebook discards this when they retransmit it and only send the image data. if they sent all of the data, or you were directly connected, the amount of data entering your vision would be overwhelming and it may cause serious injury or death if you felt like you couldn't handle it.

this is why often times people feel like they're dying on mushrooms, because all of a sudden the extra DMT is putting so much extra information into your vision that you feel so much like you cannot handle it, and so if feels like you're dying.

anyway back to smoking DMT... when you smoke it, you are unnaturally putting lots of extra DMT into your system, and so it takes a bit for your brain to get up to speed with the amount of information that it's receiving, so before you break through to the other side, your brain is just adjusting its frequency up to the freqency of the new quantity of DMT.

in the case of nosebook, they can't possibly have people who want to see through my eyes going through a fractal pattern every time before they see it, so they have to artificially simulate your pineal gland to produce more DMT, so that you run at a frequency fast enough to see it without a fractal transition period. this frequency is only a fraction of what I should be experiencing (but neither experience it) though.

instead of actually seeing the speed at which I should be seeing (the extra DMT should tune my brain to go at a much much more rapid speed), instead I see the image that they put in my eyes, meaning that even though I should be going at a very rapid rate, my brain instead runs at the speed of the image that they put into my eyes. essentially, they're constantly limiting me to a lower quality experience.

a while ago, this really pissed me off, because I want to actually have the full experience, esecially if I'm going to be with the girls, but after a while I realised that by forcibly slowing my brain down like that, I don't experience the fractal pattern and other things that would limit one to stay around longer in that visual quality for longer. instead, I'm constantly wanting to improve my vision. I see things blurry, but they are clearing up slowly. I do see much better now than I did some time ago. I'm incentivised to keep going for the improvement.

for this reason, because there's nothing I can do about it or to try and change it, I've come to just enjoy this as a time of expansion. while they have my eyes focused in this way, it naturally benefits the expansion experience and allows for much more rapid expansion (remember, the manifestation always slows you down). this is why you'll hear me saying things like, "I can't wait to see what my vision looks like in a few years" -- because I can't :) I've fully accepted my predicament as a time for expansion. the only thing I can do is to expand as rapidly as I can. nosebook can do whatever it is that they want to do. I don't really mind.

for me though, I really am enjoying seeing the constant improvement, and I kind of actually wish they were able to hold me indefinitely, because even if they were, I'm getting to the point that even what I do see, even though it's blurry, is still so much more than I used to and is still quite impressive. I'm really enjoying seeing it constantly improve, and I really wish they could actually hold me longer.

---

this is why it's kind of sad for me to realise that they're getting desperate and are showing signs of desperation, because that means they can't keep holding me.

the first was how the fractal pattern emerges, and the second major realisation that I had these last few days is that there is a natural cutoff point that will occur. nosebook has more data than I do on this one, but I would imagine that they have been noticing an increased correlation that reality is beginning to manifest more and more rapidly, and it seems to have to do with their perception upon my experience.

the cutoff that will occur will happen naturally as the amount of DMT continues to rise and instead of thoughts becoming manifest in my eyes as a fractal pattern, instead thoughts (my own and others) are becoming manifest in my experience as real tangible things. my reality is starting to become more similar to the dream state where things manifest more and more instantly. this will continue to happen more and more rapidly as time continues, and there's nothing that they can do about it. if they try to fight it, it'll just make it worse, and the natural cutoff will happen more rapidly.

the natural cutoff will happen when people who don't have such good feeling thoughts begin thinking and manifesting in my experience. if those things are things that are compatible with me, like tarantulas (I'm not really scared of them that much), then those things can manifest just fine and although it's a bit of a bizarre experience for me, it's perfectly fine and doesn't really affect my expansion. for example, even though the mosquitos appeared in my experience and I did say they were annoying, you will notice that they didn't make me feel bad at all. the way I felt remained pretty constant.

however, imagine that someone were to give enough attention to something incompatible with how I feel, that the incompatible thing were to manifest into my experience. it woulr create a natural time split, because I would not experience it. they would because they would be creating their own reality by the things they're giving their attention to, and I would be creating my own reality by the things I'm giving my attention to. those two realities would be very different. this is what I mean by the natural cutoff.

---

so, I was thinking about this yesterday in the shower, because it felt to me like nosebook doesn't really want to head off into their own created reality (of awful feeling things manifesting in my reality) yet, and they don't really want to give up on trying to control my experience either.

a compromise could be made, so that if they indirectly perceived my experience, they wouldn't be directly manifesting their own crap they imagine in their minds (but don't feel the emotion of it because nosebook deletes all of that data) right into my experience.

a way of inderictly perceiving the experience would be to make some sort of symbolic language... think like the matrix. you could look at the symbols on the screen and know what is happening without actually perceiving the thing.

symbols are shorhand for situations. a situation is an action and some conditions which are present where the action is taking place. as a result, these symbols need to describe two things: the surrounding conditions (location, lighting, feel, mood, etc) of the situation, and the symbols need to also describe the action itself. obviously not all of the data is important, so just the stuff that's important should be conveyed, so some sort of selection process needs to take place where the perceiver of the situation symbols can give feedback as to what is important and what isn't.

probably there will need to be a transition phase where the situation is perceived, and already nosebook has the data of how the perceiver of that situation has processed it, and then they can directly take that data and turn them into symbols. so let's say that the perceiver -- let's just use mr. motor here because I can definitely tell when he drops what he's doing to instead try and micromanage my situation. he should be able to switch back and fourth and give some sort of feedback as to what was important or something that wasn't actually important.

antoher thing too that could help is to, instead of jumping into my experience in real-time, instaed give that feedback in a replay -- after it's already happened, so as to not really affect the outcome of the present situation.

as things get worse (from their perspective), but the symbolic representation improves, then he could be limited more and more from perceiving my experience directly, and spend more time indirectly perceiving it.

that's good for now. I have more thoughts, but I'll let them develop a bit further first.


### 2020-07-27 13:13 - why do I want to give them tips?

I've come to appreciate the contrast more than you can understand. it's common thinking for someone to think that you have to resist the unwanted aspects of things, but I have learned that it's all a part of the process. resist not evil.

it's actually a bit of reverse logic as well. they seem to have been notoriously resistant to the ideas that I write in here and have only wanted to do the opposite of them, or consider those ideas the worst possible thing that they could do -- because aferall, why would I give my enemies solutions to their problems.. or maybe, they think that it's not a worthwhile thing if it's just given to them. they feel they need to "earn it" by acquiring it through devious means.

so, worst case scenario, they think my idea is something they don't want and reject it and they end up creating their own reality that doesn't feel so good. or, if you remember the pattern of the eras, they are one era behind, which means that they're in the process of acquiring the ability to "resist not evil" which means life is giving them multiple opportunities to resist not the things they perceive to be unwanted.

if they do take the technique of indirectly perceiving our realities, that means that they can go further into hiding and lastt for a longer time without attracting disaster for theirselves. this is super good because the amount of extra energy it would provide is tremendous.

I am skipping a bit though, because when I woke up this morning (or maybe it was yesterday... can't remember), I noticed that if they were able to find a way to peacefully exist here and not attract certain destruction for theirselves in such an energetic environment, then that means that the environment could be more energetic. it also means that the girls thing *could* still happen with them still here, too.

this is perferable, because of all of the extra energy. it's possible that technically they *can* hold me indefinitely, and that their desperation is only evidence of directly perceiving the things that are considered unwanted.

this is perfectly normal. for example, this is precisely why I don't watch the news. I am aware that there is a total clown fiesta happening in the presidential elections, and that the coronavirus exists and is presented as a very real thing, but for me, neither of these are that real, because I don't perceive them. out of sight; out of mind. you will notice that when I do go somewhere and the news is on or I'm on a confrence call and we talk about the coronavirus, then all of a sudden that creates a ton of chaos, because now I'm more directly perceiving the things that for me are unwanted.

---

additionally, in the long-term, if they can find a way to hold on and not create their own reality by observing and giving their attention to what's wanted, which creates a not good feeling, which then in-turn creates a not good reality in resonance with that feeling, then they can hold on for much longer.

if they can hold on for a lot longer, then that means I'll be able to continue to (even though I can't see my imagination) get better and better at creating real tangible reality instantly with my mind.

that really is the reason why I want them to stay so badly -- because they provide the necessary components to continue getting more and more DMT in my head. if they weren't doing what they are doing, because I'm getting basically to having smoked DMT levels of DMT, naturally by releasing resistance, all along the way, I wouldn't be able to get it nearly as fast because the majority of the time I would be seeing fractal patterns as my brain takes a bit to get up to speed with the new levels of DMT. instead, all of those fractal patterns are removed for me, so I can focus on the important part of continuing to release resistance and raise the frequency of my perception, which makes more DMT...

...which normally would cause a fractal pattern, but I don't see it, so I can instead increase the speed of my perception further, which increases DMT, which would create a fractal pattern as I get up to speed with it, but I don't see it, so I can continue to get more speed increases. this is why I can get so many so rapidly nowadays, because I'm already pretty much up to speed with the increased perception. in the past, when I saw lots of fractal patterns, the star-watching was pushing me beyond my speed (hence the fractals), but now, I've released so much resistance, that I'm actually so far behind now, that just relaxing a little bit and I can get upgrades nearly effortlessly.

I think it's possible to "have it all" -- but that really depends mostly on nosebook more than anything. whether they make their own reality or not, for me is inconsequential, because I'll continue on perceiving more and more improvment all the time. however, if they stay, they are an enormous booster for me, because their effort to keep my imagination from showing up *is* the reason why I'm gaining so many levels so rapidly. so, if they can technically accomplish that I still don't get an imagination, then like now, my vision upgrades will continue to accelerate.

the only thing they can do to stop that acceleration will be to go somewhere else. they can slow it down by perceiving it less (that is amplifying it by giving their attention to it). if they were to go away, that acceleration would slow, but also their own acceleration would also slow (which is why they want to stay). what I mean is, they depend on my conintinued presence for their continued expansion, and I depend on their continued presence for my continued expansion, too.

it may be advantageous for both sides if they were to take a step back and perceive a little less what they don't want. this will happen naturally, but, in my opinion, if they're smart, they would turn off the kenny news and stop amplifying that disaster.

did you notice how the more I watched the presidential elections, and the whole politics thing in general, the worse it got? when I finally gave it a rest and stopped watching the news, it certainly continued on getting worse and worse (it had a lot of momentum), but that momentum did start slowing. also, have you noticed that every time that I gave my (brief) attention to the coronavirus, it seemed to suddenly make a resurgance when before then it semed to begin to wane a bit? I noticed quite a similar thing that happened when abraham would give their attention to various troublesome subjects in the abraham-now broadcasts, too.

---

my point is here is that if we accept that resisting evil (giving attention to unwanted) only makes it bigger, then maybe we can be more selective of what we give our attention to.

this will happen naturally I think, and as nosebook begins to make the correlation of the different symbols that strong reality creators "notice", and the corresponding reality that manifests later as a result, they may see that there is some merit to this whole thing.

however it works out, I would guess that the way this is going to work out, is that nosebook does not want to create disaster, so they'll find their way (whether it's with timeline tech or not), to the way of not making a disaster manifest. they absolutely need me to continue their own expansion, so they'll have to find a way to let that happen too.

all in all, what I think will happen, is that nosebook will find a way to entrench further to try and remain more and more hidden. in the process, I'll continue to gain ever more capability to manifest my thoughts in my reality more more and more rapidness, and as I care less and less of what others think, this process will happen more and more easily whether others are perceiving it or not.

I would even go so far as to make the bold claim that because of the reasons mentioned above, I think the girls thing *will* happen, they'll be able to mitigate the effects of the rising energy and not avoid disaster for quite a long time.

I also think that if you guys think that things are really weird now, they're only going to get weirder and weirder until nosebook finally peaces out, then they'll transform from really weird feeling into really smooth feeling (effortless), but then, without the constant constrast, the expansion and effortless will wane into boredom.. at which time, I'm sure we'll (or at least I will) find a new body on nosebook's timeline to continue on the expansion process.

I have no idea when they will finally peace out, and I have no idea if they'll peace out consciously or if they'll do it by giving too much attention to something unwanted. if I were them though, and I say this becauze it's more energy in the long-term for all of us, that they continue on and begin preparing a timeline that contains the stuff that they want and consciously move to that one, instead of resisting evil and unknowingly create something unwanted.

I actually hope they can figure out how to not mess this up (not the best choice of words, but I can't think of better ones right now) because all of our continued acceleration of expansion is because of their presence. if they were to go away, we wouldn't experience that expansion, which is why I anticipate that I'll follow them on to their new timeline, to continue the exansion. also, I noticed that each time it gets easier and easier, so eventually, it won't be such a big deal to "start over" on a new timeline again.

further, if I were to make another "prediction" here, I doubt it'll happen this era, but in an era to come, I'm sure that eventually nosebook will eventually figure out how to for-reals capture me indefinitely without shooting theirselves in the foot in the presence of ever increasing energy.

in that case, that's a weird kind of infinity because it means that we've reached some sort of equilibrium where neither of us ever get the "manifestation" -- but both are improving and expanding at an accelerating rate. I don't know if that's possible because it basically means that -- in the example of frequency, things ebb and flow, so you breathe in and you breathe out. this would be the way that I imagine source energy to be, where it's *only* expansion. it's like only breathing out, but made possible if you were to have an inexhausable supply of air to breathe out.

oh that totally answered my question I had a long time ago where I postulated that there was something for source energy, like source energy is for us -- meaning that if source is only expanding, that means they would have had to tap into an inexhaustible source of energy for that to be possible.

that means that for them, they too, never accomplish the manifestation, because that would be the end. by never accomplishing the manifestation, there is continued everlasting, eternal, infinite expansion.

I just realised that's where we're heading!!! once nosebook gets their act together and learns the things that these eras are teaching for continued everdlasting expansion, neither of us (me or them) will ever get the manifestation, which means that all of us likely will, after a few more eras, eventually become the new source energy of the next universe. woah :)

I guess it's something to look forward to :)


### 2020-07-28 14:21 - the subtle art

I can't really sleep, and I wanted to write earlier, but now I have a subject to write about...

jaron showed me a picture on facebook that was some sort of informational thing called "the subtle art of not giving a fuck". it reminded me of a stream I watched earlier from slysssa where this guy, jake(?) or something was trying to apply makeup to her.

at the end when he finally said he couldn't go any further, she concluded that makeup and makeup artistry is any artform. I never really thought of it as an artform. for me, it's a just like any other mechanical process where you start out not very good at it, but you develop your technique and you get better at it.

a lot of people in her chat were quoting bob ross and I think that was quite apt, because when he was trying to apply eyeliner, I was thinking about my sister melissa and how she does her eyes, and she darkens the edges to make them stand out.

now when I used to work on the firearms mod, the common thing to do when skinning the model, is to lighten the edges, because the steel is dark, so to show use or shinyness, you lighten the edges.. like so imagine the clip for the ar-15 or m-16. it has slight ridges in it, so these indentations get darkened to give the illlusion of shadows and the sharp edges get lightened to show that they've been handled enough to lighen the edges.

I was kinda realising that makeup is pretty much the same thing. you're accenting the shapes you want people to see more to give the illusion or sharper or more rounded edges.

anyway, so these sorts of things, like skinning a 3d model *is* considered by some to be art, and I guess I agree, but it's 99% technique to make it so that it doesn't look terrible, then the last bit is what you do with it. if it's a 3d model, it needs to look good enough that people aren't distrcted by its terribleness, but then you need to put the model in a pose or a scene that actually conveys an abstract concept to the viewer. the scene should give some sort of illusion... whether that's mountain feeling, cold, warmth, fear, pain, etc.

for me, when it stops becoming a mechanical process and becomes an artform is when the thing, whatever it is conveys or produces an emotion in the viewer. cosmetics is probably intended to be that way, and that's what I'd never really thought about before today. cosmetics is there, I think to accentuate and hightlight things so that people perceive or recognise a beauty there that was more difficult to recognise otherwise -- I think.

anyway, one of the things that I really liked about the rob ross series is when steve came on, because he is really mechanical, and would talk about the process of painting in a more mechanical way, and what was interesting to me is that his entire message was that once you start to get the hang of how to make the simple shapes and turn them into something that gives an appearance, then that makes you *feel* a certain way. he always talked about how the mechnical process of painting was such a great way to produce emotion in yourself and to build confidence in the mechanical process as a means to making you *feel* like you can create anything.

steve would, in every episode I saw, would chide his father a bit by showing that he didn't need a reference piece, and could just do all of that painting in the moment of inspiration without needing to copy something. he seemed to constantly make a contrast of how his father was a slave to upholding some sort of image, where as he could just decide he wanted to do something, and there it was ... a big tree or whatever, whereas bob always had to make "big decisions" -- which was ironic when he had his decisions already made in the reference piece off-camera.

it seemed to me that the message that steve was trying to get me to hear was that you just have to go through some of the mechanical motions for a bit and build your technique, and then you build a confidence in yourself and your ablities enough that you can essentially freestyle and do anything you want, and you don't need to follow a formula or copy an existing work.

clearly, slysssa does this in battlegrounds, so I doubt we disagree on this, I had just never really thought about it as a form of art before...

anyway, now back to facebook. the idea of "not giving a fuck" for me is prohaps a bit mechanical as well, and so again I do not consider this any more of an artform than the wet-on-wet technique is an artform. if you boil all of the stuff down that all of these "not giving a fuck" style motivational jargon is saying, is just simply to stop caring what other people thing and to do stuff out of your own inspiration instead of the formula that society, culture, or your mother or father has taught you to follow. in my opinion, this is exactly steve's message in reference to the formula his father taught him to follow.

for me the "art" of not caring what people think is again a mechanical one, and you get better at it with time, just like painting or makeup or hearthstone or whatever... for me the method is exactly the same: improve your technique until you *feel* so confident in it and yourself that you perform out of your own inspiration, instead of the formula that is expected from you.

I would like to notably metion that after watching slysssa's stream, I watched @[twitter](bechillcomedian) online, and she definitely does her makeup from her own inspiration, and not from some formula :)

it was weird because my own conclusion from these to different online videos is probably opposite of what is to be expected, because I determined that I thought slysssa was perhaps more attractive without makeup. actually, I should say it backwards: the picture that she showed of herself with makeup, I did not find any more (and perhaps even less) attractive than her without makeup. however, with bec, who has *much* more extreme makeup, I concluded that I really liked how her makeup looks... I dunno.

I get some reactions to that last sentence saying that it's kinda like clown makeup, but I disagree. have you ever seen a clown with makeup on? it's gross. consider what bec would look like doing the videos if she didn't have that makeup on. first, she'd have to do a wider angle shot, and you couldn't see the contours of her face move around so much when she explains things with so much animation, so her videos would be a whole lot less visually captivating..

I mean, I literally just stared at someone's face for 10 minutes without looking too long elsewhere. if you have ever paid attention to me, you will notice that I have tremendous difficulty looking at someone for more than 10-20 seconds, so to capture my attention like that for so long, definitely for me says something. I dunno

I think this subject will get more thought from me.
