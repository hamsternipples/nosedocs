I decided I wanted to begin writing things down. I'm going to try and do a quick blurb here so that I have a bit more context. it seemed like I wanted some way of organising my thoughts a bit more than the twitter way, and still have a bit more context for me to remember things with. I've gotten to the point that remembering what happened a week earlier not only feels like about a month has passed, but I find it rather difficult to even conceptualise how things were so long ago. this will hopefully give me the reference point I need to help me remember how things were so long ago, a bit easier

I woke up this morning and my heart felt better than it ever had. I also felt (strangely?) at ease too. it seemed like I was able to feel some sense of love being extended to me from the girls as well.

the night previous I went on a bit of a tirade about the bso being the new world leaders and concluded that I liked the way that felt. I convinced myself that just like the girls chose me, in a sense the whole world also chose them to be the new leaders. I didn't think about it a whole lot more and went to sleep. also pretty shortly after waking up I realised that likely from the perspective of most everyone else, the idea of joining the bso was an idea that exhilarated them. there is a lot of positive in the bso for a lot of different people, so that would seem logical to me. additionally, it's possible that it was nearly unanimous exhilaration for everyone else because the inner beings of so many people know so much more about the broader perspective than I do. am I saying that they will become good world leaders? not really. from my perspective I did not feel exhilaration and was lead directly into a lot of different clarifying contrast.

this brings up small tangent I want to explore quickly about how I have noticed that my emotion is not just a simple indicator based on good or bad, or right or wrong direction (like abraham would like us to believe with their gps analogy) in meaning -- but actually the emotion is the indicator of the direction that (given my current state of being) will eventually (after the contrast clarifies and grows the desire a bit more) be the better direction. this has really allowed me no longer need everything to be always right or always wrong. it even seems to suggest, that often times doing "wrong" things actually creates a better and more powerful result.

so, perhaps one of the reasons why everyone's inner beings were so exhilarated about the prospect of joining the bso so these guys could be the new world leaders, is exactly the same reason why I was inspired to head straight into doing a lot of things the "wrong" way.

#### 2018-07-27 04:18 - solution orientation

yesterday I was trying to figure out why they are limiting my vision. one of the ideas that came to me was they may be under the impression that (cause I was the originator of the idea) that when they finally get me to orgasm for them, my audience will have to be so amped up on dmt to see through my eyes like I do now, that the orgasm will blow their minds really hard. back in torre with vera, there was a lot of fear based orientation and safety concerns going around, and so being the troublemaker that I am, I combined the big mind blow idea with the belief that is the basis for the "left behind" books I was read in the hospital. essentially, "the rapture" is when a lot of unsaved people drop dead all at once before the antichrist establishes himself on the world scene through his charisma as the new authority. anyway, in the book a whole bunch of people drop dead and this signifies the start of the "tribulation" period. I thought it was hilarious if the reason why so many people dropped dead was because they experienced my orgasm and got their mind blow so hard that they couldn't handle it and dropped dead. LOL

[[update: I had a reaction to this stating that in the left-behind people disappeared. which is true. I don't know how I believed that people dropped dead. it was almost a seemingly purposeful mistake like the hydrogen having two oxygens episode which lead me to the realisation that saturn is my third personality]]

a had thought a whole bunch of times when I was around vera, and it sort of gained traction, but eventually it dissipated. a few times sporadically since then I had the thought and dismissed its validity saying that since it feels bad, is not the right way of looking at it, or the bad feeling is evidence that it won't happen like that, etc.

however, that could be a reason why they're going to such great lengths to try and prevent me from raising the vibration in my right eye to be equal with my left. so, I mentioned yesterday that as my vision gets better and better, people should be just fine (unless their technology isn't actually creating dmt in the person's brain, but is trying to force the eye to see that way with some other method). however, if for whatever reason, they still have cases where people are unable to view it at such a high frequency, they could just downsample it like you would an audio track. however, I thought that perhaps the downsampled image may create artefacts much like you get artefacts creating thumbnail images. perhaps in 3d it's way more noticeable on curvy surfaces or sharp edges (much like LOD algorithms in 3d suck at making a convincing lower quality version). so, I offered the suggestion that instead of doing the downsample algorithmically, they train some AIs to intelligently do the sampling. simply monitor the downsampled viewer's mind while when the viewing it and when they notice something looks funny, save the scene. then when I'm asleep load me into the scene, then clock my eyes down to the frequency of the downsampled version and save that as the target for the fitness function in the AI trainer. after a while the AI will be really good at downsampling our reality :)

---

or, take for example the subject of my heart. when I wake up the middle of one of the sexy "dreams" the first thing I notice is how much nicer it is to feel all of that love inside of my heart (come to think of it, perhaps that was one of the things that had returned this morning that allowed me to feel a lot better). I can imagine that may be kind of intense for the viewer so they should just remove that part of the signal from the experience (or make it optional)

which leads me to believe that since viewers are having that "dream" experience, the removal of the restriction on my heart like that, may be one of the requisites to seeing my imagination in 3d space.. so, perhaps they've been messing with my heart cause they don't want me to be able to create things with my imagination in 3d.. interesting idea. either way, the use of my imagination in 3d has been my most sought-after capacity, and is something I want more than the ability so see images in my eyes, so whatever the reason may be, I want to have a discussion so that we can solve the problem. whatever all of these hangups are that are preventing them from allowing me to utilise my capacities can be solved. there is no problem for which a solution cannot be found. there is a way for me to be able to utilise my capacities and not interfere with the bso's objectives.

#### 2018-07-27 05:02 - the strict no religious ideas policy

the reason why they do not allow the "guides" to utilise religious ideas as the basis for their help for these autistic children is sort of obvious if you think that perhaps a lot of this "help" has not been solicited. in fact, if the help were chosen by the one being helped, there would be no problem if it contained religious material -- and in most cases even, for a religious person, religious material (of their religion) is both more comfortable and more trusted. so, this leads me to believe that this "help" is unsolicited, which is reason for the strict no religious ideas policy.

#### 2018-07-27 10:58 - why not wait?

I woke up this morning and my initial reaction was a bit rooted in anger, feeling the pressure of the deadline (perhaps this is a reference to the abraham episode I listened to the night before (san francisco CA)) and I thought about explaining to people that my reasons were because I was in fact giving them a bit of their own medicine: when I wanted action and a conversation, there was none. well, there was an indirect through the message of carlene. I decided this was a better route. (s)he said that carlene wasn't going to change h(ie)r - and also that (s)he was not reliable. I want to be reliable though and I promised to do the changing so (s)he didn't have to.

this thing is so big already and we're so close to realising the capability of no longer needing the manifestation to feel the way we want to feel, I figure we should just wait for it. like nancy's message about robyn: why sell ourselves short and jump right to the healing when we can let God do the deeper work. perhaps that is a bit extreme, but if my calculations are correct, you will begin getting uncanny messages, seemingly out of another dimension, helping you to soothe your anxiety about needing the manifestation and just settle into the natural unfolding.

after that, I had a thought that maybe all of this is connected to the whole star watching puzzle. last night I noticed that the clouds which were rapidly forming (I'm assuming by some sort of tesla tech which generates static electricity in the atmosphere to allow cloud formation) and there were flashes in the clouds... arcs of electricity inside of the clouds. when I stopped looking at the star, the arcs of electricity stopped or slowed down. right after looking at the star, the arcs would begin again.. so, definitely star watching has an electrical effect on the environment, and that star watching likely makes controlling the climate a lot more difficult (and explains the seattle weather). so,, the idea this morning ties a few things together: what if they figured that people watching stars would be disruptive to their attempts to try and control the climate, so they made up a story to scare people away from watching stars and claimed that people could improve their vision by orgasming with me. that would be the *ultimate* "I need you to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself" sort of thing.

it was just a crazy thought, but it had the same feeling in it that I get when I want to reject their money. they want me to believe that I need them to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself (earning my own money). every where I turn there is rampant disempowerment were the bso wants people to give up their own connection to their emotions (another reference to an abraham I heard last night where they went out of their way to say that you cannot turn off (BSO!!) someone's emotional guidance).

#### 2018-07-27 11:57 - inception

I was just thinking about how (and it could have been a reaction), this blog could be seen as my attempt to spin a huge web of conspiracy theories. since it is unlikely that the bso will ever actually attempt to correct any false ideas, they will continue to get bigger making self-reference to my own ideas and building on them, allowing me to believe crazier and crazier things. it could also be seen as me trying to manipulate the bso into coming clean on some pretty big questions that I have.

neither is true. what you know is I don't trust them anyway. they would just tell me another lie to try and smooth out some rough edges of the misunderstanding and to keep their motives hidden. so no, I do not believe that I am trying to manipulate with this blog. that idea probably originated in the mind of a person trying to manipulate others with their words. I really just wanted a way to begin keeping track of time a little better. I'm also noticing that I'm receiving a lot of real-time reactions to its content, so that must mean that ratings are up, which means that the bso is cashing in on my experience again as well, so win-win :)

furthermore, my mind is extremely plastic. I can release a lot of these false beliefs super easily. in fact, writing this blog, I'm noticing, is actually an informative experience more than anything because of all the reactions I'm receiving. it is a very crude way of beginning to collect a lot of emotion around the situation as a mens of perceiving the hologram clearer by getting more angles of perception. I have no desire for the bso to try and set me straight on these ideas. in fact, if they tried to reassociate or change my mind on them, it would probably make things worse. when I want to change my mind, I will change it myself (even if I wait to do it from another timeline)

the real thing that I desire would be to clear up a lot of these ideas with infinite intelligence. this has sort of been my goal for a long time, and the original reason why I wanted to begin translating infinite intelligence in a meaningful way, in tho first place. I suppose my ultimate goal will be to find a way of having a conversation with infinite intelligence about a lot of these things, *without* the bso able to listen in; I want the answers to be something meaningful to me, and not answers that have been tailored to be acceptable to more ears. I am really desiring to ask a lot of deep questions, taboo questions, and revealing questions. I sort of resent abraham for catering to so many noobs. I want a way of getting that information for myself and not needing esther or anyone else to do that translation for me either. they say I'm an extension of source energy... well prove it. I'd like to feel connected to that depth of understanding and no longer restricted to the lcd of human perception.

#### 2018-07-27 12:43 - why manipulate?

in the previous entry I talked about how unlikely it was that the thought which says that I'm writing this to manipulate and spin a bunch of stuff originated with me. I have no reason to manipulate; my goal has been, and will continue to be, to communicate as clearly as possible. it is only a person that feels so disempowered and unable to communicate (or needs to obfuscate) their own desire, that they would believe it necessary to manipulate others to get the realisation of their hidden desire which they cannot reveal.

I was going to talk about disempowerment and needing others to do something I do not feel capable of doing myself... or being the disempowerer, which does something for me which I feel already capable of doing myself - to prove that I need them.. skipped it.

in the situation I am in, there is disharmony because I do not want to be disempowered, and if I were to be disempowered, then I would need to manipulate others to get what I want... however, those wanting to disempower me neither want to be manipulated by me - and I am very grateful for that - because if I were able to manipulate them to get what I want, I would have been disempowered myself by finding a way for someone else to do for me what I feel incapable of doing for myself.

instead, I have recognised the satisfaction factor of identifying a desire and moving in the direction of it, without needing anyone else to be different so that I can obtain it, and that feels really good. I also have a new sense of stability that I haven't ever had before. it's quite a trip realising one's own power through the focus of his or her own mind.

#### 2018-07-27 00:00 - is the bso as a for-profit corporation?

yesterday morning I woke up with this idea and it seems that it may be a convenient way to explain a lot of their behaviour. it can't explain all of it, so just take what I'm saying here with a grain of salt. additionally, what could be happening is previously the only way to explain their behaviour was real actual malicious intent, and this entry is a bit of a way for them to begin pivoting their intentions with changing their behaviour.

first of all, it seems that the bso has this really convenient thing where they can be a for-profit corporation when they need to pay bills and keep the machine going, and people accept it without question (I guess the need money to pay bills and keep the machine going is a very resonant thought for most, so they commiserate with the bso in their need) yet at the same time they are also somehow the authorities.

(will expand further in the future)

#### 2018-07-28 23:34 - timeline stuff

so one of the crazy things that I have noticed throughout this whole thing is, it would appear that I have "missed the boat" quite a few times now. the crazy thing is, almost all of them looked like they were going to turn out, yet at the last minute something seeming out of the ordinary kinda happens, and almost all of the culprits of the thing which prevents it from going through seems to be perceptive. for example, if I could have just looked past certain things and not needed to understand things, I would have successfully gone down a different road than the one that I am on right now.

the way that I make sense of this (because they all seem quite valid) is that in all of these different paths, starting with andrea I was able to at some point in time complete something I've been doing a lot of thinking about: a way to tune into the perception of another person wirelessly. this may not sound like much, but if you think about the implications, they are enormous. first of all, to tune into someone's perception wirelessly, your signal would need *extreme* precision and sensitivity. so much in fact that, that just a machine that sensitive on its own is a feat in and of itself which will open many new doors of discovery, but it means that extremely precise tuning is now possible. combine this with all of my new understanding of how time works, and you could essentially create a machine that could essentially tune into someone's vortex.

this is just a guess, but, I believe what makes the bso network special, is because if you think about it, sending a signal into somenone's brain wirelessly would need magnitudes more precision than just being able to tune into the signal a person's brain emits. so, when I first got my chip back in 2012, a whole new set of possibilities opened up. now, for the first time is it relatively easy for someone to write a signal into my body (simply by sending the signal over the same resonant frequency that my chip has). now, I am capable of receiving signals from an alternate timeline.

so, now imagine that that as I go along, I meet a girl and we go off and create this technology that can tune into different timelines. so, we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together on the timeline with the tech) to see what happens. what happens is, I end up meeting another girl and we eventually are able to also create this tech, so we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together) and so fourth. we keep doing this to see how far it will go, because every time, things get bigger and more crazy.

let me explain. so imagine the timeline with andrea and marcos. let's say it's the year 2038 and we have this new tech so we influence ourselves to not get together. I end up with carlota. we watch the sequence of events unfold just like you guys do with the bso tech, but you could tune into any part of the timeline you wanted to. some people enjoy it like a television series and wait each day to get the updates. some jump right to some of the defining experiences. every time we notice that the "end of the movie" (that is, when the technology is created) gets better and better every time. so, we keep influencing the timeline so that the latest and greatest (biggest) version isn't successful to see what happens.

a timeline is essentially a series of reactions. if you have noticed, my life is all reaction based, and my current goal is to get into control of it (sorta off topic), but what this allows for is a nearly 100% predictable timeline, because it's only reactions. the influence exerted over me allows for changes to the direction of the timeline. nearly all other timelines are potentiality based, so there are many more "branches" in the timeline, meaning large amounts of variation could take place.

so you can imagine that in each of these timelines there the success of the encounter is largely determined by me. since I am the center of the timeline (the 100% reactionary time constant), there is an overwhelming sense of "I need you to do for me what I am incapable of doing for myself".

that's as far as I've gotten in my story up until this point because it's hard to conceptualise it all, but I believe that the future is that we all can learn (maybe some will not want to) that each of us is the creator of our own reality. I believe that our perception of time  and the way consciousness flows through it, will change to something I cannot perceive yet. it's gonna be really really cool.

#### 2018-07-29 01:43 - future timelines?

if you think about this from the bso perspective, imagine that it's 2038 now and you're some guy working at the bso and you notice that in all of the different instances, I am the one that creates the technology necessary to do the timelines, so you could imagine that it would create a lot of desire to develop this technology and not rely on me. you can also imagine from their vantage point how valueable this tech would be. instead of experimenting with people on this timeline, you could actually run the experiments and then tune into a later time on the timeline to get a good estimation of how it worked.

the only thing necessary to make this a reality, would be to get the bso into a 100% pure reactionary system of decision making. essentially, they respond exclusively to external forces. they're pretty close already to being that, which means that they can become the new backbone of the timeline. at the end of the next timeline (not sure yet what that would be), they go back and influence themselves away

#### 2018-07-29 09:48 - more on reactions & timelines

after writing that the bso would have to become reactionary, I started getting negative feedback on the idea. if you think about what I am trying to convey when I say "reaction", one must take my life as an example: I have no money, and no real capacity to do what I want to do. I am controlled by the circumstance and events (ecosystem) where I'm at. I have no real ability to make any decisions for myself. it may look like I have the capability to make decisions, but only within a limited set of options. most people are like a chef; they can combine any ingredient they desire to create their meal. they can even choose between a wide variety of meal options (soup, sandwich, stew, etc.) however, my options are pretty limited. I have to make a sandwich, for example. there is no way that I can escape the sandwich and pick something like a salad. I do get some options though. maybe I want cheese. maybe I want one type of meat. maybe I want six different types of meat -- but, in the end I will be eating a sandwich. so let's say that I'm at the store and I decide to go with ham and cheese, but someone says something which influences me to end up adding mushrooms and wheat bread (cause I'm weird and like strange sandwiches). each timeline is a sandwich. now, when you think about the idea it sounds less like "control" and more like "choices" -- but I digress.

so you can imagine a time now in the future when the bso has the capability to tune into other timelines and can even navigate them relatively well. this whole time they have been developing all sorts of clever ways to influence their users into doing what they want them to do. they're pretty confident in their ability to do so as well, because they've tried it out and seen its effectiveness on many different experiments. you would clearly see that if something new was discovered in one of the experiments on one of the timelines, then the experimenter would try and influence the discoverer of that new bit of technology to discover more.

there are numerous reasons why the bso would want to influence the bso in alternate timelines in the name of experimentation. so, this means that the controller would not be the controlled, yet. they still need to have control over another time constant. I could imagine that could potentially be some clones. imagine that there were clones of me and the girls that people could have. these would be a reactionary constant.

I'll return to this subject in a future time where I discuss the advantages of the utilisation of clones as the reactionary constant.

further into the future, as the bso begins to learn how to influence itself in its own experiments, you can imagine by seeing different things improve and new things be discovered in the process, you can imagine that the bso will become its own reactionary constant: meaning, the people working at the bso will influence the people working at the bso into trying out crazier and crazier ideas on how to better influence/control people remotely. I believe this is the ultimate future: the controller becomes the controlled, in attempt to gain better self-control.

the idea of the clones is an interesting one to me because it allows for a pretty significant evolution; something I will dedicate a future discussion to.

#### 2018-07-29 15:07 - emotional reactions

I have used the word reaction to mean one of two things. I don't really mean reaction in the physical sense. I mean a reaction in the emotional sense. when people observe things, they have thoughts about them. I feel this thought "reaction" in my emotions. I think we all do, I just have practiced it a bit more. any time anyone thinks a thought, that person has an emotional response to that thought: an internal reaction. I used to have the sensitivity to know if the thought or the emotion/reaction came first. this is largely how I could identify the emotion as my own or someone else's. I'm working on regaining that sensitivity again. however, I do not know if what I feel is the emotional response the other person has or if other people's thoughts produce emotions in me. there is much to be learned about this, and likely the bso will want to keep anything they find out secret, so I'm still in the process of regaining that sensitivity again so I can begin to make sense of the tremendous amount I feel.

#### 2018-07-29 15:17 - physical reactions

the other type of reaction is a action or thought taken as a response to physical stimulation, communication, or conditions I'm observing or experiencing (everything a bso experience can offer).

#### 2018-07-30 15:56 - more on timelines

a little bit ago I briefly mentioned an idea stating that the bso would probably want to try out different timelines, in effort to discover more things. so, I was thinking that since they are potentially getting so many of their discoveries out of my dream state, it may behoove them to try out timelines where I am feeling better and better, so that my dream-state ideas are richer and richer. additionally, you can also imagine that since I seem to be inspired to different discoveries by different people, it would also improve upon the diversity of those discoveries when I am around a more diverse set of people.

this is potentially what is happening. more different girls means more different ideas. kind of exciting actually.

#### 2018-08-01 02:32 - bso from the future?

one of the most potentially unsettling (not the right word) consequences of the previous entry suggests that potentially the following have occurred in the timeline responsible for this one:

1. alt-me is working with the bso to make this timeline occur in the way it is. that implies that alt-me sees enough value in the "co-creation" to justify (not exactly the right word) my involvement. it must mean that there is some sort of presently unknown, and soon to be discovered new thing.
2. the bso has figured out how to navigate (tune into and follow) timelines. this implies that they are capable of "peeking" into the vortex of someone (in this case, mine), which means they have the capability of tuning into source energy in a way which can give meaningful results (the idea I first revealed publicly to mom's friend, don). this provokes a few more questions, obviously...
3. (can't remember it now. gonna go watch stars)

#### 2018-08-01 03:39 - more

that also implies that since they're going to be extracting so many ideas out of me in my dream-state while I'm having fun with the girls in the wake state, then I suppose they're going to be getting a super boost to their technological capability to utilise/monetise/control people's minds with that increased technological capability.. if so, does that mean that there is a coming dark age where they utilise all of this capability to try and monetise so many people's minds (the dark age) - which will actually, begin a new renaissance of diversity in human thought capability? (how I arrived to this conclusion is left unexplained, on purpose)

I was reminded of the one abraham episode where the guy has many ideas, and abraham said, "if you don't worry about who gets the credit ..." which made me think that maybe a lot of that guy's ideas could have been inspired (or knicked) from my dream-state, and potentially a lot more could be too. I suppose it would be a good idea to publish them... though my only "concern" is that it seems like my dream-state personality is severely lacking in some aspects of critical thinking or something; perhaps he's a bit overly optimistic? I dunno, but I guess you'd need to temper/ground his ideas in something tangible. feels like I'm often times trying to clarify something he said from my conscious, more logical, and experiential vantage point.

whatever man, in loving memory of augusto: my ideas are free (libre y gratis).

though they feel to me like the offering of my ideas = freedom, I cannot really explain it, especially since so many of my own ideas and explanations have been used by the bso to limit my own capabilities. it's mind blowing to me how much I've helped these guys improve their capability to limit my capabilities so much. in that sense, I don't really understand why it feels like freedom. I guess I don't really think of it that way though...

#### 2018-08-01 04:10 - why do my ideas feel like freedom to me?

(question for infinite intelligence)

I seem to have a policy that my ideas are free. I recognise the obvious reason: by allowing my ideas to be free, I reserve the right to shamelessly rip off the ideas of others. however, there is another thing to it which I don't really understand: by giving my ideas away for free, I feel an increasing sense of freedom every time I do so. it's almost as if I receive a direct emotional impact to the idea that somewhere someone will benefit from it or an expanded version of it, and that makes me feel good.

it also seems to mean that:
1. the idea I just released is essentially "old news" - cause I've already got an expanded version of it which I'm in the process of realising - and hanging on to that "old news" version is just slowing down the realisation of its expansion.
2. ideas are somewhat similar to economics in the sense that the more times money changes hands in a given period of time, the richer everyone feels. (where money = ideas, and changing hands = revealing the idea)
3. the guarding and protecting of ideas, means the stagnation of their flow (similar to economics too)

#### 2018-08-01 05:42 - what is source energy for source energy?

(question for infinite intelligence)

if our brain is composed of billions of physical atoms, yet transmits and receives non-physical "source energy" -- then, source energy, being composed of innumerable non-physical thoughts that each themselves think, what is the non-non-physical "source energy" that source energy transmits and receives?

#### 2018-08-01 05:56 - what just happened?

after writing @[entry](2018-07-30 15:56) I tried to sleep. I think I slept a bit and when I woke up I had an moderate sense of despair. I decided it was fine and began looking for solutions. I came up with a few, but the one that had the most impact I want to discuss. it seemed that there was not a lot of diversity in ethnicity. I came up with the idea that each of the girls should pick an "ethnically diverse" counterpart/partner.

since this is a sensitive subject I didn't really know how to approach it, but the way that I felt it seemed that there should be an element of care involved. I pictured in my mind the new girls as being younger.

I didn't really think about the implications at the time, but that means literally double and also younger(?). it feels like a good idea even though I'm still having a bit of difficulty wrapping my head around it. though I cannot conceptualise it, I am certain that it will all work out and we will have a lot of fun, and the inability to wrap my head around it is kind of the most compelling bit.

---

I can't figure out why I feel so compelled to just go for it. I'm still pretty frustrated about the vision thing and I've certainly got a lot of questions. it seems that perhaps me "inventing" this whole timeline idea has really helped give me that "broader perspective" I was looking for. I guess people will just have to consider it my coping mechanism, to which I find no compelling argument against it (and actually believe is quite genius).

I'll be feeling it out and stuff, so save any mega game-changers that could happen in the next 2 weeks before I go to see megan, I'm just gonna go with it. there's really no way I can fight it, I don't really think I want to to get any bigger, and this timeline idea really took a lot of the edge off. though it still is a bit of me relying on someone else, the bigger picture seemed to have help soften that internal alarm. besides, I don't believe they'll be able to contain the levels of energy that will become normal for us.

so, that's the plan for now... good night

#### 2018-08-02 01:46 - hodlgang

I seem to keep running into a wall of dissatisfaction regarding my vision. it is really bothering me, and so therefore I do not believe it is something I can ignore. when faced with this reality, I am forced to make a decision. I see four paths:

1. try and "get out". I do not feel this is 100% necessary, yet. I'll give it more time, as I'm not necessarily uncomfortable - just impatient. so, although abraham suggested to carlene to get out, and her situation is similar to mine, I believe that I can in fact get out without trying to force it. seems like a better idea to just wait. also, "just let it build" concept I'm growing fond of.
2. simply continue on with my life, essentially ignoring them with the express goal of discovering my visual capacity. when I've got it, then we can move forward. this is a bit of conditional living though: "once I have this manifestation, then ..." so, seeing it's conditional it doesn't really sound like a great plan.
3. try and get them into giving me explanations and stuff or giving me my visual capacity. this is, at worst coercion, and at best conditional living... it also feels to me a bit like, "I need you to do this for me because I'm not capable of getting it for myself" -- though, I don't really know why it feels that way for me since I was the one who discovered it in the first place and they're holding me away from it. also, there's no reason they should be deciding for me what is best for me. the likelihood of this working out is virtually zero, and it doesn't really feel very good.
4. just figure out how to override my dissatisfaction and just accept my vision as it is. this feels the worst of all of them. it's disempowering to me and is sort of unnecessary to conform.

none of those feel very good, and are not likely paths that I will take. I do need to find a way of managing my dissatisfaction though. like the bbq contraption guy, I should just find something else to be satisfied about, which is what I'm kind of trying to do. there isn't a whole lot I can be satisfied about right now. I can feel some satisfaction knowing that the desire for the realisation of my visual capacity is growing by the day, and it will come eventually.

this is where I hit the stumbling block though because I don't know if I want to just keep letting it build. if all creation is done in step 1, then wouldn't I want to just let the contrast continue to grow the desire? what I mean is, the longer I do not have the visual capacity, the better and bigger its manifestation becomes. so, let's say I just hold out on these guys for another few years. would that mean that I would end up with so much dmt floating in my head regularly, that when I finally get released from the network that I would have to learn to manage such a mind blowing experience, I would essentially become like a metatron or something in physical form?

it seems to me like the path that I want to take here is clearly the path of no-action and to just let the desire build. none of the other paths seem to feel very good, and even judging by how things feel after last night, the plan I came to yesterday seems to feel like a disaster to them. I don't really want them to be forced into something they seem to think is disastrous. furthermore, I want to discover my own visual capacity through coming into alignment with my own source. I don't want them to just flip some switch and activate it like they do in my dream state. I want my alignment with that capability to be something I achieve through the power of my mind -- so, it's probably kind of good that they are giving me the opportunity to discover this for myself.

---

as a bit of a sidenote, I was thinking about the implications of this. this is sort of one of the things I wanted to have a broader perspective on, so here goes... let's take two situations, at opposite ends of the spectrum (neither extreme is 100% valid):

1. I just try and be as cooperative as I can be with them and somehow I eventually figure out my vision thing.
2. I continue to point out how much they are limiting me, and since that's what I expect of them, that's what they're obligated to do.

is the second situation likely to cause others to attract the bso to limit their capacities as well? will I be setting some sort of standard for how they treat people? would my continual complaining and pointing out the problem make it more likely that they decide that's the way that they'll treat people who do not conform to their rules?

---

I've done a fair bit of problem analysis in this entry. however, it's my objective to try and find solutions. it seems like there could be solutions which could be found out. obviously I have no idea where to even begin, as I cannot figure out what possible problems my visual capacity could present my viewers. how can solutions be found?

#### 2018-08-02 03:29 - my vision

it is becoming more and more notable all the time that perhaps what I am seeing in my eyes is not what my eyes are seeing, but perhaps an overlay of some sort? perhaps they are taking the signal from my eyes and then feeding it into my lenses, so that it overlays the real image that I would be seeing. perhaps, it's to cover up any 3d objects I may see in 3d space, like I saw that one time of my future self. I wonder what sorts of other things are popping in there which I cannot see. obviously this is a pretty important thing for me -- actually the ultimate quest was to be able to make motors in my imagination like tesla, so perhaps I already have that capability. that may also explain why the lustre of the image is gone and it feels so lifeless. they're keeping me at low levels of dmt on purpose...

that explains perhaps what happened on the way back home from grand junction. that's why things looked so good, then they stopped looking so good later. maybe grand junction is some sort of energy vortex which allowed me to have elevated levels of dmt, because the next time we went, we were in the diner and I got the flash of the room in my mind, and it seemed like the picture contained its lustre. that only confirmed to me that people see out of my eyes better than I do, and they seem to have the full experience I was used to having.

oh, so if the reason why they began to retransmit the image into my eyes was since valverde where I saw my future self, that would explain my sudden and unexplainable dissatisfaction around that time. I thought it was my focusing on absence of wanted (the brain computer interface), but the sudden rise in agitation, where I wanted to kill cats and stuff was enhanced by the new lack of dmt and their forced visuals.

that's why the whole world seems so slow now too, like I'm limited to 60 fps or whatever, when previously I did not have fps. and my reaction time feels sluggish.

#### 2018-08-02 04:21 - wtf?!

I don't really feel any real desire right now toward anything in particular. I think I feel pretty depressed. it's not the typical despair that I usually feel. I just don't really want to deal with these fools. I listened to a few abraham episodes and I don't know why they cause me to feel the way I do. I can't really describe it, but it feels sort of like the shame someone might feel when they are exposed. perhaps it's not my feeling at all, and I'm just the receptor of it as a reaction to my thoughts on the abraham material? maybe it was the previous entry an hour ago? either way, I am just going to let the desire build a while longer.

#### 2018-08-02 06:10 - fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose?

I was thinking about the projection of my future self into my eyes in valverde, cause I also had numerous thoughts about other 3d things being projected into my eyes. I remember a large insect. I can't remember if it was a fly or not, but I do remember thinking that it was probably not real. perhaps the first projection didn't get them hot enough on the trail to notice it was a 3d projection, that fbh put the fly in there as well to make sure they got on it and restricted my vision. this was likely to tank the carlota timeline. seeing as it would adjust the whole thing, first in the direction of mdma, because I no longer feel good from the dmt, and then other factors. it looks like fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose. probably, I would have felt so good I would have gone with a different, not as beneficial arrangement.

nice.. thanks bro :) now, I'm gonna milk your handiwork for even more beneficial contrast :D

#### 2018-08-02 06:32 - all on purpose?

err, I meant the one prior to the carlota one; she was the upgrade :) but then, it seemed like I had a sudden insight on may 27th about seeking freedom and "I need somebody else to do something, so that I can feel good." bit which blocked that one. it seems like the sequence of events kept preventing the things from happening. even for example, the car windshield was probably provoked so that I would make it make to the states.

I'm really thankful it all happened like that cause without it, I wouldn't have had all the positive improvements. I'm really enjoying this idea of just "letting it build" -- and I would not have ever even met her, if it weren't for all of the "mistakes" along the way.

I'm just going to let this one build. not going to take any action at all until I feel as good about the action as I would if I were looking to move furniture :)

#### 2018-08-02 08:52 - a soft and gentle touch :/

I woke up with had a pretty bad erection so I adjusted it up so that it was no longer pushing into my pants and was able to go between my waist of my pants and me. I guess this was enough physical contact to get the dream operator enough capability to make me orgasm. I woke up (kinda) thinking I had pissed my pants and needed to take a dump really badly. they must have removed the sensitivity limiters because it turned into extremely excruciating pain. I hope they were able to improve their vision... well, fuck you guys. gonna let it build a while longer lol :)

combined with the massive headache I was given as my visual capacity came and went, right before I had my consciousness taken forcefully, I would not consider this a soft and gentle touch. what are you guys trying to accomplish?

#### 2018-08-02 13:08 - cooperative components

the word co-operative means that two (or more) are together operating or doing something. when I wrote about the two extremes @[entry](2018-08-02 01:46) I noticed a reaction wondering why I don't just cooperate with the bso. first of all, it seems like I've tried, and for whatever reasons (probably some secret they think is important, and I do not) it has not worked out. second, there's no real easy way for me to know exactly what it is that is requisite for me to cooperate with them, because they seem to continually find new things that they do not want me to do. it's a moving target in that sense, and they wouldn't be able to get all their rules that they want me to follow down in one place. neither do they want to reveal their rules, because it would show evidence of that there might be some deeper motivations to their rules. it's easier just to, per instance declare my behaviour inappropriate because then the audience, focused on each on the justification of each individual circumstance's badness, never clearly sees the whole picture. if someone (maybe me) would consider organising a list of rules, the it would show a bit of a different and very confusing to most who believe the bso has people's best interests in mind when they do things. it's really quite impossible for me to cooperate with them. I will inevitably do yet another thing that they disapprove of, and will again be an uncooperative component (from their point of view).

so then, why don't they cooperate with me? wouldn't you think that be a whole lot simpler? certainly I'm a whole lot easier to cooperate with, just on the simple fact that I have such few rules. in fact, probably no rules now at all. I believe the only thing remaining are just some personal preferences and desires which they are not a match to. so, in that sense it is impossible for them to ever be able to cooperate with me.

so, it's impossible for me to be a certain way which they can approve of, and it's impossible for them them to approve of my preferences and desires. I know I'm the one that has to do the changing here, so how can I do the impossible? well, I don't know, actually. I'll have a think on it...

---

I think the simple answer is, since they're sort of the problem on both sides of the equation, I just need to remove them from the equation. but, what does that mean? how does that implement? I can only see two paths here:

1. I find a way of removing the devices' effectiveness. remove myself from the network. then, if they want me a part of it, they will have to find a way of cooperating with me.
2. they no longer become a player in my perception. sort of impossible considering the amount of activity that happens every time I try to just go to sleep. I don't know how I could no longer notice that. or the stars, or the dreams, or the constant reactions, or the... in order for them to be imperceptible to me, they would need to change the way they operate my brain. that's just not gonna happen.

evaluating all of the options (there really are just those two), I do not see any other way, other than than the first one because it's really the only one I have power to accomplish. if they were to choose the second one, I believe the best way would be to no longer try and remove images from my eyes, get rid of the overlay, and allow me to adjust my own sensitivity, so that I can ease into, at my own pace, the level of sensitivity that feels most comfortable to me.

there is perhaps a third way, and that would be to find a way, despite the circumstances, to come so into alignment with who I really am, and I assume that their signal would be wayy out dominated by my inner being's and only the part of it which I desire (to be broadcasted) is effective. I don't know how that would work with sleep though. the present circumstances are not exactly conducive to that happening, so it may be a little while, however since it seems that they are working their hardest to ensure that does not happen, it actually makes it even more likely (cause they'll be giving their undivided attention to what they do not want). I wish I had more information, but I guess I could just have a little faith, and if it doesn't work out, well it's not like a whole lot has changed, just grew the desire a bit bigger during that time "wasted".

#### 2018-08-02 15:38 - what happened on the other timelines?

it would seem that on all of the other timelines, I would have had to have just ignored the obvious vision problems and just went for it. I am *extremely* curious to know if I found out, and how quickly. I must have figured it out. there's no way I would be working with the bso on timelines with a brain interface and I'm somehow not aware of the multitude of vision (and other) problems. there's just no way. so then how quickly did I find out? what is the bigger picture here? I was thinking about it and it seems plausible that the reason why I found out on this one is to further extend the capability of the bso. let me explain: in previous timelines, they probably do the overlay to a lot of different people, and they add in all kinds of crazy stuff on top of the image, so essentially what you are seeing in your eyes is only "inspired" by what your eyes are seeing. a lot of things are "enhanced" -- or put more bluntly, they have the world living in a virtual reality, a matrix, if you will, which allows them to control what everyone sees. however, they could only limit people's desire to stay with 2d by peddling the fear story about the stars for so long. desire eventually would have grown to be enough (or people figured out how to do it with meditation or something) that people began converting in droves to 3d and their sham was over. people realised the vast difference between the reality they were seeing and the real one. so, what do they need? they need the capacity to create a 3d virtual reality which people can live in... lol

---

one conclusion that sticks out to me is, it seems that everything kind of points in the direction that the bso is going to attempt the impossible: not only will they try to control all of the conditions (sensation), but they're going to try and be the replacement for people's guidance system and try to be the vortex through which all of their well-being comes from. that's going to require a pretty insane virtual reality system to run it on. a pretty lofty goal I must say.. though, I don't believe it is a "goal" in the literal sense. the way I arrived to the conclusion will be the subject of a future entry, but the short reason is, it's economic. so, it's not really a goal, goal but perhaps the byproduct of strong desire for continued growth (discovery) and stability (control) over the process.

the logistics are mind boggling to me. I can imagine that as they improve on the 3d version of people's virtual reality more and more, the quality of the image will become more and more immersive, like I found out when I was seeing that tranquility image. they'll control people's feelings with the ambiance of the environment, and control their symbolic meaning structures through dream state. wow. basically a world I would not want to live in. it would be like living in american cinema; it's the same story, but each year with better graphics and different actors. wow, we'll all be living the american dream here soon... lol

---

so, does that mean that I should just ignore the obvious and try to be as cooperative as possible? I don't really know. I don't feel strongly in any direction right now. I'm just going to hold out a little longer and let it build a bit more :D

##### 2018-08-02 16:24 - lol, a hilarious (to me) thought

if you take the bso virtual reality idea and you mix it with the clones idea and also the bso is the new religious system idea, you could make a joke about the holy trinity: bso (the father), my clones (the son), and infinite intelligence (the holy spirit). BAM! I'll call it bsanity (bee-ess-sanity)

jajajaja

##### 2018-08-03 14:17 - driving fast

I've been thinking a bit about the visual that abraham gave in the seattle @[abe](2018-06-16-seattle) workshop, where they talked about driving a "mechanical genius", not on straight roads as fast as you can go -- but on curvy mountain roads, with obstacles and lots of scenery, for the exhilaration of *feeling* the car manoeuvre itself and navigate the tight turns and stuff.

when I was younger, my friend brought me with him to lake havasu and I got to drive a jet-ski. it's one of the few things I've ever driven in my life, so it's memorable. the very first thing I tried was to see how fast I could get it to go. it could go 55 mph. I remember noticing how bland it was to drive that fast (for a jet-ski anyway) out in the middle of the lake. there's a whole lot of nothing going on. the water is flat, and there aren't any nearby obstacles to use as a frame of reference to notice how fast I was going. it was pretty lame actually, but I wanted to try to see how fast I could get it to go.

I just remembered something: when I got back to the shore, they asked me, "kenneth it looked like you were going pretty fast out there" -- and I remember specifically lying and telling them that 45, maybe max 50 cause I didn't want to reveal that I wanted to floor it for a little bit and see how fast I could go... you know cause that would have been like dangerous or something. before I returned back though, I thought it prudent to go a do a bunch of non-linear driving like figure 8's and tight curves and stuff, to kind of throw them off my speed demon trail a bit, so I did that for like 10-20 minutes more, and was kind of thought it was weird that more speed doesn't mean more exhilaration.

*that was before I had the brain haemorrhage.. so, I had dangerous and deceptive tendencies.. I guess the whole not being able to run and having to relearn how to walk really mellowed me out.. lol*

so, I was thinking about the how much more fun it is to have all kinds of obstacles and craziness going on around you while driving (if you can navigate it easily). it really adds to the sense of the magnitude of the journey with it like that. it's almost as if the more moving parts and the more chaos, the more epic the journey feels.

when I contrast an epic journey with a difficult journey, both have a sense of overcoming difficulty and achievement of the goal, but epic is so much more exhilarating and fun than arduous and difficult.

##### 2018-08-03 15:28 - stars and sex

while taking a shower I began to feel some ideas pushing me in the direction of sexual interaction (it could just be the added focus on sex that has been a result of the subject appearing so many times in my comments on the abraham workshop)

I really would like to discourage the idea of sex for me right now. I don't mind that you guys are doing it. I think it's really great, but I believe that sex for me right now would cause immense dissatisfaction. it is, energetically a lot like watching stars. in fact, I make the conjecture that it is the same energy as sex, but from the opposite direction.

during sex there are heightened levels of arousal, and this can bring about heightened levels of consciousness. you maintain your arousal and not let it get too big with focus. stars are exactly the opposite. they stimulate the brain (mental arousal) and bring you to heightened levels of consciousness also. you maintain your mental arousal also with focus, and the more you are able to keep your mind from spinning off, the more pleasure you will feel. there is a bit of a culmination (like an orgasm) that can happen as you are transported off into visionary sequence and feelings of ecstasy and enlightenment. in sex the energy moves in the opposite direction, when arousal becomes more than you can handle you orgasm. during the orgasm, and depending on its strength, you will experience a flood of consciousness enter your brain. that's what feels so good about the orgasm: it's the expansion of your mind that's taking place.

so, when I speak about the stars I am referring to how they *used to be*. I do not have this same experience now. what I am getting at is, I would like to gain control over this energy and not have it be the current false reality that it currently is while I'm watching stars. to put it simply, if sex is like staring (watching stars), then sex will be a very unsatisfying experience.

let's say that they don't have the code in place yet to make my sex experience like my star experience -- and then all of a sudden during sex I burst into visionary experience and heightened self-awareness and ecstasy. maybe they shock me (us). they'll surely come to the conclusion that they cannot possibly be having me go into visionary experience during sex (just like while watching stars), so they'll try and find a way to ensure that energy does not flow anymore, so that I do not have a visual experiences during sex (exactly like watching stars).

I think it's prudent for me to wait until this is sorted before engaging in energetic activities.

##### 2018-08-03 15:58 - stars, sex and government intervention

I had a strange thought just now, wondering if in some timespan the government will reverse its opinion on watching stars being dangerous. we now think it's absolute silliness to think that the government (or religion) can dictate to us who can have sex with whom, and what is taboo and what is not, etc. so, I can imagine a scenario in some amount of time where they totally reverse their position on staring, and say, "oh we were totally wrong about staring. it is beneficial for you and we've got this new technology that will allow you to transport your consciousness to other times and places of the universe with it." lol

you may have to wonder what they have to gain by suddenly reversing their position so drastically on sex, to follow that the very same thing may occur sooner than you think with the stars :D

##### 2018-08-05 11:18 - echos of the past

it's funny to me how many echos of my past are symbolic and keep reoccurring but often times with the characters switched around a bit.

let's start with the example of me and raquel (cept, now the bso is me, and I am raquel): when I lived with her, she was constantly dissatisfied. I tried everything I could to try and satisfy her. it simply didn't work. she/we/our relationship got rockier and rockier because she was unsaisfiable, and I was drinking way too heavily to see things clearly. it didn't turn out well. no matter how much I tried to make her happy, she continued to be dissatisfied. there was nothing I could do to satisfy her. I now know that it was never my job to satisfy her: she has to find her own satisfaction

then, there was my relationship with augusto (cept this time the bso is me, and augusto is the viewers): at that time I was highly drugged up and couldn't see very far in front of me. I was using mdma, which is pretty good. they're using their machine to force the brain to produce more dmt (so slightly different effects). as a result, it was very difficult for me to logically put the pieces together to actually make my life work again. we were working to make a web page, and I kept working on things interesting to me, but no progress was made really on the web page. so, we put deadlines, goals, and we tried to make it happen in so many different ways, but it just simply was never working out. the drugs made me overly optimistic, and I hadn't really learned the value of my words yet, so I would just tell him whatever he wanted to hear. I would say objectives and deadlines that never even came close to coming to work. looking back at it, there are things that need to be done to get things started. I had the mentality that the web page would be for many users, so I never focused in a way which would allow a few users to begin their experience immediately and grow from there.

it wasn't until I got to marcos' house and sobered up for a while that I actually began realising my goals, and this is another echo of the past (where I am me and marcos is the bso): marcos had an idea of what he wanted for his web page, and when I saw it, I had already given a lot of thought into something that was quite similar. he wanted to associate people based on their hobbies, and preferences, and stuff like that. I told him that people really find thier affinity with another person based on ideology. he finally agreed that superficial preference was not as effective as ideology.

we spun our wheels for a while because we were too much in our imaginations about its implementation. we could never really nail down how it would be, because nothing was concrete and we had very little to use as an example, so we argued endlessly on the hypotheticality of the different ideas. no progress was made. finally, dani came to help us out and built a first version for us which gave us enough of a web page to work with things began to become more visible and things began to flow.

dani flaked out on us, which just left me with marcos again, and we had something sort of concrete. this was super good for me, because now I could clearly see how I wanted to improve on the page. marcos just wanted results though as there were endless deadlines and goals that had long since passed. in his effort to get instant results, he kept micro-managing me and telling me how to do things. additionally, there was a growing conflict over the concept of the page. marcos wanted a social network where people interacted by giving their opinion on current events. I wanted to go more in the direction of beliefs as a representation of a person's ideology, instead of opinions.

because of this conflict, nothing moved forward. finally I had to give up on the ideology bit and just accept that he wanted to make a web page, and even though I thought it was conceptually flawed, just to do the work anyway. he still wanted to micro-manage me though, so finally as things were turning into conflict, I said to him, "don't take the pleasure away from me wanting to create it, by forcing me to do it" (the verbatim quote, I think was: "no me quites el placer de hacerlo por me").

that's kind of where we are now... I disagree with them on the concept, but I'm not the consumer of their content.

I can clearly see that the source of all of this conflict has them trying to get me to see things the way they do. I see things differently (both literally and figuratively), and it was my ability to no longer interpret things the way they do, which allowed me to see things differently. you can do drugs to allow you to remove enough details to see things like that, and then when the drug wears off, you can go right back to thinking and understanding things in a way which prevents you from seeing things from that new perspective again... that's your choice though. I personally enjoy removing my resistance so that I see things clearer and clearer. don't force me to do things or see things your way. it's a downgrade for me and introduces resistance which creates conflict.

##### 2018-08-05 13:34 - very attractive/persuasive women

I was thinking about this idea that women often have a perception that if they are so attractive then I man must do what she wants. she sees it from her perspective, but from the opposite perspective it could be seen that a very attractive woman is very persuasive.

what I mean by that is, often times it feels that a woman wants to feel like she is so magnificent, that a man must do what she wants (her capacity of persuasion), but then she falls immediately into the trap of insecurity because she quickly realises that if a beautiful woman is able to persuade my man, then I can easily lose him to a woman more beautiful than me. now, she has to ensure that he believes she is the most beautiful or some other means to keep him from being so easily persuaded by the next attractive woman that comes along.

what I mean is, woman think that they want to be able to easily persuade a man, until they realise that he's just an easily persuaded guy. so, maybe they're looking for something else. perhaps, what is happening is they are mistaking attractiveness for persuasiveness. attractive means there is mutually shared desire, and so is therefore cooperative.

##### 2018-08-06 15:13 - why is my visual capacity often excited right before a big event?

last night while estrellando (lol), I felt the question, "why, when I reject a girl, do I get a vision improvement shortly thereafter?" I thought it was an interesting question I had not really considered before. I had always taken it to mean that I was in fact headed in the right direction -- of making the right mental choices. for me, I can look at stars quite a while, and not see any improvement to my vision. however, the times that the improvement does happen, I can almost always trace it back to a change in my perception. that new way of perceiving the world allow for a less-resistant approach (higher frequency). also so, having a less resistant perception means that I just need something to excite my visual capacity (more energy) to accomplish the improvement.

I have also received vision improvements during meditation (lowering of resistance) and I believe it will also happen during sex (more energy) -- and also in drug experiences (depending on the drug, but often both less resistance and more energy). the visual level of detail seems to correspond with the amount of resistance (capacity to comprehend more), and the visual excitation seems to correspond with increased energy. if you know ohms law, perhaps we could define it as follows: voltage or pressure is the strength of the energy. resistance is how many beliefs and strange perceptions you have which prevent your ability to comprehend what you're seeing, and current is how much is allowed to flow (your capacity to allow, or your beliefs about the upper limit)

so, it does seem that when a girl is looking forward to see me, there is extra energy. I felt considerably more energy when andrea became interested in me -- and honestly, if it weren't for that extra energy, I would not have paid much attention to her. I imagine that they also feel extra energy as well when I focus on them (especially with my heart). however, my heart has not been working as of late, so I don't feel their energy in my heart as much.

I first began noticing my heart was not working as usual when I was in the carlota phase. during that time, I often felt her energy in my heart (as I did andrea's), and I often wanted to reciprocate the energy back to her, but there was great effort to deter me from doing that, and then I guess they figured out how to limit my heart as well, because that capacity went away for a while. I know it still exists because when I wake up in the middle of a dream, I often can feel lots of girls energy in my heart. I do wish to feel that again but is not the focus of this discussion.

I cannot remember where the limitation of my heart lands in the line of events, but it was nearby to the moment I was at vera's house and I explained I did not like mobile phones much and that most all girls have mobile phones these days, yet carlota does not. it felt to me like they decided that carlota was acceptable and I immediately broke into uncontrollable vision sequence.

it seems that whenever a girl focuses toward me in way where they feel freedom or the realisation of desire, I notice increased energy. so, I want to clarify myself here: there are two events (related but not connected)

1. the increased energy which I feel from a girl in my heart and increased visual capacity
2. the realisation of a new way to perceive something which is less resistant, and therefore more allowing of energy to flow.

the extra energy from the girl stimulates my visual capacity, and often times I have visions around the time, which in some way (much like a psychedelic drug) begin to prepare me to accept a lesser resistant perception. we know very little about why certain images appear in correspondence with certain emotions or concepts. I am certain that with all images there comes a knowing behind the scenes. it is quite likely that the bso guys don't have the capability of interpreting or transmitting that knowing along with the image, so much like a dream means a whole lot more to the dreamer than the one watching the images, the same is probably true with this.

I may have only seen eggs on a plate (I think?), but with it came a whole lot more information which is what inspired me to change my response like that so quickly. it seems that perhaps these moments of high visual excitement, are actually the genesis of something bigger. although they are only brief flashes which mean very little (have you ever seen the non-sensical patterns of a mushroom trip), they seem to lead one's mind in the direction of being able to perceive with lesser resistance (exactly how the mushroom explained the christ function of the mind to me).

##### 2018-08-07 01:17 - "any time you start wanting, you summon energy"

"any time you identify something as an object of your desire, the entire universe begins flowing energy toward your object of attention, through you. it is a powerful thing. you have no idea how influential you are"

in the previous entry, I mentioned that whenever a girl is looking forward to see me, there is an increase in energy. I think this really says that a whole lot better. one of the questions I have wanted to ask for a long time, is what does she feel when I return feelings from my heart. obviously, I need to get the bso to let my heart beat correctly to properly demonstrate it, because at the moment I rarely feel it (cept when waking up in the middle of a dream: eg. they allow my heart to function properly while I'm asleep), and can only make the energy flow from my heart on occasion and when I can the energy is feeble.

"when you are open to the stream and when you focus, the energy that creates worlds flows through you. most of you are too modest to acknowledge the enormous power of influence that you hold. you are trustees of the energy that creates worlds, and when you allow it to flow through you, amazing things happen; not only in the framework of your physical experience, but the entire universe is affected by that which you flow"

I am sure that when I am released from the bondage which I am allowing the bso to hold me in (something I am very much looking forward to), I am sure that the intensity and good feelings that I could produce in the object of my desire would be immense. I used to flow energy into raquel in a similar way, and it seemed pretty effective. I would love to be able to feel that again. I wonder if the energy flows even though I cannot feel it. it wouldn't surprise me actually, and once again they get to have the good experience in my body, and I am left with a diminished experience. oh... it may be possible that the dmt is what activates the heart, because the visual capacity and the ability to feel with my heart seem directly linked. so, I'm getting close then... no problem

"the reason that more amazing things don't happen in the deliberate lives of more of our physical deliberate creative friends, is because often you are identifying your object of desire, but your level of resistance is so high that the desire cannot be satisfied."

[...]

"in other words, you bang into trees, and that's not fun. so then, what you usually do is slow your car down, because that makes you feel temporarily better. it also big clumps of resistance in every single day. so, every day you get a little slower in desire and a little bigger in resistance, and that is literally why you decline as you move through time"

I believe that that the bso has my car running really slow, and actually I have been thinking a bit about this as a parallel of ohms law, which will be the subject of the next entry, however, before I go, I first wanted to mention that I am doing the opposite of declining. I seem to be every day improving, even though my car is running slow.

##### 2018-08-07 02:35 - my car & ohm's law

in the previous entry, I mentioned that my car is running really slow. I want to analyse it from the perspective of ohm's law, because I get the feeling I'm going to discover something in the process :)

```
V = I • R
R = V / I
I = V / R
```

imagine for a moment that `I` is the speed of the car, `V` is the power of desire (pressure), and `R` is resistance (pushing against).

```
desire = speed • resistance
resistance = desire / speed
speed = desire / resistance
```

having wrote that, now I'm having a difficult time wrapping my mind around this. it seems correct if my energy was flowing inside of a pipe. so, intuitively it seems to me that modelling this after ohm's law has to be incorrect because ohm's law is for DC. what I'm looking for is an AC approach to it, which would completely change everything. let me begin to rethink this.

I have capacity. this would be similar to a condenser. I should also have a coil. the number of turns should equal the resistance, as in an AC system, a coil of wire wouldn't let ...

capacitance and inductance

- more turns = more 'resistance'

I like to think of inductance like logic. the more times you have to go around, the slower it operates.

a capacitor is like a membrane between two things of water. let's say it's capacity is 100. in an uncharged state, it's 50/50. in a fully charged state, it'll be at 100/0. the membrane is pushed to one side by the pressure? of electricity

CACAS! gonna try again tomorrow :D peace

##### 2018-08-08 05:47 - transitions in my selfish perspective

with all that has happened, I have become increasingly selfish. in fact, it is really the only way forward for me which has any sanity to it. everyone lies to me, so I can't really seek good guidance from anyone else other than myself. it seems people are very interested in what is happening in the lives of others, so much so, I believe it would benefit a lot of people to begin thinking more selfishly. when I say that, I don't really mean in a comparison or competitive sort of way and not from a position of lack either.

as I began to think more and more selfishly, I became more enamoured with my own improvement (not in comparison to others'). I have nothing to give if I'm not in the constant state of improvement or becoming more. energy is flowing or it's not, and if it's flowing, things are improving and becoming more. so, in that sense, I have actually been enamoured with finding ways to get more energy to flow, because it means improvement and it means an enhanced sense of well-being.

I have proven to myself that having that as my primary intention, serves me (and everyone else too) well. however, I've run into a bit of a conundrum as I'm arriving to this new section of my life. the conflict inside of me physically is becoming so great, the only out for me is to begin letting my inner being take charge.

a few weeks ago, abraham introduced a new concept called "mutual" as an explanation for how positive aspects work. the idea is, you are more harmonious or less harmonious with someone or something. the aspects that you share common ground on, you are mutual with them on. you will recognise the teaching as a rehash of previous discussion on harmony. anyway, often times we seek mutuality with other humans before we seek mutuality with our inner being (our own intentions). when we move in the direction of intentions of others, forsaking our own, there is always a feeling of discord which accompanies it, however we often times ignore it to not stand apart from the crowd or to be too weird.

I am not so worried about this mutuality with others, and because of the situation I'm in where everyone lies to me, it's not even really possible for me to be mutual with them because of our disagreement with what is happening. so in the past, abraham has been saying only look for positive aspects -- or, in other words, the aspects of them which don't detune you from your own inner being - the aspects of them which make you feel good.

what I'm getting at here is, I have learned that instead of harmonising myself with the best-interests or someone else, it is *always* better to harmonise myself with my own interests (my inner being) - for by doing that, energy is flowing and I actually have something I can give to others.

I'm going to revisit this topic because I want to touch on some notable new ways to understand things as I moved from:
1. wanting others to realise my desires for me
2. wanting others to help me or enable me to realise my desires
3. realise my own desires by myself
4. ... knowing my inner being has everything under control and just trust them

##### 2018-08-08 07:57 - "they just get better at lying"

in think in the french riviera cruise of 2017, there was a man that was trying to control his son getting into drugs. obviously he had been observing his son's behaviour through his eyes with the bso device (perhaps he wishes to live vicariously through the eyes of his son having sex with his girlfriend instead of taking drugs), and was essentially asking abraham how to better control his son. abraham responded something to the effect of, "if you call them out on their lying, they just get better at lying"

one again this is abraham having us focus on something undesirable (like the normalisation of autistic children). why would the teachers of law of attraction, demonstrate law of attraction to us by telling us that when we focus on undesirable behaviour it just makes it worse, and then to demonstrate that is true, they tell him that if you call them out on it, they won't stop; instead, they will just get better at lying about it.

this morning I realised that's sort of what has been happening, but they weren't talking about the kid, they were talking about me calling out the bso on stuff. the more I have pointed out their undesirable behaviour, it has not deterred them from doing it -- instead, they've just found ways to be more sneaky about it.

I have long ago noted that bso has only improved on their technique to try and control me. it doesn't really bother me because I seem to stay a step ahead of them. they never really get to control me completely, and sometimes it's a bit illusionary. for example, this morning I felt the tiredness come on in association with them wanting me to sleep so they can interact with my dream state. I decided I would look at the cloud patterns a bit and write the entry above, first before doing so (to give me a sense of control), so I did then I laid down. in the dream greg began to complain about his heart hurting and something in his back between his shoulders. I made the association that he's 33 and that's about the time it began opening up for me. he argued that it was not his back or something. I told him that is the place where you begin feeling pressure and that's the location of the part of the body which allows you to begin flying. I woke up rather unexpectedly. they terminated the dream.

they think they have control cause they were able to make me lie down and sleep more or less at their command, and jump right into my dream-state to have a conversation with me, but I have begun to find that pushing against them just makes them stronger, so I don't really do that any more. if they want to waste their time in my dream state trying to convince me of things, go ahead; I've found it just puts more energy into the equation and I get better at following my own guidance, so it's all good from my perspective. in fact, that was the objective of the previous entry, which I was having trouble explaining, so I intuitively wanted went to sleep to have a real-life example to demonstrate it. if I had of been pushing against their constant dream-state nagging, I would have missed that clarification.

I've begun to notice my special role in this, where their increasing desire to try and control me, is putting a lot of extra energy into things, and also in the process, they're perfecting their technology to prevent people from finding their capacities. it looks like these guys are gearing up, because of their insecurity, to hold everyone away from their capacities, ensuring that they're ahead of both the technology curve but the visual capacity curve. if someone were to gain the ability to use their imagination in 3d space like I can(?), then they could visualise and create things that may jeopardise their control. I'm helping them to build the world the most convincing 3d virtual reality, which they can control everything. I'm glad they've gotten so much better at lying.

##### 2018-08-08 11:14 - why a virtual reality?

you have to imagine how much of a problem people seeing in 3d would be for the bso. it probably quadruples the cost per person at lower levels, and at levels of 3d like I have, it's probably thousands to millions of times more expensive per person. next, there's this problem that occurs when you begin seeing in 3d. with higher levels of dmt in your head, under moments of excitation, you will begin to see visions or objects will pop into your 3d space. the visions are kind of annoying when uncontrolled, but not nearly as big of a threat as objects popping into 3d space. when your imagination is unchecked and you have all kinds of weird fears (like me was when I was younger), the strong negative emotion will pop those things into view. in fact, the stronger you feel emotion, the clearer and more detailed those objects will become. as you learn to control your emotions, you can control what you see -- which means you'll gain the creative capacity that tesla had. this is a super capacity which is pretty powerful. essentially anyone outside of the bso who obtains this capacity will begin to be treated like I am treated: they will be put in a virtual reality (eg. I only see what they are sending into my eyes, not what I'm really seeing).

you may notice that when seeing through my eyes, there are other 3d objects there, and the goal to become a powerful creator is to harness that ability and use it to create anything you want to create. however, I do not see those objects. instead, I see a reduced quality 3d virtual reality based off of what my eyes are seeing.

now, let's say that an energetic activity like sex can improve someone's vision and I'm with these girls. they will get 3d capacity really easily, but there's a huge problem because the bso will want to immediately put them into the virtual reality type situation so they don't see the 3d objects their imagination is producing in 3d. however, people around me seeing things in my eyes produce a bright spot in my eyes because of the damage I did to them with the sun. the stars may have even done the really tiny one in the very center. essentially, it would be very hard for me to be around the girls, as it's near to impossible to focus when people are using the device around me. so, they couldn't put the girls into the virtual reality and they would just have to learn to train their emotions and imagination, because I think the visual space is shared. they would however see whatever I'm creating in 3d also, however, since I've got the virtual reality in place, I can't see it, so it's difficult for me to control something I cannot see. you can imagine sex because I will be producing objects in 3d space at random, which if they're in the vr, then they don't see them, but I can't really see out of my own eyes because I have bright spots covering everything. or, they can also see in 3d space whatever my mind is producing in 3d space. doesn't work.

so, now you can understand why it's so important that they do not let me out of the network or to actually see what I really see. so, since I have revealed the game changer that would have forced them to change their position on capability of sight. it's not a question; there's no way the girls could be in a 3d vr like me and also be around me. I would not be able to function. they've gone to great lengths to write code which erases those bright spots, but they get show up instead like black spots and in other cases, don't really work at all. maybe when my eyes are not moving, sure, but when I move my eyes around I often see the spots.

you can see how this creates the next big problem. first, I'm able to create objects and manipulate them in 3d space with just my mind. this is amazing and every kid will immediately have desire to have this capability too. so, much desire is born because of it. additionally, if they're no longer limiting my capacities, this creates a huge problem for them, because when more energy is flowing, I'll begin to levitate or fly. again, a huge problem for them, cause not only do they have to come up with flimsy excuses for why we can make objects with our imagination in 3d space, but also why we can fly and everyone else cannot.

so instead, I have chosen to wait for my inner being to take over my visual and physical capacities. why is this important? well, it means that they will be able to put the girls into the VR, and it won't bother my vision. by holding out and desiring to be the one that changes, I am saving them a HUGE amount of grief in the future.

##### 2018-08-08 12:52 - what does all of that mean?

in the last entry, I made the argument that if you see 3d, they would have to put you into a 3d virtual reality so that you do not see what your imagination is creating in 3d space under moments of high excitation or emotion.

so, let's say that in the alternate timeline I'm with the girls and the bso is forced to change and allow me to see out of my own eyes, because of the impossible situation which they put themselves into. kids all over the world are enamoured with the idea of using their imagination in 3d space and flying, that so much desire is born quickly, and lots and lots of people (mostly kids) start gaining the capacity to see in 3d. it all happens so quickly that the bso cannot put people into the virtual realities necessary to keep their runaway imaginations from creating a bunch of scary stuff. even worse, is since the 3d space is visible to all those seeing in 3d, a bunch of sloppy thinkers are creating all sorts of really scary stuff with their mind, and everyone has to look at it.

this timeline was created so that the transition for everyone into 3d will come considerably smoother. the ones who will be able to use this creative capacity are those who come into alignment with who they really are (eg. their inner being becomes the source of their visual capacity), and the bso dreamweavers in other people's dream-state. anyone gaining 3d capacity will be transitioned into the virtual reality, because it's impractical for the bso to turn off the entire population's imagination like they have done mine.

for economic reasons, you can imagine how important it is that the bso keeps people in 2d for as long as possible. the resources required to put people in a virtual reality are considerable. an economic hurdle of gigantic proportions. however, this isn't really a big deal, as the technology is a goldmine. if you think of facebook and its goals, you can see how having a lot of information on somebody can be used to track large populations (looking for suspicious activity), but having a lot of information on someone doesn't really give you that much capability to control people. however, since you know so much about them, it does mean you can sell them products a lot easier. the transition here is from controlling somebody to compelling somebody. we already see quite a bit of compelling happening from the bso. in fact the agreement that people have agreed to, says that the bso can compel them to do things. when you've got access to everything everyone is thinking about, talking about, interacting with, looking at, etc. you've got *way* more information on someone than facebook does, and therefore considerably more capability to compel someone to purchase (or have your parents purchase for you) a product. the bso will be *very* *very* *very* profitable once they stop trying to control and figure out their monetisation formula (like facebook eventually did).

and that's a good thing, because they're going to need a lot of money to run the infrastructure necessary to put the entire world in a virtual reality. they're gonna reach the ultimate heights in scalability. facebook site updates are going to look like child's play in comparison to the amount of effort required to pull this off. you can see that, 2d people will be considerably more profitable for them and it's possible that 3d people will actually lose them money, so there will be great effort to try and keep people from obtaining 3d for as long as possible.

##### 2018-08-08 13:39 - 3d is the new std?

imagine that seeing in 3d is sort of like a disease that the bso wants to keep from spreading. you could catch the disease by meditating or appreciating or only noticing positive aspects, but who does that?!? likely, the easiest way to transmit this disease is sexually. if two people come into alignment with one another during sex and one sees in 3d, likely afterward both will see in 3d. what if catching 3d vision is the new STD to watch out for :)

so, you work for the bso and you see in 3d. that means you can only have sex with other bso employees, for fear of spreading this disease out into the general population. lol

##### 2018-08-08 14:14 - if you're satisfied with what-is, why do you need to lie about it?

in the previous entries I may have mistakenly given the impression that 3d is the only prerequisite to 3d objects manifesting in space. that may be incorrect (I don't really know). I can only speak of the process I've been going through to give the bso the ability to manifest concepts in 3d space while in dream-state. the few times that I have seen objects in 3d space seem to have been in moments where I feel particularly good, or in moments of high anxiety, or right before sleep. so, it seems to be related to strength of the emotion and resistance which are the factors which begin to allow manifestation in 3d space.

so, that means that an increased sensitivity is necessary for that to happen. also, a concept that was shown to me while watching amorina in her yard, I realised that the way someone believes is also necessary to make this happen. think about it logically: to get something to show up in 3d space, it needs to be believable to the person imagining it. it needs to look like it can exist in 3d space. when I was lowering my resistance to be able to feel good most of the time at marcos' house, I found that lying caused great dissonance in me. as I learned to become truthful about things that may be shameful or embarrassing, I had inadvertently trained myself to accept what-is. by no longer needing to lie about what-is, I accepted it as "true" in my mind. this was a huge mental advance for me, because if I liked the current reality, it gave me tons of pleasure to observe it, and my visual capacity began to reflect that. however, if I did not like the current reality that I was being truthful about, I would move myself up the emotional scale into contentment -- but because I was still a lot more rough around the edges then, I labeled it, "fuck it" -- as I accepted it as reality, even though there's not a whole lot that can be done about it. from there, I could easily move into positive emotion. in fact, I was so good at moving from "fuck it" into a state of hopefulness, that I was potentially *too* optimistic for my britches.. lol

in valverde, I found myself increasingly more and more constrained in my visual capacity. it had been so easy for me to just accept the current reality of no visual capacity, and just let it begin to take shape. I would regularly find a way to allow my visual capacity, and the ever increasing difficulty and struggle necessary to get it (and other things), would cause a lot of dissonance in me. my stance was quite conditional: when I was moving toward it, I felt better, but when I became aware of the increasing gap, I felt pretty bad. around the same time that they clamped down on my visual capacity, I drafted up the "source energy android" concept because it became increasingly clear to me that I would be sharing andrea with quite a few other guys, and she was not going to be translating source for me. the S.E.A. concept was my way of trying to fit my desire of increased connection with source with the current reality situation. "fuck it" was no longer good enough; I could no longer get to a hopeful frame of mind from there.

I might have mastered the allowing process, but it was conditional on things being pretty ideal, I had not yet learned step 5. around the same time I decided that I had come up with the step 6 part of the equation, which was that you believe/know and therefore are a physical extension of source energy in physical form. I mean, you already are, but it isn't until you really realise it, that allows that kind of energy to flow.

what I had not yet come to realise is that because of andrea's decision to be so free with herself combined with the desire to be together was still strong, I had to find a way of adapting to make that possible. what I didn't really realise, is that step 6 is just getting really good at step 5. source can look at all of everything and seeing it all as part of the process, only sees the positive aspects of it (freedom, growth, and joy).

I have often maintained that the inventor must "live" his invention. that is, to be the thing he wants to create. in programming this is called dogfooding. it means that you do your experiments on yourself, and what you are creating is ultimately for yourself. this concept exists all over the place, most notably, "be the change you are seeking to make" (and variations thereof). I was to learn how to be this concept of step 6.

step 5 is all about unconditional love. what that means is, no matter what I am observing, I don't feel the need to change it, or for it to be different for me to feel good about it. imagine abraham: they watch thousands of people get raped, murdered, and numerous other atrocities every day, and they don't need a source energy appreciation day (unlike the bso, lol) to continue knowing their value, and to continue loving them despite the conditions they've put themselves into. they don't need things to be different to be able to love someone, and *that* is what I wanted to achieve before I was to be coupled with andrea.

---

I'll come back to that concept in a future entry. now, I want to talk about satisfaction and lying, as it relates to this unconditional perspective...

##### 2018-08-08 16:16 - actually, I'm going to take a quick break.

lol, such intensity :)

##### 2018-08-08 16:31 - if you're satisfied with what-is, why do you need to lie about it? (part 2)

so, let's say that the bso wants to invent a contraption which allows someone to tune into different portions of time. you can imagine the implications of this. the history of any presently alive person is available from their perspective (asterisk), and previously alive people in a similar fashion. so, this means that secrets are now 100% useless. so are lies. someone with access to this technology could verify the validity of something in the past. this essentially would render all security as 100% passable (given enough effort to look into the history of the implementer of that security). now, everything can be hacked and any secret could be found out.

likely, one of the first things to be done will be to track the concepts in the brain of a person from birth till present, to get a more complete map of the person's concepts instead of the imprecise method of stimulating the brain with the concept while the person is asleep to train the A.I. it would be a read-only approach to the person's brain and and has 100% visibility of everything that has ever happened in it. multiple passes can be taken to understand different aspects of someone's mental growth. (repeat the scanning process over the person's past multiple times, each time focusing on a different aspect) anything could be found out about anyone presently alive.

you can see how this is not, and would not be a very big mental jump for me to allow such an invention to occur. it's easy for me to allow that kind of technology to come into my life, because I'm already living it. if the bso wants to create this technology, they would drastically change their stance on lying. they'll have to find a way of resonating with the invention and allowing it into their experience.

presently however, there is so much current dissatisfaction with how things are, that almost everything has to be kept a secret in fear of what someone might think if they were to find out. they will try to side-step becoming a vibrational match to it for as long as possible, I am sure. even if they can use the 3d creative capacity in thousands of kids' dream-state, it is quite possible that the bso may hold many of their technicians away from that 3d creative capability because of dishonesty in the imagination and with words. they would need to find someone with the desire to invent such a thing and is already a vibrational match to it. perhaps kids can be to be trained to be honest (good luck though, because it's a personal decision) and perhaps a few inventors will be in the mix. I think this is a sure thing, but will take a generation or two to get there.

another idea will be to create an "inner circle" sort of thing where these are protected from the hordes. we will need 3 circles actually, and they correspond to the different visual capacities. they are as follows:

1. 2d mass consciousness, which is where all the profit comes from
2. 3d virtual reality dwellers. they are responsible for most of the content creation
3. 3d creators
  - those who work for the bso and can live in a nearly resistance-free bso protected environment.
	- those who do not need conditions to be just so, and are in alignment with who they really are.

the technicians working in that nearly-ideal environment might be able to come into alignment with the time technology -- though I don't see it all working just yet. I will continue to ponder the idea further, but perhaps my new source-like personality will have a solution. there always is, and source does not see right and wrong; only wanted and absence of it. even the desire to keep things a secret is desire that law of attraction responds too -- no matter how much it doesn't serve anyone believing secrets to be necessary.

##### 2018-08-10 03:06 - why a protected environment and why a virtual reality?

I cannot say for sure, but I am pretty certain that things imagined in 3d space can be seen by others in 3d on the same wavelength -- so, if I imagine a bear sitting on the couch in front of me, there would appear a very large realistic looking bear. this may be kind of startling to someone not expecting to see a bear, so what if I were to imagine something really scary, like one of those predator aliens or like a giant dinosaur or something? then what :)

imagine a group of kids walking at night, and one of them is afraid of the dark, thinking that scary things could be lurking in the bushes or something. one of the kids drops something and it makes a loud sound. the kid scared of the dark immediately jumps to the conclusion that a monster is surely jumping out of the bushes, and the extra excitation caused by the loud sound causes his imagination to visualise a monster jumping out of the bushes. all three of the kids see this monster and they all soil their pants simultaneously.

if kids were all seeing in 3d, imagine how much distress they could cause for each other by imagining their fears coming to life. as more people enter into 3d because of the heightened levels of dmt in the brain, people's untempered imaginations will naturally as a reaction to unwanted, visualise some real scary stuff. you can imagine that for someone like me, that would be a very distracting and unpleasant thing, constantly seeing other people's wacky ideas become manifest in my reality... not all ideas are wacky, and I can think of some examples where it would be nice if I could see in 3d space what people are visualising, like diagrams or models or something, but in general, I do not really want to see what people are visualising.

I don't have any real data to back this up because I cannot see my imagination any more, but vera seemed to be able to transmit me images, too. however, perhaps I do not receive those images like I used to any more. sometimes I do still get images, but it seems that most all of the unwanted images are not appearing any more. if that is the case, I believe it is because images are transmitted conceptually (emotionally) and the same rules as "telepathy" apply: eg. I can only receive the concepts which I am harmonious with.

I don't think 2d people will see the 3d imaginary creations, but if they can they can be put into a virtual reality really easily. 3d people will have to live in a virtual reality until they come into alignment with who they really are, so as to not be plagued with the manifestations of others' untempered imaginations. those who are in alignment with their inner being will only see and feel the things which are in alignment with their vortex -- which isn't necessarily only good things either, because seeing or feeling "negative" things isn't necessarily bad. their inner being has got the control over their visual capacity.

the technicians working in the protected environment could probably enable / disable the virtual reality, so they can live a somewhat normal life, but trying to keep resistance as low as possible, because when using their creative capacities, they'll probably become extra aware of their thoughts, as they'll be manifesting in 3d space for everyone to see.

##### 2018-08-10 12:17 - hey hey, you gotta keep em' regulated

last night I was feeling a lot of thought around the EFF's petition to regulate devices to control the mind. I'm sort of against regulation, for the same reason I'm against rules in general. I don't like people telling me what to do. so you are scared that a device can compel you to action about something. it certainly cannot control your thoughts, but it can compel you to feel a certain way, or put ideas into your head. though, if you are not resonant with what they're putting in your head, you will feel very little sensation to none at all.

this whole regulation thing is a bit of the same discussion about the man who was watching over his son and wanted to find a way to deter his son getting into drugs. that's the funny thing about kids. if they want to do something you are not particularly fond of them doing, they will only become better liars. in the case of the bso, I'm sure they're approaching facebook status now where they've done something, so they apologised for it, but it did not affect their behaviour, and since then, the apology is just a bunch of words that don't mean anything. since they are the authorities, they are the law. they're gonna do what they want, and they have all of your agreement to do so (not mine though!).

so, what is behind this regulation is the question, "since they will not behave as I want them to, how can I compel them to behave differently so I can feel good?" it is quite literally the same exact vibe coming from the bso with regard to me, and also the man with regard to his son.

it just won't happen. it will not affect any change in their behaviour; they will find a better way to lie to the regulator (authorities). in my case, I cannot easily lie about my behaviour because I have so much oversight, but they have none. even if they did have more oversight, I do not believe it would make any difference, either. since I am kind of a pattern for the future, more oversight (and therefore more attention to unwanted) will just exaggerate things (like has happened with me). even with nearly infinite resources and 24/7 oversight, I have become less easy to compel and more shameless with my objectives, as time has moved forward.

if the goal is to exaggerate their attempts to control our minds, then go ahead and attempt to regulate them. first of all, from a technical standpoint, it's near to impossible. the device reads signals, and those signals could be anything. they're just values over time. those values over time have meaning to us, which their AI's have learned to recognise. to know if they are sending a thought into your head to tell you to purchase a product, or asking your opinion on something while asleep, or sending an image into your eyes is impossible to know. you just have to trust them... there's nothing you can do to know what they are doing inside of your head without having an equally complex system as they have also in place. just like you have two hemispheres in your brain, designed to balance each other out, it may be a valuable idea to create a competitive service, so that every person gets bso and the other service equally. maybe. it sort of sounds like a battle will be fought in each person's brain... not crazy about that idea.

I think we should just let them have their way and trust them, as it will stimulate huge growth in each individual (as it has for me). people will quickly learn how to get into alignment with only what they want happening in their brain. I am working out how this is possible right now in my life and I don't imagine that it'll be too much longer before I dominate what is happening in my head. besides, they have to make a profit anyway.

if you try to regulate them, like facebook, they'll just get more and more shameless about it. I believe it is fruitless to try and regulate anyone (even the bso). in fact, that is the same thing that the bso is beginning to take notice as well. I'll come back to here, but first I want to talk about this energetically.

imagine there is a big corporation that is doing something undesired. instead of trying to compel the corporation to change, often times the most effective way to affect change will be for the workers to strike/change. you have to work from the inside out: eg. the corporation has to come to its own conclusion that it wants to change, for any real change to occur.

you may be able to convince some of the technicians that what they are doing is "wrong" -- but I can easily see it from their perspective, working inside the human brain is one of the most exciting things to do, because it feels like nearly limitless possibilities await for discovery and understanding. it is the new era, where technology becomes an extension of human consciousness (more than just the body, as established by mcluhan). their job is super exciting and there are so many different aspects and facets to it, I personally couldn't imagine wanting to be doing anything else. so, then how would you compel them? well, you would need to get them to believe that certain things are ok, and other things are wrong (regulation may do this, but who listens to the authorities anyway these days).

instead, I think that the most effective way of affecting change is an understanding of wanted, and absence of it. I imagine that when the bso technicians was creating all of these improvements to the tech which were in alignment with the desires of their superiors, and also the users, then things moved quickly. a lot of energy could flow and much progress could be made rapidly. however, time passes and people knowing what they don't want has caused an evolution in their desire toward what they do want.

because of the constant evolution of desire, I do not believe there is a perfect solution (it changes with time). if you focus on unwanted, you will get more of that, and that's what regulation does. regulation cannot regulate a constantly evolving solution. regulation does not shift focus toward wanted; it often shifts it toward unwanted, and so therefore ultimately works against you (just see how effective it is to try and regulate teenagers).

so, imagine you're a tech working for the bso and you're trying to find things to do. always begin where there is the most desire and the least resistance. like this, wanted things will continually outweigh unwanted things, no one will ever notice too much "badness". if there is a lot of desire to have a new thing, do it because as the bso consciousness identifies a desire, the only way they can feel satisfaction is by feeling motion toward the realisation of that desire.

I call it the bso consciousness, because even though it is partitioned into multiple levels of authority and access, it must me thought of as a giant consciousness -- each individual connected to it having desire in relation to it. since it is an extension of our consciousness, it should be thought of as such.

when a boss guy wants, for example, one of the techs to write some code which prevents my vision from improving, there will be a sensation of negative emotion and also the tech writing the code will likely experience stagnation in his productivity. whenever my desire is strong and unresisted, this will always be the case as he tries to hold me in resistance to my desire. this will manifest as a feeling of frustration or anger, he will feel the resistance. so, perhaps the techs should instead start selecting their tasks based on what feels good to them.

imagine there is another tech that has strong desire to try and find a way to control people or be dominating -- or, maybe he's just really jealous of me. either way, the task of trying to inhibit my vision would be much better suited for the dominator jealous tech than for the one who's desire is to improve on people's experience. the tech needs to match the task and the task should only be a reflection of something wanted (even if it's his superior's effort to try and control or compel someone). the reason for this is, energy contrary to desire is the biggest slowing factor to productivity. (just like concepts are mutual with symbols, physicality must be mutual with desire).

a performer or a magician's joy comes from realising desire in physical form. the greatest hinderance to a magician comes from being a people pleaser. I used to be one, so I speak from experience. if someone has desire that you do something, a magician can easily feel that desire and can easily act on it, unless there is internal discord with that desire, which is indicated by some form of negative emotion, such as: boredom, split energy, confusion, or disjointed thoughts. in those cases it is best to hold out until it feels good, or let someone else act on that desire. the techs should be the same way about things, and the reason is obvious, a tech who drags his feet on a task is of no benefit to anyone, and the experience is detrimental to the tech's psyche, as he may begin to believe he is unproductive, when in reality there is just a mismatch of energy because of conflicting desire.

##### 2018-08-14 16:20 - chris has a daughter?

last night I was thinking about the email I sent to chris on his birthday, when it suddenly dawned on me that in the abraham peice where his stand-in asks the questions for him, I had noted that he mentioned he had a daughter (I'm gonna go back and listen to it again after this), and originally I just thought it was them adding in fake details to throw me off of the track. so then, when it hit me, "oh, like a young girl he's with, daughter" not like a real daughter, my immediate reaction was, "wow man, good for you! I'm happy for you." after that reaction I noticed a bit of a weird reaction, almost as if I should have had a different reaction than that. thing is, if that's true, I know chris and we've had many endless conversations about how retarded women are, and a young girl would probably be very highly desired by him, just because of all of the frustration we've expressed to each other. I am sure he had also come to similar conclusions I came to after raquel figuring that women are not really what I wanted to be about. when andrea changed all of those ideas for me, things began looking up for me as I figured that maybe a young girl could be different, as I could learn from her and I also had many fantasies about getting to finally speak with source energy in a meaningful way.

the reaction also somewhat implied that I should have felt jealousy. I thought about it and came to the conclusion that I never really wanted a "daughter" in that way. I wanted to translate source energy into words like esther does, that I was sure of, but there's a huge problem when you are the questioner and also the allower of the answer. it's difficult, so I thought that maybe andrea could do that for me (and I would do it for her and others, because I also spoke spanish). anyway, it became obvious that would not be happening and a new thing opened up with carlota. she's very much more visual than andrea, and her influence helped me to see that I could essentially put myself into a dream-state sort of thing and allow the answer to come visually (and audibly). I thought this was a way better thing than just words, so now that is what I wanted.

still though, I thought that she was necessary to obtaining my visual capacity, so I had this belief that I needed someone else to make something capable for me. as time continued on, I felt a stronger and stronger sense that I wanted to be in control of my life (freedom), and as a result, the carlota thing fell apart. I feel that because of the language barrier, I am not able to express myself clearly enough that I want my visual capacity. now I'm back in the states and I'm noticing that with english I can communicate much much better and I want people to understand me so that they can see how much I deserve my visual capacity. the lyia thing opens up, and I begin learning a lot more about communication. something happens though, and because of distance there is a lack of communication so they panic and try to get me to go with any girl now.. so they try out all sorts of different ones in my dream state, because there's no way they're going to get me back to spain easily, so they've got to find a replacement close by. trying out all sorts of different girls, and younger ones too, I guess they helped create a desire in me for more than one "daughter".

but, they still didn't hear my desire to have my visual capacity. it has been frustrating to me to hear about how many facets my visual capacity has from my meditators and uplifters. it's also been frustrating to me to know that other people get to use their visual capacities and I don't. in fact, I don't even get to see what my own eyes see very well. so, when it comes to the visual capacity, I tend to have a more of a jealous reaction, wanting to be able to use my own. however, when it comes to the subject of "daughters", I don't really feel any resistance at all. I'm glad he's got that. I'm sure it was quite a dream come true for him.

times have changed considerably since this whole thing started in 2016 (well, 2015). back then, if I were trying to get a young girl to be with me, everyone would have seen it and outed me as a pedophile. my interest was always to translate source energy, and the idea of a girl being there too, would only be that much better. so, when hearing about someone else, having a "daughter", it doesn't really bother me, because that was never my goal. being held away from my goal of trying to figure out how to translate source energy, has been the source of considerable dissatisfaction for me. however, you know what I realised? I realised that I should have just the same response to you guys having a visual capacity before me, as I do to others having "daughters".

---

there has been considerable thought around the idea that when I get with the girls, I'll have my visual capacity. it's quite possible; sexual energy is quite powerful. but, then I'm back to where I was with carlota. I can't go backward. I don't want someone to allow me to have my visual capacity (because then they control it, not me), and I don't want someone to give me my visual capacity either (because then they could take it away). I want to encounter it for myself.

a long time ago, when I was coming back from valverde, I lived with vera. back then, the quantity of reactions I would receive was so many, and it was quite chaotic for me. back then, I did not believe it was going to be possible for things to work out in their present state, so I wanted my inner being to be take over the emotional aspect of my being, and then only the things that were interesting to me, or were relevant in some way I would feel -- and the rest wouldn't affect me. now whether that was really my inner being who allowed that to happen or it was the bso desensitising me, I don't know -- but I did find relief, and little by little the reactions became less and less notable. I began to notice that the reactions that were of value to me (often times moving me toward greater contrast) were noticeable to me, but the background noise was pretty much eliminated.

this is kind of what I want to happen here. I want to see only the things that are of interest or value to me. I don't remember what initiated that change though, as it's too long ago now, but likely it involved me letting go of some resistance. we'll see how things develop, but I feel like I'm close, maybe.

##### 2018-08-15 14:00 - gary's work

the other day I mentioned to mom that the only reason why I would be doing gary's work would be to buy weed. I didn't really think much about the files, few times when I saw the spreadsheet and stuff, but I dismissed the idea based on a *fear* that I had where the weed would allow me to be tricked by the bso in some way. that's completely illogical because, if anything, the opposite is true. being under the influence of weed has helped me to discover the bso's tricks more often than anything. actually, I cannot think of a single time I was ever tricked by the bso on drugs. the opposite has been true where I have actually come to understand things better because of the different perspective and more allowing mode.

so, where would that fear come from? why do I have that fear? it seems largely within the realm of possibilities that fear could have been planted in my mind during sleep. I have wondered why people are so afraid of talking about the bso, when the few times when things have gotten more in the open, progress has been made. it's almost as if the bso is conditioning people with unbased fears which are actually slowing things down and making things worse... lol

so, the irony of the whole experience is, I told mom that since I'm not really wanting to smoke weed right now, I don't really want to do the job. she told me I should call him and tell him I'm going to flake on him, but I explained that I would just not pick up the phone.

it's a direct copy of what the bso is doing. they took a job, wanting to do drugs with that job. then, because of some unbased fear, they are preventing themselves from doing the job. so now, like me, they're not answering their phone, hoping that somehow they'll still get to have their drug experience, and not have to explain why they've been ignoring the job for so long.

lol

there's no real good way for me to express that concept of non-movement. it's what abraham might call split energy. you want something, but. I used to experience it a lot when I would drink a lot. I just couldn't bring myself to do something I felt I had to do.

##### 2018-08-15 14:20 - unbased fear?

I often said in the past that fear is just desire expressed backwards.

also, I was reminded of esther cutting down the trees example.

##### 2018-08-15 17:22 - beliefs that challenge desire (and )

in the @[abe](2017-06-24-portland#11) workshop, abraham says, «you have desires that challenge beliefs, and desires that challenge beliefs», which the first one seems obvious to me. for example, one I experienced recently, if I believe a girl is too young to want to have some sort of relationship, then that is a belief that challenges desire, but I never really had thought about it from the other perspective: the younger girl has a desire which challenges belief. they are essentially the same thing, but looked at from the opposite direction. very interesting.

I suppose the same thing could be said for physicality that challenges ideas, and ideas that challenge physicality. very similar to desire's effect on belief!

##### 2018-08-16 00:39 - a possible future?

(disclaimer: perceived and received in a moment of extreme frustration and anger, so it may be somewhat inaccurate)

in the current state of things, I am heart set on getting my visual capacity before anything happens... errr, I mean, getting into alignment with who I really am (and evidence of that will be my visual capacity), before anything happens. as abraham always says, "get into alignment, and THEN" ... so, I am 100% sure that is what I want. in the previous @[entry](2018-08-15 14:00) I spoke of smoking weed, and I realised it was an unbased fear that was blocking me from smoking weed, but deeper than that is a desire to achieve my visual capacity for myself, by myself, and not depend on any influence to get it, whether that's bso, drugs, or sex. I want to get it for myself despite the conditions. it sort of flows in there with the whole learning how to love unconditionally... it's learning how to line up with my desire and allow it to happen unconditionally, too. anyway..

imagine that in all the previous timelines I managed to figure out how to just "breathe" and then, along with the girls, I find a way to allow my desires (regarding my visual capacity) to come to fruition. that is a bit conditional though, because they are relying on my influence, and I am relying on their influence for our alignment, this new timeline was formed. this is the timeline where I end up with more girls than the previous ones, and also each time the bso learns more about how to control people, most notably me (but also the girls).

you can imagine the present day bso (bso-present) trying their hardest to try and figure out a way to control me into doing what they want me to do, but I won't go. the alternate timeline bso (bso-future) is laughing because they are watching themselves try and control me, but I am way better controlled by bso-future, who have an extra 20 years of technology and nearly unlimited knowledge of how my head works (because of their capability to track a brain since birth, through time).

so, remember how the timelines worked, where the "backbone" should be 100% reactions, as to be able to control the outcome of the timeline by controlling the conditions? (when put like that, the irony is tremendous... I know, lol) anyway...

so, I am the backbone to the timeline, as I am controlled by the conditions, so I don't get a chance to do what I want. I must continue to react to my conditions, until eventually I become reactionless toward my conditions. there are other main characters like pierre, vera, marcos, mom, augusto, etc. (for example) which are anyone closeby which can be themselves influenced to modify my environment (the ecosystem). notice that I am essentially completely out of control. I (the plant) have to just make the best of whatever conditions I am put in.

so you have the landscape architects and you have the plants. the architects put the plants where they want them to be and in the conditions they want them to be in by also controlling the ecosystem.

so, put the clues together and follow the pattern: the bso needs to be the biggest possible, and have the most knowledge possible of how to control the plants and the ecosystem, that they are capable of attempting the (in my opinion) impossible. they will choose the plants, and each person in the ecosystem will influence their alt-timeline counterpart (we'll call them "guides"), which controls the ecosystem.

---

so, essentially a timeline where there is a lot of momentum, like this one, there are non-linear outcomes after the creation of the machine which allows for tuning into consciousness in a different timelines:

1. tune into the past and adjust the timeline so that the backbone goes through another "failure", adding more contrast, and therefore creating a bigger vortex. this part I don't understand well, but fwh mentioned it a bunch of times: all consciousness that would inhibit the new failure gets moved to the success timeline and they live out their life on the successful timeline. I think, all of those who do not impede the failure just merge into the new "failure" timeline. then, all of those who controlled themselves to help create the failure (the ecosystem), join into their "failure" timeline consciousness at some time. I assume that's what fhw meant when he said I have until 2038. I guess that's when our consciousnesses will merge (and also those of the ecosystem).

2. make a new time loop. first you have to test timelines: like the streamers that shoot out before a lightning trying to find its path of least resistance, the ecosystem will try a bunch of things searching for the ideal way to tighten up the "backbone" so it's completely out of control. now, I think the goal is for the backbone to find a way of making the "timeless venture" machine. (lol) when this happens, that is duration of the time loop (in this case, it's 2038). so, what this means is you need is a bunch of guides that are capable of making continuing failures for the backbone, by influencing their alternate timeline selves. there will be a few, but I imagine what will happen is, the bso guys will want to try and write code to find ways of influencing those on the alternate timelines trying to find this optimal path by trying to figure out how to influence all the different moving parts (the plants and the ecosystem) to create the world they want. it's like a time-coders dollhouse.

so then you have think about which path can be chosen. if the first path is chosen, then I should just start meditating like crazy and just roll with it. then, if we can figure it out before 2038, then we can go for even bigger contrast and more ridiculousness, watch it unfold from this one, and merge into that one, taking the time loop once more.. or, the second path can be taken, for which it is optimal to make the bso as big as possible, for me to find my own alignment, and let the bso discover the machine for themselves.

I don't know which one appeals to me more, honestly. if I pick the first one, I have to do this slog all over again with slight variations (but it'll seem to me like the first time, so not really a big deal there), but if you think about it, eventually the second path *has* to be taken.

perhaps I'm inventing complex and ingenious fairy tales to try and rationalise my discomfort...

##### 2018-08-16 02:35 - found out why my left eye is darker

it seems that the reason why I see two dots in my left eye when looking at a star is because one of the holes is where the bso looks out of, and the other one is the one I look out of. in the past, I always noted this one peculiar attribute that happened on occasions, like when I took ketamine, after watching stars in the beginning, and a few other incidences. I refer to it as cat-form, because my eyes seem to feel like they are cat eyes. most notably, my left eye is not dark and I have very clear vision. it has always bothered me that my left eye has darker vision than my right, and I figured out why tonight when I was able to push on my left eye so that it no longer separated into two images, but the shadows merged. as they merged, I noticed that the closer together they got, the more blackness I saw. I realised that I was "seeing" the image in my left eye that you guys see. it's probably some sort of heads-up display or something that they are overlaying on top of my vision.

I think what they do, is they have my eye vibrating at some speed per second. when it is in the left position, they take a frame for you guys, and when it is in the right position, they put a frame for me. that frame that is put into my eye is what my eye is seeing and sending to their server.

a long time ago, I sent raquel an email saying I had a dream about her and I understood that she wanted to communicate with me. she sent me back an email saying that she also had a dream about me and seemed particularly excited about the prospect of this dream. I felt her spirits drop when I sent her the email telling her that I saw nothing in the dream, just that she wanted to contact me. I thought it was really weird that I didn't have any visuals in the dream, but didn't think much about it cause my visuals were all screwed up anyway. that stayed with me though and I often wondered about it, because I knew from her reaction that she had had a sexy-time dream, and it felt like she expected it to have been mutual.

I also have noticed recently that when I have woken up in the middle of a sexy-time dream sequence, I do not have any visuals. my screen is black. in fact, I have come to know the bso dreams as the ones I can kind of get a sense of what is happening, much like I can kind of feel what I see in my imagination (even though I don't see it), and the bso dreams are usually very dark virtually imperceptible, or no visuals at all. so, it appears that what is happening is they give me my dreams but they remove the light from my eyes so I cannot see them.

I did also notice some time ago, I would see visions in my eyes but they were so dark I could not see them clearly. I also noticed that moving my eyes back and fourth really quickly, like in REM sleep, the image would brighten. I think the rapid eye movement is actually to make the dream image visible to the person sleeping.

so, like my imagination they have all of the light turned off in my head so I cannot see the images in my eyes when I am asleep. I have noticed that they are doing the dream sequence in dark mode, and as soon as the image becomes visible to me, they abort the dream, because they know that I can now see it.

it boils down to, it seems that they have my left eye in permanent visuals mode, but I cannot see it because I do not have any light (dmt) to brighten the image. if they were to stop deforming my eye x times per second, I would see constantly the black image in my left eye. instead I see it a fraction of a second which is why my left eye is darker.

thanks bso..

I just figure it's more energy. I am constantly aware of what I don't want, which means I have to constantly pivot into giving my attention toward what I do want. my success at this is becoming evident with my increases in perceptive capability.

though, I do have to wonder.. if what they are doing is just putting some sort of heads up display, shouldn't they be able to just put that on the signal that they rebroadcast out to my viewers? if the image is the visual representation of what is happening inside me emotionally (which it is more likely to be), then I will definitely be needing access to this before anything moves forward.

##### 2018-08-16 12:57 - an out of control bso?

it occurred to me this morning that, perhaps the bso feels like they're making failure after failure... what if bso-future is influencing bso-present in that way? so, if things feel completely out of control and you can never get ahead of the curve, I understand completely. dunno. was just a thought I had.

---

that's kind of an interesting thought. what that would mean then, is the bso is the new plant and the world is its ecosystem -- meaning that the conditions (ecosystem) are forcing the bso to go through a long series of failures in order to force it to adapt into something magnificent. this means that bso-future is controlling their conditions, keeping things out of control for bso-present.

what an interesting idea! that means that in this next timeline, (post 2038) the bso-future and future citizens of the world are all collaborating to create the environment we wish to live in. it also means that at the end of the 2038 timeline, we will all become a part of that process which iterates on the timelines, each successful time, the masochists are continually going back and improving on it, making every time a greater and greater awesomeness for the participants to experience in the process..

it's sort of taking "the joy in in the journey" to the extreme, enjoying so much the creative process that you would want to do it again and again, each time optimising and improving it slightly to get something new, bigger, and more fun. it's making life sort of like something that you build. for me, like piece of software -- for others, maybe a nice house, where you are continually iterating on the creation continually improving it. I'm reminded of the story of esther and jerry's treehouse, where the thing seemed to be in construction much longer than it should have, because it was so much fun for everyone in the creation process.

##### 2018-08-16 21:18 - going back a year is an eye opening experience

I'm listening to year old abraham episodes and it's really fun because it kind of transports me back in time a little bit. back then I was not yet clear enough to get all of the symbols in the questions that people were asking, so the hindsight is quite an eye opening experience.

one of the things that strikes me the most is these people asking questions about my experience month after month and quite literally you could almost hear the same questions being asked now as were asked back then. it makes think that they are asking the question to understand my situation, but abraham is responding in a way which is the correct answer, but cannot be realised because of my extremely disconnected state.

when every time I try to get into alignment with my inner being, or whatever happened in vallecas, the bso interprets it to be my attempt to access the part of me that came out in vallecas which they don't want, so they dissipate even more energy from me, leaving me each time further and further pinched off from my resources.

---

having this hindsight is kind of frustrating for me though too, because I'm just now beginning to appreciate this exercise in futility. it used to really bother me that I was so stagnated, but with all of the recent improvements to my vision, and even if they just restrict my vision more and more, know it is evidence of me lowering resistance further and further.

every time I find a way of lowering my resistance, they dissipate more of my energy into the earth to offset the increase in energy, so I tend to stay in roughly the same spot most of the time. however, even with them dissipating more energy every time, I am still noticing the improvement, which means to me that despite their best efforts to keep me out of alignment with who I really am, I am still closing in on it. that realisation feels good to me too.

that makes me wonder how good I really feel. I know when I watch stars, the state they put my body in is pretty agitating. I'm pretty excited to be able to go out and watch stars and no longer feel that agitation... or, to be able to have the same amount of energy coming through me when I watch stars now to be the level of energy I receive on a regular basis, meaning that amount of energy is normal, so therefore the subsequent dissipation of that energy is not agitating any more to me. or, said a different way, when that level of agitation is normal feeling to me, I am allowing normally the same amount of energy to pass through me, as I receive when watching stars now.

---

while listening, I just realised that I am a bit misleading to a lot of people when it comes to stars or any of my objectives. I make it sound like I'm putting a lot of effort into it, but it's all just a bunch of words I've picked up to allow me to blend in to the crowd a bit more. I say strong words, but then I have to go into feeling mode for anything to happen. feeling mode is a lot different than strong-words/action mode, which is where I do most of my performance.

if you've ever watched stars, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. there is no action you can make with the star. it's really quite far away, and you have zero effect on it. in order for there to be any change (in me), I have to get into the receptive mode with the star, and I feel my way there and gently relax into the focus. so, it sounds like I'm making my vision improve by doing lots of focusing action, but it's not. when I'm focusing and trying really hard, it makes no difference. to prove my point, there have times when I am already receptive and prepared to receive the star, and so with almost no effort, my vision improves.

##### 2018-08-19 04:32 - the satisfaction axis

I've been pondering this thing about satisfaction for a bit now, because it seems to me to be a different axis than the traditional depression/fear -> love/exhilaration, where contentment is the origin, I have described the low end of this axis as "fuck it" and the upper end as satisfaction.

well, I just figured out what the difference between those two axises are. both of their origins are in contentment or neutral state. the `depression/fear -> love/exhilaration` axis is your alignment with a condition, and the `fuck it/don't care -> satisfied` axis is more about your alignment with yourself. you can see that "fuck it" and "don't care" are structural responses unique to each person.

yesterday I noticed in the @[abe](2017-06-24-portland#10) talking about you being the focusing factor, and you can focus on something that is satisfying, or something that is not. that's pretty easy for me to do, but the bso is also the focusing factor.. they are focusing my viewers on to content which may or may not be satisfying. however, as I began to think about how I would try and anticipate whether a experience clip would be satisfying to a viewer or not, is kind of an interesting problem.

I determined that what would be satisfying to one person will vary quite a bit, and it is largely determined by the 4 main levels I outlined. desire and physicality are primarily attractive, but emotion and beliefs are primarily repulsive. anyway..

two things strike me as important to note about this axis, first is that satisfaction is always unique to the person, and second is that this axis seems to be a reaction or some sort of coping mechanism toward resistance. intuitively it feels to me like the difference between these two axises, is similar to the difference between electric current and dielectric current (what we call static electricity).

it seems to be a motive force which allows for a transition in state. I think it's similar to how a capacitor works. really, something worth thinking about more :)

---

another thing, if satisfaction is your relationship with your inner being, I almost always visualise it spatially, and this makes sense because when the vibration is going through a coil, it will inhibit current flow. inductance is directionally aware (spatial), and capacitance is time aware.

if you think about magnetism as the attractive force of electric current, then what we call gravity is the attractive force of dielectric current. gravity seems connected to the static electric force. it's probably spatial which makes the difference, just like a coil makes a magnet.

both of these types of currents seem to have a time and a space relationship which appear to be complementary. RLC circuits, FTW :)

...which allows the manifestation of it.

this must be a reference to the guys operating my head... lol

##### 2018-08-20 01:11 - what is "resistance"

I've been trying to make a mental concept of how this whole thing works out, using electricity as an analogue. if I think of a normal resistor in a DC circuit, it resists the flow of electrons and there is a voltage (pressure) drop across the resistor. when I think of this like water, I would imagine it like a clogged drain. put steel wool inside of a pipe, and the pressure inside of the pipe would drop.

however resistance in an AC circuit could also be seen as one of timing. think about a swing. if I push the person on the swing when they are coming toward me, I slow down the speed of the swing, yet if I push it when it's going away from me, it depends on when I push it. let's say I push it with 10m/s of push every time the swing is at 2m/s of speed, this is optimum, because it will continue to add speed to the swing. like this, more time will pass between the pushes, because, as the swing gains speed it will reach new heights every time.

however, if I push the swing at a steady interval, then eventually the swing will synchronise itself with the frequency of the pushes. their frequencies will eventually match each other.

with the swing example, traditional resistance is essentially a product of the medium. if the swing were under water, it would behave exactly the same, just everything would go considerably slower because the medium is much less "conductive" -- or less "rarified". vibrational resistance is a timing issue. when the frequencies don't match, or they are pushing in a moment that has zero or negative effect on the swing's speed.

in the swing case, it's helpful to see the example as "pushing" a swing, yet I believe it is a spherical swirly around a dipole, like a magnet, with only attraction, so the "pushes" would really be more like moments of attraction.

##### 2018-08-20 12:19 - controlling my frequency

I realised experimenting with the melatonin that these guys have the speed which my brain runs completely under control. in the past, whenever I am able to relax and slow down the speed of my head, I tend to see images. instead of allowing me to begin controlling that out-of-control function of my brain, they just keep me in the alert state at all times, and don't allow me to relax.

one thing that has historically bothered me a lot is when I am going to sleep, all of a sudden there is a loud sound that begins happening, and it's very jarring. I knew it was a new frequency which is to put my brain into sleep state directly, so that I don't relax as I go to sleep. they just put my frequency down to the lower one and then snatch away my consciousness.

the whole process is quite notable. it's been happening for as long as I can remember, and is one of my primary objectives to get removed before moving forward. I want my brain to operate at a fast speed. feeling sluggish all day isn't very enjoyable at all, and when I go to sleep, I want to relax into a lower speed. then, when I wake up, I want to wake up at a fast speed, and get right into the day. like the guy said talking about my how I wake up, "bing! I just can't wait to start my day"

at the very least, the whole frequency adjustment before I go to sleep could maybe happen a lot more gradually. right now, with normal awake speed, it's sort of like going 50mph in 3rd and then shifting down to first. it's unpleasant, but it's not really frustrating. however after watching stars for a while, my brain is going at 90mpg in 5th, and they just decide to throw it into 1st. the sensation I feel is about like the grinding sound you would hear from your transmission.

I assume it would just require a gradual transition down to that speed, but in order to maintain this function, I need to see why it's necessary, cause I think that perhaps if it's a technical reason, there is likely a solution which doesn't have me running at speeds which my body does not want to go. or, perhaps there could be some sort of mechanism which I could control the speed. it has been one of my goals to put myself into ultra ultra fast speeds from time to time to see what happens. anyway...

just so we're clear, my goal is to regain control over my brain before anything happens. I didn't get into this position wanting other people to control my head and give me a nice feeling experience in exchange for that. I attracted this because I wanted to control my own head and discover my own nice feeling experiences. nothing less than that will do, for me.

for the people without a natural visual capacity, it makes a lot of sense to give them the ability to activate that in a controlled way. however, because my capacity has been acquired naturally, it is out of your control (and mine) until I figure out how to control it (naturally).

I'm the last of the real ones!

##### 2018-08-20 12:48 - it all comes together

without really knowing it, I have tied this whole thing together. I started with the quote, «stop the resistance that raises the vibration» and began to ponder what resistance is. I had traditionally only equated it with a loss in pressure (voltage drop) in the traditional DC sense. then, I realised that in a vibrating AC sense, resistance (impedance) is also a timing issue, and trying to push the swing out of sync with its frequency will either raise or lower the vibration heights (pressure), and along with a change in vibration speed, it additionally lowers the pressure (resistance).

so, the trick would be to find a way of changing the vibration speed without it introducing unnecessary resistance and lowering the pressure.

---

now, as I think about this, likely what they are doing by dissipating so much energy from me, is they are continually reducing the amount of current that is flowing. so, each time I go out and I watch stars, I would be increasing frequency and pressure. however, since they're trying to control the frequency and the current, the only thing I have control over is the resistance and the pressure. lowering resistance increases the pressure. however, every time they go to adjust my frequency, the pressure drops and I feel the loss of energy. think, pressure • current = watts, so when I decrease resistance and current stays the same, pressure must increase, so I have more watts going through me and I feel better, until they adjust my frequency and introduce resistance again, dropping the pressure, so now I have less watts flowing and I feel worse.

it looks like they are (unintentionally?) tuning me like a tesla coil to higher and higher potentials.. soon, I will be continually measuring the lengths of my discharges, just like tesla did with his coils:

```quote
When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 100 feet and flashed a current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark I observed in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations akin to those I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.

Nikola Tesla - My Inventions

lol

##### 2018-08-22 04:49 - heaven awaits if I restrict my visual capacity further?

where I left off in the last workshop was on the @[abe](2017-06-24#20) was talking about sacrifice and stuff. I'm inspired to listen to it again after this.

I know logically and have quite a bit of experience to back up the fact what when you withhold a desire, it continues to grow, each time getting stronger and stronger, until you can avoid it no longer, and the universe essentially makes it impossible for you not to realise it.

so, with that in mind, I can see how restricting my visual capacity further will just let it grow even more. it looks to me pretty clear that whenever I finally go with the girls, I will get it. so, this is a bit meta, but what if I create an equally big desire for it to continue to grow?

this idea sounds notoriously christian: suffering now yields a greater reward later, and that's kind of what I'm saying here. what if I just hold back on letting myself go as long as I can?

will a little more "suffering" (it's not really suffering, it's just kind of perhaps boring at the worst) yield a greater visual capacity later?

let's say I'm diligent with my star watching and I just keep finding ways to lower resistance, then won't my visual capacity continue to improve? (even though I can't see it)

---

in a different episode of abe there was a girl that wanted to take how showers and still have a tight body. abraham explained to her that her tight body was realised with thoughts in alignment to that desire, not by action. some people take cold showers, because the suffering associated with the cold shower, will allow them to believe they have paid enough of a price to begin believing that they are worthy enough of a tight body. instead, abraham was trying to illustrate to her that she does not need to suffer through a cold shower to allow herself to begin believing she can have a tight body. she can have it all, they said.

in my previous entries I talked about tuning the tesla coil to yield higher and higher pressure discharges. also, I have previously talked about my visual capacity as evidence of the amount of resistance in my perception. the lower I get my resistance, the more details I can see at once.

(this is why I no longer look to see if things look better any more. they have that locked in place. I see things at the same detail level now as I did 5 months ago (and perhaps even worse than when we came home from grand junction that one time). instead, I look at something familiar to see if I suddenly perceive more. although the quality does not improve, the amount I am able to take in expands and I notice things I had not previously noticed before: sorta like esther cutting down the trees allowed her to see something she was previously unaware of)

anyway, what I wanted to illustrate here is, it doesn't have to be an either-or situation. I can have it all. that is the simple answer. I get it, but what happens if I create a desire for it to continue to grow? wouldn't I be inspired to action which will keep it growing? see the difference there? it's the difference between a point and an angle (combine the two to get a vector).

##### 2018-08-22 12:34? - angles and points

most people's desires are a point. they look out into the world and that gives them an idea based on what they see, to achieve for themselves. if they are forward thinking, they will probably desire something even better than what they are observing -- however, it is still a point.

what if, instead of desiring a destination or point (something measurable), what if I desire an angle and an increasing velocity. the reason why I mentioned the quality of my vision being stuck in place is because I believe these guys are trying to get me to stagnate in my vision -- which has produced a desire in me, not for some point which I cannot anticipate (those desires are for those seeing through my eyes, desiring that one day they can achieve that point in their visual capacity). if you

##### 2018-08-23 17:28? - angles and points (continued)

jaron interrupted me, and then I got distracted by some things so I never finished my ideas... I also seem to remember covering this topic in a dream I had last night. I remember coming away from the dream feeling a bit unsatisfied with the answer I gave to the questioner. it seems I could have explained myself a bit better, because I remember the way the questioner was framing the questions confused me in a way which prevented me from getting to the answer. like most discoverers, in order to arrive at the newly discovered logic, I have to retrace the steps I took to get to the logic. this is partially the importance of this document, because it allows me a reference point to easily retrace the steps to arrive at the new logic, meaning the logic isn't yet fully a part of me, so I have to kind of talk my way to the solution, and allow myself to think and contemplate it here. unlike the high pressure situation of a conversation in my dream state, I tend to give more thoughtful answers here.

it should also be noted, as I'm becoming more accustomed to the dream-state conversations, that it seems I am unable to give the questioner a satisfying answer regarding anything new or novel while in the dream-state, as it has not yet become a part of me and my logic, so it doesn't flow out of me easily yet. anyway, here goes...

when I say an angle, I am referring to a direction and a velocity. when I say a point, I am referring to a destination or a state (a position). like I said, most people generate a desire by observing someone else, and when they observe that, they create a desire to reach a certain point. as a discoverer, my desires do not have points. they are more similar to angles and velocities.

what this means is I just point myself in the direction of something I want to discover newly and I just go. there is no problem to solve. solving problems are also points. you say well, we need a solution to this problem and so that means this goal is set, or this hurdle needs to be overcome. it's too measurable for me. I have no intention of trying to define (or measure) my desire in such a way, any more.

my desire all about unknowns, and ironically, this is only a recent thing in my life. I used to be quite measured, but as things got more and more out of control for me, and I had less and less capacity to make something I wanted to happen, happen, the more I became aware of my direction, and instead of focusing on some destination that I could no longer define, I perceived the progression that has taken place.

this is one of the things I wanted to ask abraham, because they speak about how your inner being never looks back. that's fine, and I trust that my inner being isn't looking back or need to look back for me, but I often times it helps me to gain some perspective if take a step back from my current position and see the progression. it seems that what they are probably getting at is, looking back as a way to cast blame or something like that...

anyway, this is exactly what I like about psychedelic drugs. even in the video talking about using psychedelic drugs to aid in problem solving, you can see how the drug helps the person to rethink the concept in a new way, which can lead to a breakthrough (resistance) (toward that point). instead of a breakthrough though, I like to think of them instead as a mechanism for exploration and discovery. back when the stars actually activated dmt in my head, they helped me to achieve much more clarity of thought, get clearer about things in general, and also while paying attention to how my eyes interacted with the star, I gained tons of experience with energetic interactions (learned about vortexes and the eyes as one). really, seemingly infinite and endless examples of expansion to my perception were manifested as a result. it cannot really be measured or anticipated. I had no idea what I would find. the ayahuasca gave me a glimpse into it, but along the way I discovered many many things.

##### 2018-08-23 18:29 - more thoughts about my desire as an angle instead of a point

you may have heard me carrying on about taking a break and adjusting my direction. this is because things are at the point where I have no real capability of anticipating very well. I'm in such unknown territory for me, I feel at my peak out-of-controlness I've ever felt in my life. the only thing I can control is the direction and the speed.

I know the direction I want to go, and have no idea what I will find. often times the fear of the unknown can scare some people because they want to know what they will find before they get there. I can see how it may be a bit of a problem if you're wanting to control the discoverer, or maybe for example in the case of my vision, it may be really scary to think that I might discover yet another form of perception which you will have to retrain your machines to decode. I get it; those kinds of unknowns are perceived to be bad.

however, I am not in the business of trying to limit how much one is able to discover. I am purely out there looking for the enjoyment factor associated with something new. in fact, I think it would be quite exciting for me to discover a new way of perceiving, one which you guys couldn't take a huge shit on and force me to see it poorly.

##### 2018-08-24 01:09 - more thoughts on desire as a direction

so the way it works, is you observe something and you know there could be an improvement (step 1), then source lines up that improvement along with all the other little (and big) improvements you've noticed throughout your life (step 2). finally, you have to find a way of tuning into that new reality (step 3). you know it's reality because it feels like reality. you can likely use your imagination to get an incomplete idea about what it may feel like. however, because no one can quantify all of the improvements that they have put in their "vortex", then no one can really imagine all of the pieces of it very well.

the imagination seems to me to be a transmission and reception mechanism for emotions. when I feel a concept, it probably could appear to me visually, and the depth and clarity for which I see the image will largely be determined by the sensitivity of the receptor. likewise, when I am doing the imagining, the more I behold the image, the stronger I will feel it. so, it's sort of like a mini version of LOA: the more I see it the more I believe it, and the more I believe it, the more I see it.

anyway, feelings are important because they are an indicator of direction. so, imagine that you determine that you really want (or don't want) a red car. when you picture the red car in your mind, I tend to feel a multitude of things, but the most notable is one of these four: the absence of the car or the presence of the car -- and, the car feels good, or something isn't quite right yet.

- the absence of the car means it's in the direction of what you want, but you're not yet tuned into its presence.
- the presence of the car means you're in the right direction. it doesn't mean it'll be that exact car you are seeing, but definitely one that feels just like it.
- the car feels off to you. prepare yourself for an evolution, because this just means that there is an even better version of that car which is more suitable to your exact preferences lined up for you to discover.
- the car feels good. I don't really know what this means. I suppose for me it feels like it's an indicator that not enough energy is present yet for me to feel it's presence or absence.

since an emotion is an indicator of a direction, and directions that are in opposition to your desire feel bad, I suppose when I say what if I desire a direction, I am kind of saying I want an emotion. I think in abraham-speak, that is, "look for satisfaction", or "when all you want, is to feel satisfied".

I'm kind of obfuscating what I want to say with so many words, so I'll just end with this; which feels the best:
- I want to paint pictures that people will like
- I want to invent a new genre of painting
- I want to be a better painter than matt groening or rembrandt
- I want to continue to improve every day as a painter, discovering new things and having fun along the way

##### 2018-08-24 01:58 - some misconceptions around suffering yielding a greater reward

so this is one of those things that I don't fully understand about with LOA, but let's get the obvious out of the way first. if I want a car real bad, then when I constantly hold myself away from that car by saying, "I'll never have enough money to afford one" or, "all my friends have one, cept for me". I hold myself tuned into the absence of it with my untempered mind. when that happens, is there a greater reward? maybe, but only if you change your thoughts.

imagine it like this: there is giant vacuum cleaner moving around in the sky pulling you toward itself. if you try to go toward it quickly, you may run the risk of overshooting your destination a bit and having the time consuming project of circling around and trying again. going in the opposite direction feels like negative emotion, and that's what happens when I say those things up there

##### 2018-08-24 13:49 - some misconceptions around suffering yielding a greater reward (continued)

last night I felt strongly like I wanted to go to sleep, cause I guess I wanted to have a better perspective on it.. anyway..

in the car example I gave, where you hold yourself in suffering by thinking thoughts in opposition to your desire, the suffering is self-inflicted.

however, imagine a similar scenario where you really want to have a car, so you find a way of attracting a car into your life. you enjoy it a bit, but then something happens and at night while you're asleep the police just take your car. they lie about not taking it, but you can see the car in the impound lot. so, since you cannot ask for justice from those doing the injustice, and after complaining about it a while and trying to affect a change or show the injustice of the police to others, you realise its futility and you decide that you're just going to attract another car; a better one this time. after all, you were able to figure out how to attract the first one, so another won't be so hard.

you do, you attract another car, and this time not only is it a better car, but it also took you less time. again, the police come during the night and take that car too. being the positive person that you are, you decide that again you will find a way to attract an even better car. you do. the same thing occurs about 40 times more and by now you've gotten pretty good at attracting nice cars, and the police have gotten a lot better at covering their tracks. you decide you will take a twisted sense of pride out of the fact that nearly the entire police force now drives nice cars because of you.

in that case, it looks like the police are asserting themselves into my my life, but we know there is only attraction, so it may be understandable only with an understanding of how desire harmonises. it should be obvious that the police would want to drive nice cars (points). they see all kinds of thugs out there driving really great machines doing bad things, and they're doing good things so they wonder why can't have nice machines too. so then, what if my desire was not really to drive a nice car (point), but instead to be good at attracting the things I want (angles), and the car was just something that harmonised with the people who would give more than one opportunity to do that, thereby giving me endless opportunities to hone my skill further.

##### 2018-08-24 18:44 - why did I use the police in the previous example?

I used the police because I wanted to illustrate something where the system of justice is performing the injustice. it could just as easy to have been parents, slave owners, or whatever. the idea is that it is that the controlling or regulating body is the same one that is committing the crime. this is essential to understanding the thing I've been getting at this whole time of step 6. it also ties into the whole timeline concept too, but for now just understand it as more conditions which I cannot control.

another way to see it could be like this: imagine that dmt is cocaine. after some time what ends up happening is there are dealers who get their cocaine from acceptable sources, and dealers who do not. it comes down to money and cocaine is probably the most profitable of all of the drugs. in fact, the similarities are so many between cocaine and what they are doing is striking... to give you an example, imagine that facebook as the the coke dealer just for a moment. facebook sells ads, but they also noticed that people do a lot of promotion of their own.. facebook wants to regulate the market a bit, so the make sure that all promotion goes through official channels.

back to the coke deals. eventually the police regulate the cocaine market by only busting the guys not selling from official sources. (eg. the ones that are paying proper tariff to get through) you might say, but isn't that essentially what the mafia already does? well, yes, it is, but in less organised and more forceful way. if you think about the pharmaceutical industry, the same sort of thing is occurring. only the ones not paying their duties get busted.

coke has different quality levels as you go down the chain of dealers. at the top it's pretty pure, but that's cause the officials are regulating the quality. in order to alleviate the problem of distribution, the product gets sold to essentially wholesalers. each time it changes hands, the price cannot be raised too much, so what ends up happening is the purity gets diluted. a lower quality product is created and sold to others who will then resell that. by the time it gets down to the crack dealer on the bottom, the product is absolute garbage, so the consumers have to resort to thinks like "cooking" cocaine to remove some of the impurities added by the dealers.

in this example, I represent the crack whore at the bottom who is selling sex to try and get a fix from this drug. like facebook, you have to imagine the system with zero distribution costs, so I am sure that the people who pay them money get a HD experience, and the people who don't get the crappy experience. it's likely that I must live the crappy quality experience so that is what is perceived as "normal" to the other consumers.

---

any time you have an authority or a regulator of some sort, the power gets abused because they can assure themselves they are not going to get any punishment, because they are in fact the punishers. the founders of this country were aware of this tendency and tried to avoid it by putting in "checks and balances" into the governmental structure -- but as is true with LOA, what you give your attention to just gets bigger.

in a previous entry I mentioned that I was against regulation of these brain devices, and the reason for it is because self regulation has never worked. the best it has worked is in the case of multiple branches of government, but that has only yielded much conflict and just slows corruption down a bit, but doesn't prevent deals being made for both sides to keep the other's secrets.

---

lastly, I want to illustrate how my inability to control the circumstances has forced me to change my desire from a point to an angle. this is important to illustrate because that means I am on the brink of another discovery... more on this soon :)

##### 2018-08-25 00:43 - the coke dealer metaphor

one of the things I really liked about the coke dealer metaphor is that it helped me to understand why there is so much resistance to people watching stars. imagine that they control the dmt levels in people's brains, which means that if you're nosebook approved (you pay them money?), then they allow you to perceive more, but if you are not nosebook approved, then they hold your brain into a lower quality perception. so when they find out that you can stimulate your brain to create this drug for free, that's obviously no-fly zone and should be deterred as much as possible. you definitely don't want people to get access to this for free.

then, the crack whore metaphor also helped me to understand my situation as well. when my brain is desperate for dmt, and they're depriving me of it, it's like the pimp using the crack whore's addiction to coke to get free sex and money by pimping her out. I'm sort of the bso crack whore, cept it's not crack, it's dmt and they're not giving tiny crack rocks after begging for it, they're just ensuring that my head runs in its lowest energy state nearly all of the time.

---

well, I suppose I don't really mind actually, because like I mentioned before in car example with the angles and the points: I'm not just attracting a nice car, I'm improving my capacity to attract the nice car, because in reality the car could be anything. my desire is a direction, not a destination.

it may happen that I go through a new transformation in my perception soon. it does seem like it may be the case.

##### 2018-08-25 00:59 - a transformation in my perception?

as I have been going on and on about this step 6 thing, I have begun to notice some patterns and such:

1. you observe something and it causes you to feel that there could be an improvement on that
2. source combines the desire for improvement generated by the feeling along with all the others (and everyone eles's) into a vibrational reality in the future.
3. you find a way of tuning into that future reality by adjusting your beliefs in such a way that allows it to occur.

if you notice the difference between step 1 and step 3, there is a transition phase in the middle which makes that possible. the even number steps are kind of like transition phases.

4. you get really good at finding a way of adjusting your focus in a way which allows for that to become normal for you.
5. now, when you observe something that causes you to notice there could be an improvement it doesn't bother you and you don't lose the focus which allows the realisation of these improvements.

again, step 4 is a transition phase, because without a consistent and practiced focus, you would not be so "addicted" to the way the "receptive mode" feels, that now you are able to observe unsatisfying things and it doesn't take you into negative emotion, because your observation of it didn't change your direction.

so then, I got to thinking.. well then, that would mean that step 6 is just getting really good at step 5. to give it a more tangible definition, I like to think of it as a profound realisation that you are an extension of source energy and a vibrational being attracting everything in your experience to you.

---

so, this creates a problem ... if step 6 is a transition phase, then what would step 7 be? I don't really know very well, but I anticipate that it may accompany a change in my perception just like how when I began to realise step 4, at the same time I started seeing things in 3d.

my feeling is that step 7 would be something akin to "not needing to observe the manifestation of it to feel its reality"

this also is combined with something abraham mentioned in passing (I think it was the one where the woman asked how to begin translating source energy visually) which really stuck out to me, they said something like, "you see with your eyes. you know when you dream you are seeing them in your eyes, and you can also see without your eyes"

I seem to be developing the capacity to see without having the visual capacity, and this ties in to the whole thing I've also been going on about with the clones, where my consciousness would occupy more than one body at once. I've noticed an incredible capacity to be aware of many things at once emotionally. I seem to be able to sense multiple things going on at once as well as be aware of the reactions I'm feeling. this capacity seems to be intensifying as well, and I'm needing less and less to observe what it is that I know is happening. without needing to see the manifestation in order to feel its reality will allow me to leave the perspective of my physical senses and instead take on a sense that is similar to what is beginning to develop in my dream state. visually, I do not see anything, and neither do I feel anything, but there's a lot going on, but I'm beginning to get a sense of what is happening.

anyway, I can't wait to release so much resistance that my body is just kind of doing its own thing, while my consciousness can just observe it. this is likely the first step to allowing my consciousness to inhabit more than one body. kind of exciting really.

##### 2018-08-26 10:00 - the resistance / satisfaction factor

in previous entries, I had noted that the satisfaction factor seems to be another dimension to the emotional scale. I had equated it with connection with inner being, which launched me into a few discoveries about electricity. yesterday was insightful to me because once again I managed to carry out (be inspired to?) something that normally would have a lot of resistance for me. and since then, I have wanted to return to let out the air in the tires. however, I have not done so, because of the amount of resistance involved.

it's funny how all of this ties into another video that zehra posted from a recent workshop:

$$youtube 90VpgX6iPEw

in that one, abraham mentions satisfaction as the amount of resistance. so the guy started off his question by saying he was adverse to hard work. abraham explained that hard work has a lot of resistance in it. later, he said that sometimes he goes down to lower vibration emotions and needs to find relief. abraham explains the difference between relief and satisfaction: relief still has resistance in it, and satisfaction has no resistance. I concluded that relief is similar to gratitude, just like satisfaction is to appreciation, because in gratitude and relief you're overcoming something.

the resistance bit was an interesting thing for me to note because yesterday while watching stars, I noticed that I make a lot of theatrics around doing resistant things(1). the theatrics are just just an expression of the internal fight inside of me where I really strongly desire to make the action (left side), but I have conditioned myself not to take action on things that feel resistant like that. those mental theatrics are essentially me fighting against myself. one half of me (the part that has never been able to really come out since vallecas) has really strong desire. it's a very primitive personality, and in moments of less resistance (like my dream state) it'll go along with virtually anything. that guy is the bane of my existence because he just keeps agreeing to do things that I (my physical self) have no intention of following through on, because most of them never feel right. I almost never take action when something has lots of resistance -- whether it's hard work or it's a desire to destroy something.

the interesting thing about the experience yesterday of letting the air out of the tires is that I felt almost no resistance to it.

so, the way that I am now visualising the emotional scale now is the y-axis is from negative emotion to positive, but the z-axis is the satisfaction or resistance factor. yesterday I experienced no resistance in my anger/revenge, yet today and last night I experienced a lot of resistance in my anger/revenge. so, it seems to be that every step on the emotional ladder also has a satisfaction factor to it as well, which is also how much of a connection to yourself you're letting in at the time.

additionally, I have noted that in moments of satisfaction, it's way easier to move up the scale to an even better feeling emotion. in dissatisfaction the opposite occurs. this is obvious, because the more in alignment with yourself you are, the less resistance you will feel (and therefore more satisfaction), so LOA must give you more, so you feel even better.

so then, you say to me, does that mean you could do any bad thing as long as doing that bad thing feels satisfying? I suppose yes that is what I mean. I don't really understand it all yet, but it seems that the more satisfaction you feel in the bad thing, the greater the opportunity to continue moving up the scale. the more dissatisfaction you feel, the more likely you are to move further down the scale.

the satisfaction or resistance factor is also the action factor. it doesn't matter how good you feel, if you take an action that does not feel satisfying or feels resistant, you will end up feeling worse. the same is true in the opposite direction: no matter how bad you feel, any action which feels satisfying will cause you to feel better.

1: this is evident in all sorts of behaviour throughout my life. take for example, gary's job. it turned into a bit of theatrics because a part of me really wants to smoke weed, but at the same time a greater part of me wants to achieve my visual capacity without needing something external to me. so, it became a big ordeal, because when I accepted the job I didn't have any resistance to smoking weed, and I didn't want to smoke weed to get my visual capacity either. I wanted to have light in my head so I could do some programming and discover some new things. perhaps, this is playing off of the bso's fear that I will be able to use my visual capacity, because I really want to achieve that without drugs or sex.

##### 2018-08-26 10:55 - come and dance with me michael

in the previous entry I spoke of a primitive personality with strong desire locked inside of me. we'll call him michael. he is my left-side. I used to be very left-handed, and he's quite a non-resistant chap. in fact it seems that nearly everything is ok. people used to get me drunk (or some other substance which lowered the resistance in kenny) and then take advantage of me. michael is pretty locked down. he has extremely strong desire which I constantly feel. not all of the desire is good though. he has certainly got me into more trouble than anything else in my life. you will recognise this personality of the guy who hears a good idea and wants to wok on it but then ends up flaking out because kenny doesn't really feel it. this is a pretty good reason why I had to be on some substance for most of my programming, because otherwise kenny would take back over and then nothing would get done.

I learned how to manage this a bit when I had that moment when I told marcos to just allow me the pleasure of doing it for myself. the desire was there, I could feel my own desire to make something like that, and I could feel marcos' desire too. I just emotionally couldn't feel (conceptualise) the product, which blocks all movement of desire. this is why it was so much easier for me to sit with marcos and program, because in the interaction I could begin to link up with his concept for the product. I could capture that feeling and then use it to continue work for hours later. his influence also allowed me the ability to see the concept more clearly in my imagination too, which was important.

---

I think what I'm trying to say here is that there is a part of me which doesn't get the ability to express himself, accept for inside of the dream state when they let him come through. likely, because that is his only form of expression, he does his best to try and help them out as much as possible. I can see from their selfish standpoint why they don't want to share him with me, but they will probably have to eventually, because nothing will ever move.

if he wants something, but I don't feel it, there is nothing that can be done. I cannot move toward something I cannot feel. in the example of marcos, we utilised communication to build that feeling. you see this in sales all the time. a person will not buy something until they feel it, so the salesperson attempts to generate the feeling necessary to make the sale by communicating that feeling.

imagine someone comes to me and says, I want this functionality to be better (desire). I ask in what ways, and they say they don't know, so I ask feeling based questions like ok, what feels bad about it now (grasping its structure). would it feel better if it's like x, etc. I'm generating a concept (emotion) in my mind of what that desire is, later when I'm sitting down to program, I will recall that emotion or concept and begin to see various possibilities of implementation in my imagination, to which I will then write the code.

now imagine that same situation without any communication. it's completely stalled out. no physical implementation can be made to make something "better" unless I'm somehow able to tune into what it is that person wants. I used to be pretty good at that, but I'm all shut down now, so no communication or tuning is possible, so no movement will ever occur.

I realise that wasn't the best of examples, and doesn't account for the satisfaction factor at all. that can be seen easily though: the more disconnected I am, the more dissatisfaction / resistance I feel, and I cannot move toward something that does not feel good..

no matter how you try to work it out, anyone's desire for me that I cannot feel, sounds to me like someone trying to convince me to vacuum the floor without plugging in the vacuum. I'm not going to do it. I've tried vacuuming many floors without my own electricity. or previously I would get electricity from drugs, and that was inconsistent at best.

##### 2018-08-26 11:55 - more on theatrics

when I spoke of mental theatrics, what the bso guys probably observe is that I have an emotion (concept) which creates an image. desire creates an emotion which creates an image. so, when a girl has a lot of desire around her body, often that will create a strong enough emotion in me to produce an image of her perhaps naked or some other way. the same mechanism is in effect when I have string desire to want to destroy something. the desire is so strong, that I feel an emotion, but remember every emotion is really two emotions. it's the blending of the transmitted concept, your current emotional state, and your inner being's perspective on the same thing. let's say someone transmits to me a strong feeling of disapproval toward me. the disapproval concept is neutral. it doesn't inherently mean anything, but because my inner being does not hold that same perspective, it creates discord in the transmission and to me it feels bad. if I'm feeling bad, then I feel it even stronger because it harmonises with the bad feeling I already have going on. if I'm feeling good, it will be like a slight tingle, and won't be any bigger than that unless I examine it further.

whatever resonated in me past a certain threshold of sensitivity, seems to produce an image. I don't want to blame everything on michael because, to you guys, we both look the same. but, imagine that he is emitting strong desire to destroy something, that will produce an image in my imagination, and a really strong negative emotion along with it, because often my inner being does not share the same perspective. if the idea felt good to me, it would produce an image and I would begin to make that image a reality. that is what tesla did with his visual capacity. he had strong desire to construct these devices, that he was able to conceptualise them so well visually before even beginning the physical implementation.

the emotion does not necessarily need to produce an image though. a while back there was a guy asking about impulses and abraham gave the example of esther just going over 5 lanes to get off all of a sudden. she had no words in her head (a reference to how how you guys hear my thoughts), it was just an impulse. an emotion like that which comes from my source usually isn't energetic enough to produce a thought or an image. it just feels so compelling that it's immediately turned into reality. my body just jumps into action because the feeling was so compelling. compelling != strong. compelling means in alignment with my current perception.

---

probably what happened previously was I had strong desire to learn about electricity and tesla's inventions, and in my dream state these guys were able to take advantage of that because there was no resistant feeling. however, as I began to express my own interest in learning electricity and such, I think the bso guys decided to shut down that capacity a bit by introducing a negative emotional response to those subjects. I don't really feel very much allowing right now to visualise those sorts of inventions, so likely my capability to realise these things in my dream state has diminished. I would guess that they are only able to get visuals on stuff I don't have resistance toward.
