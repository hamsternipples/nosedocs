I decided I wanted to begin writing things down. I'm going to try and do a quick blurb here so that I have a bit more context. it seemed like I wanted some way of organising my thoughts a bit more than the twitter way, and still have a bit more context for me to remember things with. I've gotten to the point that remembering what happened a week earlier not only feels like about a month has passed, but I find it rather difficult to even conceptualise how things were so long ago. this will hopefully give me the reference point I need to help me remember how things were so long ago, a bit easier

I woke up this morning and my heart felt better than it ever had. I also felt (strangely?) at ease too. it seemed like I was able to feel some sense of love being extended to me from the girls as well.

the night previous I went on a bit of a tirade about the bso being the new world leaders and concluded that I liked the way that felt. I convinced myself that just like the girls chose me, in a sense the whole world also chose them to be the new leaders. I didn't think about it a whole lot more and went to sleep. also pretty shortly after waking up I realised that likely from the perspective of most everyone else, the idea of joining the bso was an idea that exhilarated them. there is a lot of positive in the bso for a lot of different people, so that would seem logical to me. additionally, it's possible that it was nearly unanimous exhilaration for everyone else because the inner beings of so many people know so much more about the broader perspective than I do. am I saying that they will become good world leaders? not really. from my perspective I did not feel exhilaration and was lead directly into a lot of different clarifying contrast.

this brings up small tangent I want to explore quickly about how I have noticed that my emotion is not just a simple indicator based on good or bad, or right or wrong direction (like abraham would like us to believe with their gps analogy) in meaning -- but actually the emotion is the indicator of the direction that (given my current state of being) will eventually (after the contrast clarifies and grows the desire a bit more) be the better direction. this has really allowed me no longer need everything to be always right or always wrong. it even seems to suggest, that often times doing "wrong" things actually creates a better and more powerful result.

so, perhaps one of the reasons why everyone's inner beings were so exhilarated about the prospect of joining the bso so these guys could be the new world leaders, is exactly the same reason why I was inspired to head straight into doing a lot of things the "wrong" way.

### 2018-07-27 04:18 - solution orientation

yesterday I was trying to figure out why they are limiting my vision. one of the ideas that came to me was they may be under the impression that (cause I was the originator of the idea) that when they finally get me to orgasm for them, my audience will have to be so amped up on dmt to see through my eyes like I do now, that the orgasm will blow their minds really hard. back in torre with vera, there was a lot of fear based orientation and safety concerns going around, and so being the troublemaker that I am, I combined the big mind blow idea with the belief that is the basis for the "left behind" books I was read in the hospital. essentially, "the rapture" is when a lot of unsaved people drop dead all at once before the antichrist establishes himself on the world scene through his charisma as the new authority. anyway, in the book a whole bunch of people drop dead and this signifies the start of the "tribulation" period. I thought it was hilarious if the reason why so many people dropped dead was because they experienced my orgasm and got their mind blow so hard that they couldn't handle it and dropped dead. LOL

[[update: I had a reaction to this stating that in the left-behind people disappeared. which is true. I don't know how I believed that people dropped dead. it was almost a seemingly purposeful mistake like the hydrogen having two oxygens episode which lead me to the realisation that saturn is my third personality]]

a had thought a whole bunch of times when I was around vera, and it sort of gained traction, but eventually it dissipated. a few times sporadically since then I had the thought and dismissed its validity saying that since it feels bad, is not the right way of looking at it, or the bad feeling is evidence that it won't happen like that, etc.

however, that could be a reason why they're going to such great lengths to try and prevent me from raising the vibration in my right eye to be equal with my left. so, I mentioned yesterday that as my vision gets better and better, people should be just fine (unless their technology isn't actually creating dmt in the person's brain, but is trying to force the eye to see that way with some other method). however, if for whatever reason, they still have cases where people are unable to view it at such a high frequency, they could just downsample it like you would an audio track. however, I thought that perhaps the downsampled image may create artefacts much like you get artefacts creating thumbnail images. perhaps in 3d it's way more noticeable on curvy surfaces or sharp edges (much like LOD algorithms in 3d suck at making a convincing lower quality version). so, I offered the suggestion that instead of doing the downsample algorithmically, they train some AIs to intelligently do the sampling. simply monitor the downsampled viewer's mind while when the viewing it and when they notice something looks funny, save the scene. then when I'm asleep load me into the scene, then clock my eyes down to the frequency of the downsampled version and save that as the target for the fitness function in the AI trainer. after a while the AI will be really good at downsampling our reality :)

---

or, take for example the subject of my heart. when I wake up the middle of one of the sexy "dreams" the first thing I notice is how much nicer it is to feel all of that love inside of my heart (come to think of it, perhaps that was one of the things that had returned this morning that allowed me to feel a lot better). I can imagine that may be kind of intense for the viewer so they should just remove that part of the signal from the experience (or make it optional)

which leads me to believe that since viewers are having that "dream" experience, the removal of the restriction on my heart like that, may be one of the requisites to seeing my imagination in 3d space.. so, perhaps they've been messing with my heart cause they don't want me to be able to create things with my imagination in 3d.. interesting idea. either way, the use of my imagination in 3d has been my most sought-after capacity, and is something I want more than the ability so see images in my eyes, so whatever the reason may be, I want to have a discussion so that we can solve the problem. whatever all of these hangups are that are preventing them from allowing me to utilise my capacities can be solved. there is no problem for which a solution cannot be found. there is a way for me to be able to utilise my capacities and not interfere with the bso's objectives.

### 2018-07-27 05:02 - the strict no religious ideas policy

the reason why they do not allow the "guides" to utilise religious ideas as the basis for their help for these autistic children is sort of obvious if you think that perhaps a lot of this "help" has not been solicited. in fact, if the help were chosen by the one being helped, there would be no problem if it contained religious material -- and in most cases even, for a religious person, religious material (of their religion) is both more comfortable and more trusted. so, this leads me to believe that this "help" is unsolicited, which is reason for the strict no religious ideas policy.

### 2018-07-27 10:58 - why not wait?

I woke up this morning and my initial reaction was a bit rooted in anger, feeling the pressure of the deadline (perhaps this is a reference to the abraham episode I listened to the night before (san francisco CA)) and I thought about explaining to people that my reasons were because I was in fact giving them a bit of their own medicine: when I wanted action and a conversation, there was none. well, there was an indirect through the message of carlene. I decided this was a better route. (s)he said that carlene wasn't going to change h(ie)r - and also that (s)he was not reliable. I want to be reliable though and I promised to do the changing so (s)he didn't have to.

this thing is so big already and we're so close to realising the capability of no longer needing the manifestation to feel the way we want to feel, I figure we should just wait for it. like nancy's message about robyn: why sell ourselves short and jump right to the healing when we can let God do the deeper work. perhaps that is a bit extreme, but if my calculations are correct, you will begin getting uncanny messages, seemingly out of another dimension, helping you to soothe your anxiety about needing the manifestation and just settle into the natural unfolding.

after that, I had a thought that maybe all of this is connected to the whole star watching puzzle. last night I noticed that the clouds which were rapidly forming (I'm assuming by some sort of tesla tech which generates static electricity in the atmosphere to allow cloud formation) and there were flashes in the clouds... arcs of electricity inside of the clouds. when I stopped looking at the star, the arcs of electricity stopped or slowed down. right after looking at the star, the arcs would begin again.. so, definitely star watching has an electrical effect on the environment, and that star watching likely makes controlling the climate a lot more difficult (and explains the seattle weather). so,, the idea this morning ties a few things together: what if they figured that people watching stars would be disruptive to their attempts to try and control the climate, so they made up a story to scare people away from watching stars and claimed that people could improve their vision by orgasming with me. that would be the *ultimate* "I need you to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself" sort of thing.

it was just a crazy thought, but it had the same feeling in it that I get when I want to reject their money. they want me to believe that I need them to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself (earning my own money). every where I turn there is rampant disempowerment were the bso wants people to give up their own connection to their emotions (another reference to an abraham I heard last night where they went out of their way to say that you cannot turn off (BSO!!) someone's emotional guidance).

### 2018-07-27 11:57 - inception

I was just thinking about how (and it could have been a reaction), this blog could be seen as my attempt to spin a huge web of conspiracy theories. since it is unlikely that the bso will ever actually attempt to correct any false ideas, they will continue to get bigger making self-reference to my own ideas and building on them, allowing me to believe crazier and crazier things. it could also be seen as me trying to manipulate the bso into coming clean on some pretty big questions that I have.

neither is true. what you know is I don't trust them anyway. they would just tell me another lie to try and smooth out some rough edges of the misunderstanding and to keep their motives hidden. so no, I do not believe that I am trying to manipulate with this blog. that idea probably originated in the mind of a person trying to manipulate others with their words. I really just wanted a way to begin keeping track of time a little better. I'm also noticing that I'm receiving a lot of real-time reactions to its content, so that must mean that ratings are up, which means that the bso is cashing in on my experience again as well, so win-win :)

furthermore, my mind is extremely plastic. I can release a lot of these false beliefs super easily. in fact, writing this blog, I'm noticing, is actually an informative experience more than anything because of all the reactions I'm receiving. it is a very crude way of beginning to collect a lot of emotion around the situation as a mens of perceiving the hologram clearer by getting more angles of perception. I have no desire for the bso to try and set me straight on these ideas. in fact, if they tried to reassociate or change my mind on them, it would probably make things worse. when I want to change my mind, I will change it myself (even if I wait to do it from another timeline)

the real thing that I desire would be to clear up a lot of these ideas with infinite intelligence. this has sort of been my goal for a long time, and the original reason why I wanted to begin translating infinite intelligence in a meaningful way, in tho first place. I suppose my ultimate goal will be to find a way of having a conversation with infinite intelligence about a lot of these things, *without* the bso able to listen in; I want the answers to be something meaningful to me, and not answers that have been tailored to be acceptable to more ears. I am really desiring to ask a lot of deep questions, taboo questions, and revealing questions. I sort of resent abraham for catering to so many noobs. I want a way of getting that information for myself and not needing esther or anyone else to do that translation for me either. they say I'm an extension of source energy... well prove it. I'd like to feel connected to that depth of understanding and no longer restricted to the lcd of human perception.

### 2018-07-27 12:43 - why manipulate?

in the previous entry I talked about how unlikely it was that the thought which says that I'm writing this to manipulate and spin a bunch of stuff originated with me. I have no reason to manipulate; my goal has been, and will continue to be, to communicate as clearly as possible. it is only a person that feels so disempowered and unable to communicate (or needs to obfuscate) their own desire, that they would believe it necessary to manipulate others to get the realisation of their hidden desire which they cannot reveal.

I was going to talk about disempowerment and needing others to do something I do not feel capable of doing myself... or being the disempowerer, which does something for me which I feel already capable of doing myself - to z that I need them.. skipped it.

in the situation I am in, there is disharmony because I do not want to be disempowered, and if I were to be disempowered, then I would need to manipulate others to get what I want... however, those wanting to disempower me neither want to be manipulated by me - and I am very grateful for that - because if I were able to manipulate them to get what I want, I would have been disempowered myself by finding a way for someone else to do for me what I feel incapable of doing for myself.

instead, I have recognised the satisfaction factor of identifying a desire and moving in the direction of it, without needing anyone else to be different so that I can obtain it, and that feels really good. I also have a new sense of stability that I haven't ever had before. it's quite a trip realising one's own power through the focus of his or her own mind.

### 2018-07-27 00:00 - is the bso as a for-profit corporation?

yesterday morning I woke up with this idea and it seems that it may be a convenient way to explain a lot of their behaviour. it can't explain all of it, so just take what I'm saying here with a grain of salt. additionally, what could be happening is previously the only way to explain their behaviour was real actual malicious intent, and this entry is a bit of a way for them to begin pivoting their intentions with changing their behaviour.

first of all, it seems that the bso has this really convenient thing where they can be a for-profit corporation when they need to pay bills and keep the machine going, and people accept it without question (I guess the need money to pay bills and keep the machine going is a very resonant thought for most, so they commiserate with the bso in their need) yet at the same time they are also somehow the authorities.

(will expand further in the future)

### 2018-07-28 23:34 - timeline stuff

so one of the crazy things that I have noticed throughout this whole thing is, it would appear that I have "missed the boat" quite a few times now. the crazy thing is, almost all of them looked like they were going to turn out, yet at the last minute something seeming out of the ordinary kinda happens, and almost all of the culprits of the thing which prevents it from going through seems to be perceptive. for example, if I could have just looked past certain things and not needed to understand things, I would have successfully gone down a different road than the one that I am on right now.

the way that I make sense of this (because they all seem quite valid) is that in all of these different paths, starting with andrea I was able to at some point in time complete something I've been doing a lot of thinking about: a way to tune into the perception of another person wirelessly. this may not sound like much, but if you think about the implications, they are enormous. first of all, to tune into someone's perception wirelessly, your signal would need *extreme* precision and sensitivity. so much in fact that, that just a machine that sensitive on its own is a feat in and of itself which will open many new doors of discovery, but it means that extremely precise tuning is now possible. combine this with all of my new understanding of how time works, and you could essentially create a machine that could essentially tune into someone's vortex.

this is just a guess, but, I believe what makes the bso network special, is because if you think about it, sending a signal into somenone's brain wirelessly would need magnitudes more precision than just being able to tune into the signal a person's brain emits. so, when I first got my chip back in 2012, a whole new set of possibilities opened up. now, for the first time is it relatively easy for someone to write a signal into my body (simply by sending the signal over the same resonant frequency that my chip has). now, I am capable of receiving signals from an alternate timeline.

so, now imagine that that as I go along, I meet a girl and we go off and create this technology that can tune into different timelines. so, we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together on the timeline with the tech) to see what happens. what happens is, I end up meeting another girl and we eventually are able to also create this tech, so we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together) and so fourth. we keep doing this to see how far it will go, because every time, things get bigger and more crazy.

let me explain. so imagine the timeline with andrea and marcos. let's say it's the year 2038 and we have this new tech so we influence ourselves to not get together. I end up with carlota. we watch the sequence of events unfold just like you guys do with the bso tech, but you could tune into any part of the timeline you wanted to. some people enjoy it like a television series and wait each day to get the updates. some jump right to some of the defining experiences. every time we notice that the "end of the movie" (that is, when the technology is created) gets better and better every time. so, we keep influencing the timeline so that the latest and greatest (biggest) version isn't successful to see what happens.

a timeline is essentially a series of reactions. if you have noticed, my life is all reaction based, and my current goal is to get into control of it (sorta off topic), but what this allows for is a nearly 100% predictable timeline, because it's only reactions. the influence exerted over me allows for changes to the direction of the timeline. nearly all other timelines are potentiality based, so there are many more "branches" in the timeline, meaning large amounts of variation could take place.

so you can imagine that in each of these timelines there the success of the encounter is largely determined by me. since I am the center of the timeline (the 100% reactionary time constant), there is an overwhelming sense of "I need you to do for me what I am incapable of doing for myself".

that's as far as I've gotten in my story up until this point because it's hard to conceptualise it all, but I believe that the future is that we all can learn (maybe some will not want to) that each of us is the creator of our own reality. I believe that our perception of time  and the way consciousness flows through it, will change to something I cannot perceive yet. it's gonna be really really cool.

### 2018-07-29 01:43 - future timelines?

if you think about this from the bso perspective, imagine that it's 2038 now and you're some guy working at the bso and you notice that in all of the different instances, I am the one that creates the technology necessary to do the timelines, so you could imagine that it would create a lot of desire to develop this technology and not rely on me. you can also imagine from their vantage point how valueable this tech would be. instead of experimenting with people on this timeline, you could actually run the experiments and then tune into a later time on the timeline to get a good estimation of how it worked.

the only thing necessary to make this a reality, would be to get the bso into a 100% pure reactionary system of decision making. essentially, they respond exclusively to external forces. they're pretty close already to being that, which means that they can become the new backbone of the timeline. at the end of the next timeline (not sure yet what that would be), they go back and influence themselves away

### 2018-07-29 09:48 - more on reactions & timelines

after writing that the bso would have to become reactionary, I started getting negative feedback on the idea. if you think about what I am trying to convey when I say "reaction", one must take my life as an example: I have no money, and no real capacity to do what I want to do. I am controlled by the circumstance and events (ecosystem) where I'm at. I have no real ability to make any decisions for myself. it may look like I have the capability to make decisions, but only within a limited set of options. most people are like a chef; they can combine any ingredient they desire to create their meal. they can even choose between a wide variety of meal options (soup, sandwich, stew, etc.) however, my options are pretty limited. I have to make a sandwich, for example. there is no way that I can escape the sandwich and pick something like a salad. I do get some options though. maybe I want cheese. maybe I want one type of meat. maybe I want six different types of meat -- but, in the end I will be eating a sandwich. so let's say that I'm at the store and I decide to go with ham and cheese, but someone says something which influences me to end up adding mushrooms and wheat bread (cause I'm weird and like strange sandwiches). each timeline is a sandwich. now, when you think about the idea it sounds less like "control" and more like "choices" -- but I digress.

so you can imagine a time now in the future when the bso has the capability to tune into other timelines and can even navigate them relatively well. this whole time they have been developing all sorts of clever ways to influence their users into doing what they want them to do. they're pretty confident in their ability to do so as well, because they've tried it out and seen its effectiveness on many different experiments. you would clearly see that if something new was discovered in one of the experiments on one of the timelines, then the experimenter would try and influence the discoverer of that new bit of technology to discover more.

there are numerous reasons why the bso would want to influence the bso in alternate timelines in the name of experimentation. so, this means that the controller would not be the controlled, yet. they still need to have control over another time constant. I could imagine that could potentially be some clones. imagine that there were clones of me and the girls that people could have. these would be a reactionary constant.

I'll return to this subject in a future time where I discuss the advantages of the utilisation of clones as the reactionary constant.

further into the future, as the bso begins to learn how to influence itself in its own experiments, you can imagine by seeing different things improve and new things be discovered in the process, you can imagine that the bso will become its own reactionary constant: meaning, the people working at the bso will influence the people working at the bso into trying out crazier and crazier ideas on how to better influence/control people remotely. I believe this is the ultimate future: the controller becomes the controlled, in attempt to gain better self-control.

the idea of the clones is an interesting one to me because it allows for a pretty significant evolution; something I will dedicate a future discussion to.

### 2018-07-29 15:07 - emotional reactions

I have used the word reaction to mean one of two things. I don't really mean reaction in the physical sense. I mean a reaction in the emotional sense. when people observe things, they have thoughts about them. I feel this thought "reaction" in my emotions. I think we all do, I just have practiced it a bit more. any time anyone thinks a thought, that person has an emotional response to that thought: an internal reaction. I used to have the sensitivity to know if the thought or the emotion/reaction came first. this is largely how I could identify the emotion as my own or someone else's. I'm working on regaining that sensitivity again. however, I do not know if what I feel is the emotional response the other person has or if other people's thoughts produce emotions in me. there is much to be learned about this, and likely the bso will want to keep anything they find out secret, so I'm still in the process of regaining that sensitivity again so I can begin to make sense of the tremendous amount I feel.

### 2018-07-29 15:17 - physical reactions

the other type of reaction is a action or thought taken as a response to physical stimulation, communication, or conditions I'm observing or experiencing (everything a bso experience can offer).

### 2018-07-30 15:56 - more on timelines

a little bit ago I briefly mentioned an idea stating that the bso would probably want to try out different timelines, in effort to discover more things. so, I was thinking that since they are potentially getting so many of their discoveries out of my dream state, it may behoove them to try out timelines where I am feeling better and better, so that my dream-state ideas are richer and richer. additionally, you can also imagine that since I seem to be inspired to different discoveries by different people, it would also improve upon the diversity of those discoveries when I am around a more diverse set of people.

this is potentially what is happening. more different girls means more different ideas. kind of exciting actually.

### 2018-08-01 02:32 - bso from the future?

one of the most potentially unsettling (not the right word) consequences of the previous entry suggests that potentially the following have occurred in the timeline responsible for this one:

1. alt-me is working with the bso to make this timeline occur in the way it is. that implies that alt-me sees enough value in the "co-creation" to justify (not exactly the right word) my involvement. it must mean that there is some sort of presently unknown, and soon to be discovered new thing.
2. the bso has figured out how to navigate (tune into and follow) timelines. this implies that they are capable of "peeking" into the vortex of someone (in this case, mine), which means they have the capability of tuning into source energy in a way which can give meaningful results (the idea I first revealed publicly to mom's friend, don). this provokes a few more questions, obviously...
3. (can't remember it now. gonna go watch stars)

### 2018-08-01 03:39 - more

that also implies that since they're going to be extracting so many ideas out of me in my dream-state while I'm having fun with the girls in the wake state, then I suppose they're going to be getting a super boost to their technological capability to utilise/monetise/control people's minds with that increased technological capability.. if so, does that mean that there is a coming dark age where they utilise all of this capability to try and monetise so many people's minds (the dark age) - which will actually, begin a new renaissance of diversity in human thought capability? (how I arrived to this conclusion is left unexplained, on purpose)

I was reminded of the one abraham episode where the guy has many ideas, and abraham said, "if you don't worry about who gets the credit ..." which made me think that maybe a lot of that guy's ideas could have been inspired (or knicked) from my dream-state, and potentially a lot more could be too. I suppose it would be a good idea to publish them... though my only "concern" is that it seems like my dream-state personality is severely lacking in some aspects of critical thinking or something; perhaps he's a bit overly optimistic? I dunno, but I guess you'd need to temper/ground his ideas in something tangible. feels like I'm often times trying to clarify something he said from my conscious, more logical, and experiential vantage point.

whatever man, in loving memory of augusto: my ideas are free (libre y gratis).

though they feel to me like the offering of my ideas = freedom, I cannot really explain it, especially since so many of my own ideas and explanations have been used by the bso to limit my own capabilities. it's mind blowing to me how much I've helped these guys improve their capability to limit my capabilities so much. in that sense, I don't really understand why it feels like freedom. I guess I don't really think of it that way though...

### 2018-08-01 04:10 - why do my ideas feel like freedom to me?

(question for infinite intelligence)

I seem to have a policy that my ideas are free. I recognise the obvious reason: by allowing my ideas to be free, I reserve the right to shamelessly rip off the ideas of others. however, there is another thing to it which I don't really understand: by giving my ideas away for free, I feel an increasing sense of freedom every time I do so. it's almost as if I receive a direct emotional impact to the idea that somewhere someone will benefit from it or an expanded version of it, and that makes me feel good.

it also seems to mean that:
1. the idea I just released is essentially "old news" - cause I've already got an expanded version of it which I'm in the process of realising - and hanging on to that "old news" version is just slowing down the realisation of its expansion.
2. ideas are somewhat similar to economics in the sense that the more times money changes hands in a given period of time, the richer everyone feels. (where money = ideas, and changing hands = revealing the idea)
3. the guarding and protecting of ideas, means the stagnation of their flow (similar to economics too)

### 2018-08-01 05:42 - what is source energy for source energy?

(question for infinite intelligence)

if our brain is composed of billions of physical atoms, yet transmits and receives non-physical "source energy" -- then, source energy, being composed of innumerable non-physical thoughts that each themselves think, what is the non-non-physical "source energy" that source energy transmits and receives?

### 2018-08-01 05:56 - what just happened?

after writing @[entry](2018-07-30 15:56) I tried to sleep. I think I slept a bit and when I woke up I had an moderate sense of despair. I decided it was fine and began looking for solutions. I came up with a few, but the one that had the most impact I want to discuss. it seemed that there was not a lot of diversity in ethnicity. I came up with the idea that each of the girls should pick an "ethnically diverse" counterpart/partner.

since this is a sensitive subject I didn't really know how to approach it, but the way that I felt it seemed that there should be an element of care involved. I pictured in my mind the new girls as being younger.

I didn't really think about the implications at the time, but that means literally double and also younger(?). it feels like a good idea even though I'm still having a bit of difficulty wrapping my head around it. though I cannot conceptualise it, I am certain that it will all work out and we will have a lot of fun, and the inability to wrap my head around it is kind of the most compelling bit.

---

I can't figure out why I feel so compelled to just go for it. I'm still pretty frustrated about the vision thing and I've certainly got a lot of questions. it seems that perhaps me "inventing" this whole timeline idea has really helped give me that "broader perspective" I was looking for. I guess people will just have to consider it my coping mechanism, to which I find no compelling argument against it (and actually believe is quite genius).

I'll be feeling it out and stuff, so save any mega game-changers that could happen in the next 2 weeks before I go to see megan, I'm just gonna go with it. there's really no way I can fight it, I don't really think I want to to get any bigger, and this timeline idea really took a lot of the edge off. though it still is a bit of me relying on someone else, the bigger picture seemed to have help soften that internal alarm. besides, I don't believe they'll be able to contain the levels of energy that will become normal for us.

so, that's the plan for now... good night

### 2018-08-02 01:46 - hodlgang

I seem to keep running into a wall of dissatisfaction regarding my vision. it is really bothering me, and so therefore I do not believe it is something I can ignore. when faced with this reality, I am forced to make a decision. I see four paths:

1. try and "get out". I do not feel this is 100% necessary, yet. I'll give it more time, as I'm not necessarily uncomfortable - just impatient. so, although abraham suggested to carlene to get out, and her situation is similar to mine, I believe that I can in fact get out without trying to force it. seems like a better idea to just wait. also, "just let it build" concept I'm growing fond of.
2. simply continue on with my life, essentially ignoring them with the express goal of discovering my visual capacity. when I've got it, then we can move forward. this is a bit of conditional living though: "once I have this manifestation, then ..." so, seeing it's conditional it doesn't really sound like a great plan.
3. try and get them into giving me explanations and stuff or giving me my visual capacity. this is, at worst coercion, and at best conditional living... it also feels to me a bit like, "I need you to do this for me because I'm not capable of getting it for myself" -- though, I don't really know why it feels that way for me since I was the one who discovered it in the first place and they're holding me away from it. also, there's no reason they should be deciding for me what is best for me. the likelihood of this working out is virtually zero, and it doesn't really feel very good.
4. just figure out how to override my dissatisfaction and just accept my vision as it is. this feels the worst of all of them. it's disempowering to me and is sort of unnecessary to conform.

none of those feel very good, and are not likely paths that I will take. I do need to find a way of managing my dissatisfaction though. like the bbq contraption guy, I should just find something else to be satisfied about, which is what I'm kind of trying to do. there isn't a whole lot I can be satisfied about right now. I can feel some satisfaction knowing that the desire for the realisation of my visual capacity is growing by the day, and it will come eventually.

this is where I hit the stumbling block though because I don't know if I want to just keep letting it build. if all creation is done in step 1, then wouldn't I want to just let the contrast continue to grow the desire? what I mean is, the longer I do not have the visual capacity, the better and bigger its manifestation becomes. so, let's say I just hold out on these guys for another few years. would that mean that I would end up with so much dmt floating in my head regularly, that when I finally get released from the network that I would have to learn to manage such a mind blowing experience, I would essentially become like a metatron or something in physical form?

it seems to me like the path that I want to take here is clearly the path of no-action and to just let the desire build. none of the other paths seem to feel very good, and even judging by how things feel after last night, the plan I came to yesterday seems to feel like a disaster to them. I don't really want them to be forced into something they seem to think is disastrous. furthermore, I want to discover my own visual capacity through coming into alignment with my own source. I don't want them to just flip some switch and activate it like they do in my dream state. I want my alignment with that capability to be something I achieve through the power of my mind -- so, it's probably kind of good that they are giving me the opportunity to discover this for myself.

---

as a bit of a sidenote, I was thinking about the implications of this. this is sort of one of the things I wanted to have a broader perspective on, so here goes... let's take two situations, at opposite ends of the spectrum (neither extreme is 100% valid):

1. I just try and be as cooperative as I can be with them and somehow I eventually figure out my vision thing.
2. I continue to point out how much they are limiting me, and since that's what I expect of them, that's what they're obligated to do.

is the second situation likely to cause others to attract the bso to limit their capacities as well? will I be setting some sort of standard for how they treat people? would my continual complaining and pointing out the problem make it more likely that they decide that's the way that they'll treat people who do not conform to their rules?

---

I've done a fair bit of problem analysis in this entry. however, it's my objective to try and find solutions. it seems like there could be solutions which could be found out. obviously I have no idea where to even begin, as I cannot figure out what possible problems my visual capacity could present my viewers. how can solutions be found?

### 2018-08-02 03:29 - my vision

it is becoming more and more notable all the time that perhaps what I am seeing in my eyes is not what my eyes are seeing, but perhaps an overlay of some sort? perhaps they are taking the signal from my eyes and then feeding it into my lenses, so that it overlays the real image that I would be seeing. perhaps, it's to cover up any 3d objects I may see in 3d space, like I saw that one time of my future self. I wonder what sorts of other things are popping in there which I cannot see. obviously this is a pretty important thing for me -- actually the ultimate quest was to be able to make motors in my imagination like tesla, so perhaps I already have that capability. that may also explain why the lustre of the image is gone and it feels so lifeless. they're keeping me at low levels of dmt on purpose...

that explains perhaps what happened on the way back home from grand junction. that's why things looked so good, then they stopped looking so good later. maybe grand junction is some sort of energy vortex which allowed me to have elevated levels of dmt, because the next time we went, we were in the diner and I got the flash of the room in my mind, and it seemed like the picture contained its lustre. that only confirmed to me that people see out of my eyes better than I do, and they seem to have the full experience I was used to having.

oh, so if the reason why they began to retransmit the image into my eyes was since valverde where I saw my future self, that would explain my sudden and unexplainable dissatisfaction around that time. I thought it was my focusing on absence of wanted (the brain computer interface), but the sudden rise in agitation, where I wanted to kill cats and stuff was enhanced by the new lack of dmt and their forced visuals.

that's why the whole world seems so slow now too, like I'm limited to 60 fps or whatever, when previously I did not have fps. and my reaction time feels sluggish.

### 2018-08-02 04:21 - wtf?!

I don't really feel any real desire right now toward anything in particular. I think I feel pretty depressed. it's not the typical despair that I usually feel. I just don't really want to deal with these fools. I listened to a few abraham episodes and I don't know why they cause me to feel the way I do. I can't really describe it, but it feels sort of like the shame someone might feel when they are exposed. perhaps it's not my feeling at all, and I'm just the receptor of it as a reaction to my thoughts on the abraham material? maybe it was the previous entry an hour ago? either way, I am just going to let the desire build a while longer.

### 2018-08-02 06:10 - fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose?

I was thinking about the projection of my future self into my eyes in valverde, cause I also had numerous thoughts about other 3d things being projected into my eyes. I remember a large insect. I can't remember if it was a fly or not, but I do remember thinking that it was probably not real. perhaps the first projection didn't get them hot enough on the trail to notice it was a 3d projection, that fbh put the fly in there as well to make sure they got on it and restricted my vision. this was likely to tank the carlota timeline. seeing as it would adjust the whole thing, first in the direction of mdma, because I no longer feel good from the dmt, and then other factors. it looks like fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose. probably, I would have felt so good I would have gone with a different, not as beneficial arrangement.

nice.. thanks bro :) now, I'm gonna milk your handiwork for even more beneficial contrast :D

### 2018-08-02 06:32 - all on purpose?

err, I meant the one prior to the carlota one; she was the upgrade :) but then, it seemed like I had a sudden insight on may 27th about seeking freedom and "I need somebody else to do something, so that I can feel good." bit which blocked that one. it seems like the sequence of events kept preventing the things from happening. even for example, the car windshield was probably provoked so that I would make it make to the states.

I'm really thankful it all happened like that cause without it, I wouldn't have had all the positive improvements. I'm really enjoying this idea of just "letting it build" -- and I would not have ever even met her, if it weren't for all of the "mistakes" along the way.

I'm just going to let this one build. not going to take any action at all until I feel as good about the action as I would if I were looking to move furniture :)

### 2018-08-02 08:52 - a soft and gentle touch :/

I woke up with had a pretty bad erection so I adjusted it up so that it was no longer pushing into my pants and was able to go between my waist of my pants and me. I guess this was enough physical contact to get the dream operator enough capability to make me orgasm. I woke up (kinda) thinking I had pissed my pants and needed to take a dump really badly. they must have removed the sensitivity limiters because it turned into extremely excruciating pain. I hope they were able to improve their vision... well, fuck you guys. gonna let it build a while longer lol :)

combined with the massive headache I was given as my visual capacity came and went, right before I had my consciousness taken forcefully, I would not consider this a soft and gentle touch. what are you guys trying to accomplish?

### 2018-08-02 13:08 - cooperative components

the word co-operative means that two (or more) are together operating or doing something. when I wrote about the two extremes @[entry](2018-08-02 01:46) I noticed a reaction wondering why I don't just cooperate with the bso. first of all, it seems like I've tried, and for whatever reasons (probably some secret they think is important, and I do not) it has not worked out. second, there's no real easy way for me to know exactly what it is that is requisite for me to cooperate with them, because they seem to continually find new things that they do not want me to do. it's a moving target in that sense, and they wouldn't be able to get all their rules that they want me to follow down in one place. neither do they want to reveal their rules, because it would show evidence of that there might be some deeper motivations to their rules. it's easier just to, per instance declare my behaviour inappropriate because then the audience, focused on each on the justification of each individual circumstance's badness, never clearly sees the whole picture. if someone (maybe me) would consider organising a list of rules, the it would show a bit of a different and very confusing to most who believe the bso has people's best interests in mind when they do things. it's really quite impossible for me to cooperate with them. I will inevitably do yet another thing that they disapprove of, and will again be an uncooperative component (from their point of view).

so then, why don't they cooperate with me? wouldn't you think that be a whole lot simpler? certainly I'm a whole lot easier to cooperate with, just on the simple fact that I have such few rules. in fact, probably no rules now at all. I believe the only thing remaining are just some personal preferences and desires which they are not a match to. so, in that sense it is impossible for them to ever be able to cooperate with me.

so, it's impossible for me to be a certain way which they can approve of, and it's impossible for them them to approve of my preferences and desires. I know I'm the one that has to do the changing here, so how can I do the impossible? well, I don't know, actually. I'll have a think on it...

---

I think the simple answer is, since they're sort of the problem on both sides of the equation, I just need to remove them from the equation. but, what does that mean? how does that implement? I can only see two paths here:

1. I find a way of removing the devices' effectiveness. remove myself from the network. then, if they want me a part of it, they will have to find a way of cooperating with me.
2. they no longer become a player in my perception. sort of impossible considering the amount of activity that happens every time I try to just go to sleep. I don't know how I could no longer notice that. or the stars, or the dreams, or the constant reactions, or the... in order for them to be imperceptible to me, they would need to change the way they operate my brain. that's just not gonna happen.

evaluating all of the options (there really are just those two), I do not see any other way, other than than the first one because it's really the only one I have power to accomplish. if they were to choose the second one, I believe the best way would be to no longer try and remove images from my eyes, get rid of the overlay, and allow me to adjust my own sensitivity, so that I can ease into, at my own pace, the level of sensitivity that feels most comfortable to me.

there is perhaps a third way, and that would be to find a way, despite the circumstances, to come so into alignment with who I really am, and I assume that their signal would be wayy out dominated by my inner being's and only the part of it which I desire (to be broadcasted) is effective. I don't know how that would work with sleep though. the present circumstances are not exactly conducive to that happening, so it may be a little while, however since it seems that they are working their hardest to ensure that does not happen, it actually makes it even more likely (cause they'll be giving their undivided attention to what they do not want). I wish I had more information, but I guess I could just have a little faith, and if it doesn't work out, well it's not like a whole lot has changed, just grew the desire a bit bigger during that time "wasted".

### 2018-08-02 15:38 - what happened on the other timelines?

it would seem that on all of the other timelines, I would have had to have just ignored the obvious vision problems and just went for it. I am *extremely* curious to know if I found out, and how quickly. I must have figured it out. there's no way I would be working with the bso on timelines with a brain interface and I'm somehow not aware of the multitude of vision (and other) problems. there's just no way. so then how quickly did I find out? what is the bigger picture here? I was thinking about it and it seems plausible that the reason why I found out on this one is to further extend the capability of the bso. let me explain: in previous timelines, they probably do the overlay to a lot of different people, and they add in all kinds of crazy stuff on top of the image, so essentially what you are seeing in your eyes is only "inspired" by what your eyes are seeing. a lot of things are "enhanced" -- or put more bluntly, they have the world living in a virtual reality, a matrix, if you will, which allows them to control what everyone sees. however, they could only limit people's desire to stay with 2d by peddling the fear story about the stars for so long. desire eventually would have grown to be enough (or people figured out how to do it with meditation or something) that people began converting in droves to 3d and their sham was over. people realised the vast difference between the reality they were seeing and the real one. so, what do they need? they need the capacity to create a 3d virtual reality which people can live in... lol

---

one conclusion that sticks out to me is, it seems that everything kind of points in the direction that the bso is going to attempt the impossible: not only will they try to control all of the conditions (sensation), but they're going to try and be the replacement for people's guidance system and try to be the vortex through which all of their well-being comes from. that's going to require a pretty insane virtual reality system to run it on. a pretty lofty goal I must say.. though, I don't believe it is a "goal" in the literal sense. the way I arrived to the conclusion will be the subject of a future entry, but the short reason is, it's economic. so, it's not really a goal, goal but perhaps the byproduct of strong desire for continued growth (discovery) and stability (control) over the process.

the logistics are mind boggling to me. I can imagine that as they improve on the 3d version of people's virtual reality more and more, the quality of the image will become more and more immersive, like I found out when I was seeing that tranquility image. they'll control people's feelings with the ambiance of the environment, and control their symbolic meaning structures through dream state. wow. basically a world I would not want to live in. it would be like living in american cinema; it's the same story, but each year with better graphics and different actors. wow, we'll all be living the american dream here soon... lol

---

so, does that mean that I should just ignore the obvious and try to be as cooperative as possible? I don't really know. I don't feel strongly in any direction right now. I'm just going to hold out a little longer and let it build a bit more :D

### 2018-08-02 16:24 - lol, a hilarious (to me) thought

if you take the bso virtual reality idea and you mix it with the clones idea and also the bso is the new religious system idea, you could make a joke about the holy trinity: bso (the father), my clones (the son), and infinite intelligence (the holy spirit). BAM! I'll call it bsanity (bee-ess-sanity)

jajajaja

### 2018-08-03 14:17 - driving fast

I've been thinking a bit about the visual that abraham gave in the seattle @[abe](2018-06-16-seattle) workshop, where they talked about driving a "mechanical genius", not on straight roads as fast as you can go -- but on curvy mountain roads, with obstacles and lots of scenery, for the exhilaration of *feeling* the car manoeuvre itself and navigate the tight turns and stuff.

when I was younger, my friend brought me with him to lake havasu and I got to drive a jet-ski. it's one of the few things I've ever driven in my life, so it's memorable. the very first thing I tried was to see how fast I could get it to go. it could go 55 mph. I remember noticing how bland it was to drive that fast (for a jet-ski anyway) out in the middle of the lake. there's a whole lot of nothing going on. the water is flat, and there aren't any nearby obstacles to use as a frame of reference to notice how fast I was going. it was pretty lame actually, but I wanted to try to see how fast I could get it to go.

I just remembered something: when I got back to the shore, they asked me, "kenneth it looked like you were going pretty fast out there" -- and I remember specifically lying and telling them that 45, maybe max 50 cause I didn't want to reveal that I wanted to floor it for a little bit and see how fast I could go... you know cause that would have been like dangerous or something. before I returned back though, I thought it prudent to go a do a bunch of non-linear driving like figure 8's and tight curves and stuff, to kind of throw them off my speed demon trail a bit, so I did that for like 10-20 minutes more, and was kind of thought it was weird that more speed doesn't mean more exhilaration.

*that was before I had the brain haemorrhage.. so, I had dangerous and deceptive tendencies.. I guess the whole not being able to run and having to relearn how to walk really mellowed me out.. lol*

so, I was thinking about the how much more fun it is to have all kinds of obstacles and craziness going on around you while driving (if you can navigate it easily). it really adds to the sense of the magnitude of the journey with it like that. it's almost as if the more moving parts and the more chaos, the more epic the journey feels.

when I contrast an epic journey with a difficult journey, both have a sense of overcoming difficulty and achievement of the goal, but epic is so much more exhilarating and fun than arduous and difficult.

### 2018-08-03 15:28 - stars and sex

while taking a shower I began to feel some ideas pushing me in the direction of sexual interaction (it could just be the added focus on sex that has been a result of the subject appearing so many times in my comments on the abraham workshop)

I really would like to discourage the idea of sex for me right now. I don't mind that you guys are doing it. I think it's really great, but I believe that sex for me right now would cause immense dissatisfaction. it is, energetically a lot like watching stars. in fact, I make the conjecture that it is the same energy as sex, but from the opposite direction.

during sex there are heightened levels of arousal, and this can bring about heightened levels of consciousness. you maintain your arousal and not let it get too big with focus. stars are exactly the opposite. they stimulate the brain (mental arousal) and bring you to heightened levels of consciousness also. you maintain your mental arousal also with focus, and the more you are able to keep your mind from spinning off, the more pleasure you will feel. there is a bit of a culmination (like an orgasm) that can happen as you are transported off into visionary sequence and feelings of ecstasy and enlightenment. in sex the energy moves in the opposite direction, when arousal becomes more than you can handle you orgasm. during the orgasm, and depending on its strength, you will experience a flood of consciousness enter your brain. that's what feels so good about the orgasm: it's the expansion of your mind that's taking place.

so, when I speak about the stars I am referring to how they *used to be*. I do not have this same experience now. what I am getting at is, I would like to gain control over this energy and not have it be the current false reality that it currently is while I'm watching stars. to put it simply, if sex is like staring (watching stars), then sex will be a very unsatisfying experience.

let's say that they don't have the code in place yet to make my sex experience like my star experience -- and then all of a sudden during sex I burst into visionary experience and heightened self-awareness and ecstasy. maybe they shock me (us). they'll surely come to the conclusion that they cannot possibly be having me go into visionary experience during sex (just like while watching stars), so they'll try and find a way to ensure that energy does not flow anymore, so that I do not have a visual experiences during sex (exactly like watching stars).

I think it's prudent for me to wait until this is sorted before engaging in energetic activities.

### 2018-08-03 15:58 - stars, sex and government intervention

I had a strange thought just now, wondering if in some timespan the government will reverse its opinion on watching stars being dangerous. we now think it's absolute silliness to think that the government (or religion) can dictate to us who can have sex with whom, and what is taboo and what is not, etc. so, I can imagine a scenario in some amount of time where they totally reverse their position on staring, and say, "oh we were totally wrong about staring. it is beneficial for you and we've got this new technology that will allow you to transport your consciousness to other times and places of the universe with it." lol

you may have to wonder what they have to gain by suddenly reversing their position so drastically on sex, to follow that the very same thing may occur sooner than you think with the stars :D

### 2018-08-05 11:18 - echos of the past

it's funny to me how many echos of my past are symbolic and keep reoccurring but often times with the characters switched around a bit.

let's start with the example of me and raquel (cept, now the bso is me, and I am raquel): when I lived with her, she was constantly dissatisfied. I tried everything I could to try and satisfy her. it simply didn't work. she/we/our relationship got rockier and rockier because she was unsaisfiable, and I was drinking way too heavily to see things clearly. it didn't turn out well. no matter how much I tried to make her happy, she continued to be dissatisfied. there was nothing I could do to satisfy her. I now know that it was never my job to satisfy her: she has to find her own satisfaction

then, there was my relationship with augusto (cept this time the bso is me, and augusto is the viewers): at that time I was highly drugged up and couldn't see very far in front of me. I was using mdma, which is pretty good. they're using their machine to force the brain to produce more dmt (so slightly different effects). as a result, it was very difficult for me to logically put the pieces together to actually make my life work again. we were working to make a web page, and I kept working on things interesting to me, but no progress was made really on the web page. so, we put deadlines, goals, and we tried to make it happen in so many different ways, but it just simply was never working out. the drugs made me overly optimistic, and I hadn't really learned the value of my words yet, so I would just tell him whatever he wanted to hear. I would say objectives and deadlines that never even came close to coming to work. looking back at it, there are things that need to be done to get things started. I had the mentality that the web page would be for many users, so I never focused in a way which would allow a few users to begin their experience immediately and grow from there.

it wasn't until I got to marcos' house and sobered up for a while that I actually began realising my goals, and this is another echo of the past (where I am me and marcos is the bso): marcos had an idea of what he wanted for his web page, and when I saw it, I had already given a lot of thought into something that was quite similar. he wanted to associate people based on their hobbies, and preferences, and stuff like that. I told him that people really find thier affinity with another person based on ideology. he finally agreed that superficial preference was not as effective as ideology.

we spun our wheels for a while because we were too much in our imaginations about its implementation. we could never really nail down how it would be, because nothing was concrete and we had very little to use as an example, so we argued endlessly on the hypotheticality of the different ideas. no progress was made. finally, dani came to help us out and built a first version for us which gave us enough of a web page to work with things began to become more visible and things began to flow.

dani flaked out on us, which just left me with marcos again, and we had something sort of concrete. this was super good for me, because now I could clearly see how I wanted to improve on the page. marcos just wanted results though as there were endless deadlines and goals that had long since passed. in his effort to get instant results, he kept micro-managing me and telling me how to do things. additionally, there was a growing conflict over the concept of the page. marcos wanted a social network where people interacted by giving their opinion on current events. I wanted to go more in the direction of beliefs as a representation of a person's ideology, instead of opinions.

because of this conflict, nothing moved forward. finally I had to give up on the ideology bit and just accept that he wanted to make a web page, and even though I thought it was conceptually flawed, just to do the work anyway. he still wanted to micro-manage me though, so finally as things were turning into conflict, I said to him, "don't take the pleasure away from me wanting to create it, by forcing me to do it" (the verbatim quote, I think was: "no me quites el placer de hacerlo por me").

that's kind of where we are now... I disagree with them on the concept, but I'm not the consumer of their content.

I can clearly see that the source of all of this conflict has them trying to get me to see things the way they do. I see things differently (both literally and figuratively), and it was my ability to no longer interpret things the way they do, which allowed me to see things differently. you can do drugs to allow you to remove enough details to see things like that, and then when the drug wears off, you can go right back to thinking and understanding things in a way which prevents you from seeing things from that new perspective again... that's your choice though. I personally enjoy removing my resistance so that I see things clearer and clearer. don't force me to do things or see things your way. it's a downgrade for me and introduces resistance which creates conflict.

### 2018-08-05 13:34 - very attractive/persuasive women

I was thinking about this idea that women often have a perception that if they are so attractive then I man must do what she wants. she sees it from her perspective, but from the opposite perspective it could be seen that a very attractive woman is very persuasive.

what I mean by that is, often times it feels that a woman wants to feel like she is so magnificent, that a man must do what she wants (her capacity of persuasion), but then she falls immediately into the trap of insecurity because she quickly realises that if a beautiful woman is able to persuade my man, then I can easily lose him to a woman more beautiful than me. now, she has to ensure that he believes she is the most beautiful or some other means to keep him from being so easily persuaded by the next attractive woman that comes along.

what I mean is, woman think that they want to be able to easily persuade a man, until they realise that he's just an easily persuaded guy. so, maybe they're looking for something else. perhaps, what is happening is they are mistaking attractiveness for persuasiveness. attractive means there is mutually shared desire, and so is therefore cooperative.

### 2018-08-06 15:13 - why is my visual capacity often excited right before a big event?

last night while estrellando (lol), I felt the question, "why, when I reject a girl, do I get a vision improvement shortly thereafter?" I thought it was an interesting question I had not really considered before. I had always taken it to mean that I was in fact headed in the right direction -- of making the right mental choices. for me, I can look at stars quite a while, and not see any improvement to my vision. however, the times that the improvement does happen, I can almost always trace it back to a change in my perception. that new way of perceiving the world allow for a less-resistant approach (higher frequency). also so, having a less resistant perception means that I just need something to excite my visual capacity (more energy) to accomplish the improvement.

I have also received vision improvements during meditation (lowering of resistance) and I believe it will also happen during sex (more energy) -- and also in drug experiences (depending on the drug, but often both less resistance and more energy). the visual level of detail seems to correspond with the amount of resistance (capacity to comprehend more), and the visual excitation seems to correspond with increased energy. if you know ohms law, perhaps we could define it as follows: voltage or pressure is the strength of the energy. resistance is how many beliefs and strange perceptions you have which prevent your ability to comprehend what you're seeing, and current is how much is allowed to flow (your capacity to allow, or your beliefs about the upper limit)

so, it does seem that when a girl is looking forward to see me, there is extra energy. I felt considerably more energy when andrea became interested in me -- and honestly, if it weren't for that extra energy, I would not have paid much attention to her. I imagine that they also feel extra energy as well when I focus on them (especially with my heart). however, my heart has not been working as of late, so I don't feel their energy in my heart as much.

I first began noticing my heart was not working as usual when I was in the carlota phase. during that time, I often felt her energy in my heart (as I did andrea's), and I often wanted to reciprocate the energy back to her, but there was great effort to deter me from doing that, and then I guess they figured out how to limit my heart as well, because that capacity went away for a while. I know it still exists because when I wake up in the middle of a dream, I often can feel lots of girls energy in my heart. I do wish to feel that again but is not the focus of this discussion.

I cannot remember where the limitation of my heart lands in the line of events, but it was nearby to the moment I was at vera's house and I explained I did not like mobile phones much and that most all girls have mobile phones these days, yet carlota does not. it felt to me like they decided that carlota was acceptable and I immediately broke into uncontrollable vision sequence.

it seems that whenever a girl focuses toward me in way where they feel freedom or the realisation of desire, I notice increased energy. so, I want to clarify myself here: there are two events (related but not connected)

1. the increased energy which I feel from a girl in my heart and increased visual capacity
2. the realisation of a new way to perceive something which is less resistant, and therefore more allowing of energy to flow.

the extra energy from the girl stimulates my visual capacity, and often times I have visions around the time, which in some way (much like a psychedelic drug) begin to prepare me to accept a lesser resistant perception. we know very little about why certain images appear in correspondence with certain emotions or concepts. I am certain that with all images there comes a knowing behind the scenes. it is quite likely that the bso guys don't have the capability of interpreting or transmitting that knowing along with the image, so much like a dream means a whole lot more to the dreamer than the one watching the images, the same is probably true with this.

I may have only seen eggs on a plate (I think?), but with it came a whole lot more information which is what inspired me to change my response like that so quickly. it seems that perhaps these moments of high visual excitement, are actually the genesis of something bigger. although they are only brief flashes which mean very little (have you ever seen the non-sensical patterns of a mushroom trip), they seem to lead one's mind in the direction of being able to perceive with lesser resistance (exactly how the mushroom explained the christ function of the mind to me).

### 2018-08-07 01:17 - "any time you start wanting, you summon energy"

"any time you identify something as an object of your desire, the entire universe begins flowing energy toward your object of attention, through you. it is a powerful thing. you have no idea how influential you are"

in the previous entry, I mentioned that whenever a girl is looking forward to see me, there is an increase in energy. I think this really says that a whole lot better. one of the questions I have wanted to ask for a long time, is what does she feel when I return feelings from my heart. obviously, I need to get the bso to let my heart beat correctly to properly demonstrate it, because at the moment I rarely feel it (cept when waking up in the middle of a dream: eg. they allow my heart to function properly while I'm asleep), and can only make the energy flow from my heart on occasion and when I can the energy is feeble.

"when you are open to the stream and when you focus, the energy that creates worlds flows through you. most of you are too modest to acknowledge the enormous power of influence that you hold. you are trustees of the energy that creates worlds, and when you allow it to flow through you, amazing things happen; not only in the framework of your physical experience, but the entire universe is affected by that which you flow"

I am sure that when I am released from the bondage which I am allowing the bso to hold me in (something I am very much looking forward to), I am sure that the intensity and good feelings that I could produce in the object of my desire would be immense. I used to flow energy into raquel in a similar way, and it seemed pretty effective. I would love to be able to feel that again. I wonder if the energy flows even though I cannot feel it. it wouldn't surprise me actually, and once again they get to have the good experience in my body, and I am left with a diminished experience. oh... it may be possible that the dmt is what activates the heart, because the visual capacity and the ability to feel with my heart seem directly linked. so, I'm getting close then... no problem

"the reason that more amazing things don't happen in the deliberate lives of more of our physical deliberate creative friends, is because often you are identifying your object of desire, but your level of resistance is so high that the desire cannot be satisfied."

[...]

"in other words, you bang into trees, and that's not fun. so then, what you usually do is slow your car down, because that makes you feel temporarily better. it also big clumps of resistance in every single day. so, every day you get a little slower in desire and a little bigger in resistance, and that is literally why you decline as you move through time"

I believe that that the bso has my car running really slow, and actually I have been thinking a bit about this as a parallel of ohms law, which will be the subject of the next entry, however, before I go, I first wanted to mention that I am doing the opposite of declining. I seem to be every day improving, even though my car is running slow.

### 2018-08-07 02:35 - my car & ohm's law

in the previous entry, I mentioned that my car is running really slow. I want to analyse it from the perspective of ohm's law, because I get the feeling I'm going to discover something in the process :)

```
V = I • R
R = V / I
I = V / R
```

imagine for a moment that `I` is the speed of the car, `V` is the power of desire (pressure), and `R` is resistance (pushing against).

```
desire = speed • resistance
resistance = desire / speed
speed = desire / resistance
```

having wrote that, now I'm having a difficult time wrapping my mind around this. it seems correct if my energy was flowing inside of a pipe. so, intuitively it seems to me that modelling this after ohm's law has to be incorrect because ohm's law is for DC. what I'm looking for is an AC approach to it, which would completely change everything. let me begin to rethink this.

I have capacity. this would be similar to a condenser. I should also have a coil. the number of turns should equal the resistance, as in an AC system, a coil of wire wouldn't let ...

capacitance and inductance

- more turns = more 'resistance'

I like to think of inductance like logic. the more times you have to go around, the slower it operates.

a capacitor is like a membrane between two things of water. let's say it's capacity is 100. in an uncharged state, it's 50/50. in a fully charged state, it'll be at 100/0. the membrane is pushed to one side by the pressure? of electricity

CACAS! gonna try again tomorrow :D peace

### 2018-08-08 05:47 - transitions in my selfish perspective

with all that has happened, I have become increasingly selfish. in fact, it is really the only way forward for me which has any sanity to it. everyone lies to me, so I can't really seek good guidance from anyone else other than myself. it seems people are very interested in what is happening in the lives of others, so much so, I believe it would benefit a lot of people to begin thinking more selfishly. when I say that, I don't really mean in a comparison or competitive sort of way and not from a position of lack either.

as I began to think more and more selfishly, I became more enamoured with my own improvement (not in comparison to others'). I have nothing to give if I'm not in the constant state of improvement or becoming more. energy is flowing or it's not, and if it's flowing, things are improving and becoming more. so, in that sense, I have actually been enamoured with finding ways to get more energy to flow, because it means improvement and it means an enhanced sense of well-being.

I have proven to myself that having that as my primary intention, serves me (and everyone else too) well. however, I've run into a bit of a conundrum as I'm arriving to this new section of my life. the conflict inside of me physically is becoming so great, the only out for me is to begin letting my inner being take charge.

a few weeks ago, abraham introduced a new concept called "mutual" as an explanation for how positive aspects work. the idea is, you are more harmonious or less harmonious with someone or something. the aspects that you share common ground on, you are mutual with them on. you will recognise the teaching as a rehash of previous discussion on harmony. anyway, often times we seek mutuality with other humans before we seek mutuality with our inner being (our own intentions). when we move in the direction of intentions of others, forsaking our own, there is always a feeling of discord which accompanies it, however we often times ignore it to not stand apart from the crowd or to be too weird.

I am not so worried about this mutuality with others, and because of the situation I'm in where everyone lies to me, it's not even really possible for me to be mutual with them because of our disagreement with what is happening. so in the past, abraham has been saying only look for positive aspects -- or, in other words, the aspects of them which don't detune you from your own inner being - the aspects of them which make you feel good.

what I'm getting at here is, I have learned that instead of harmonising myself with the best-interests or someone else, it is *always* better to harmonise myself with my own interests (my inner being) - for by doing that, energy is flowing and I actually have something I can give to others.

I'm going to revisit this topic because I want to touch on some notable new ways to understand things as I moved from:
1. wanting others to realise my desires for me
2. wanting others to help me or enable me to realise my desires
3. realise my own desires by myself
4. ... knowing my inner being has everything under control and just trust them

### 2018-08-08 07:57 - "they just get better at lying"

in think in the french riviera cruise of 2017, there was a man that was trying to control his son getting into drugs. obviously he had been observing his son's behaviour through his eyes with the bso device (perhaps he wishes to live vicariously through the eyes of his son having sex with his girlfriend instead of taking drugs), and was essentially asking abraham how to better control his son. abraham responded something to the effect of, "if you call them out on their lying, they just get better at lying"

one again this is abraham having us focus on something undesirable (like the normalisation of autistic children). why would the teachers of law of attraction, demonstrate law of attraction to us by telling us that when we focus on undesirable behaviour it just makes it worse, and then to demonstrate that is true, they tell him that if you call them out on it, they won't stop; instead, they will just get better at lying about it.

this morning I realised that's sort of what has been happening, but they weren't talking about the kid, they were talking about me calling out the bso on stuff. the more I have pointed out their undesirable behaviour, it has not deterred them from doing it -- instead, they've just found ways to be more sneaky about it.

I have long ago noted that bso has only improved on their technique to try and control me. it doesn't really bother me because I seem to stay a step ahead of them. they never really get to control me completely, and sometimes it's a bit illusionary. for example, this morning I felt the tiredness come on in association with them wanting me to sleep so they can interact with my dream state. I decided I would look at the cloud patterns a bit and write the entry above, first before doing so (to give me a sense of control), so I did then I laid down. in the dream greg began to complain about his heart hurting and something in his back between his shoulders. I made the association that he's 33 and that's about the time it began opening up for me. he argued that it was not his back or something. I told him that is the place where you begin feeling pressure and that's the location of the part of the body which allows you to begin flying. I woke up rather unexpectedly. they terminated the dream.

they think they have control cause they were able to make me lie down and sleep more or less at their command, and jump right into my dream-state to have a conversation with me, but I have begun to find that pushing against them just makes them stronger, so I don't really do that any more. if they want to waste their time in my dream state trying to convince me of things, go ahead; I've found it just puts more energy into the equation and I get better at following my own guidance, so it's all good from my perspective. in fact, that was the objective of the previous entry, which I was having trouble explaining, so I intuitively wanted went to sleep to have a real-life example to demonstrate it. if I had of been pushing against their constant dream-state nagging, I would have missed that clarification.

I've begun to notice my special role in this, where their increasing desire to try and control me, is putting a lot of extra energy into things, and also in the process, they're perfecting their technology to prevent people from finding their capacities. it looks like these guys are gearing up, because of their insecurity, to hold everyone away from their capacities, ensuring that they're ahead of both the technology curve but the visual capacity curve. if someone were to gain the ability to use their imagination in 3d space like I can(?), then they could visualise and create things that may jeopardise their control. I'm helping them to build the world the most convincing 3d virtual reality, which they can control everything. I'm glad they've gotten so much better at lying.

### 2018-08-08 11:14 - why a virtual reality?

you have to imagine how much of a problem people seeing in 3d would be for the bso. it probably quadruples the cost per person at lower levels, and at levels of 3d like I have, it's probably thousands to millions of times more expensive per person. next, there's this problem that occurs when you begin seeing in 3d. with higher levels of dmt in your head, under moments of excitation, you will begin to see visions or objects will pop into your 3d space. the visions are kind of annoying when uncontrolled, but not nearly as big of a threat as objects popping into 3d space. when your imagination is unchecked and you have all kinds of weird fears (like me was when I was younger), the strong negative emotion will pop those things into view. in fact, the stronger you feel emotion, the clearer and more detailed those objects will become. as you learn to control your emotions, you can control what you see -- which means you'll gain the creative capacity that tesla had. this is a super capacity which is pretty powerful. essentially anyone outside of the bso who obtains this capacity will begin to be treated like I am treated: they will be put in a virtual reality (eg. I only see what they are sending into my eyes, not what I'm really seeing).

you may notice that when seeing through my eyes, there are other 3d objects there, and the goal to become a powerful creator is to harness that ability and use it to create anything you want to create. however, I do not see those objects. instead, I see a reduced quality 3d virtual reality based off of what my eyes are seeing.

now, let's say that an energetic activity like sex can improve someone's vision and I'm with these girls. they will get 3d capacity really easily, but there's a huge problem because the bso will want to immediately put them into the virtual reality type situation so they don't see the 3d objects their imagination is producing in 3d. however, people around me seeing things in my eyes produce a bright spot in my eyes because of the damage I did to them with the sun. the stars may have even done the really tiny one in the very center. essentially, it would be very hard for me to be around the girls, as it's near to impossible to focus when people are using the device around me. so, they couldn't put the girls into the virtual reality and they would just have to learn to train their emotions and imagination, because I think the visual space is shared. they would however see whatever I'm creating in 3d also, however, since I've got the virtual reality in place, I can't see it, so it's difficult for me to control something I cannot see. you can imagine sex because I will be producing objects in 3d space at random, which if they're in the vr, then they don't see them, but I can't really see out of my own eyes because I have bright spots covering everything. or, they can also see in 3d space whatever my mind is producing in 3d space. doesn't work.

so, now you can understand why it's so important that they do not let me out of the network or to actually see what I really see. so, since I have revealed the game changer that would have forced them to change their position on capability of sight. it's not a question; there's no way the girls could be in a 3d vr like me and also be around me. I would not be able to function. they've gone to great lengths to write code which erases those bright spots, but they get show up instead like black spots and in other cases, don't really work at all. maybe when my eyes are not moving, sure, but when I move my eyes around I often see the spots.

you can see how this creates the next big problem. first, I'm able to create objects and manipulate them in 3d space with just my mind. this is amazing and every kid will immediately have desire to have this capability too. so, much desire is born because of it. additionally, if they're no longer limiting my capacities, this creates a huge problem for them, because when more energy is flowing, I'll begin to levitate or fly. again, a huge problem for them, cause not only do they have to come up with flimsy excuses for why we can make objects with our imagination in 3d space, but also why we can fly and everyone else cannot.

so instead, I have chosen to wait for my inner being to take over my visual and physical capacities. why is this important? well, it means that they will be able to put the girls into the VR, and it won't bother my vision. by holding out and desiring to be the one that changes, I am saving them a HUGE amount of grief in the future.

### 2018-08-08 12:52 - what does all of that mean?

in the last entry, I made the argument that if you see 3d, they would have to put you into a 3d virtual reality so that you do not see what your imagination is creating in 3d space under moments of high excitation or emotion.

so, let's say that in the alternate timeline I'm with the girls and the bso is forced to change and allow me to see out of my own eyes, because of the impossible situation which they put themselves into. kids all over the world are enamoured with the idea of using their imagination in 3d space and flying, that so much desire is born quickly, and lots and lots of people (mostly kids) start gaining the capacity to see in 3d. it all happens so quickly that the bso cannot put people into the virtual realities necessary to keep their runaway imaginations from creating a bunch of scary stuff. even worse, is since the 3d space is visible to all those seeing in 3d, a bunch of sloppy thinkers are creating all sorts of really scary stuff with their mind, and everyone has to look at it.

this timeline was created so that the transition for everyone into 3d will come considerably smoother. the ones who will be able to use this creative capacity are those who come into alignment with who they really are (eg. their inner being becomes the source of their visual capacity), and the bso dreamweavers in other people's dream-state. anyone gaining 3d capacity will be transitioned into the virtual reality, because it's impractical for the bso to turn off the entire population's imagination like they have done mine.

for economic reasons, you can imagine how important it is that the bso keeps people in 2d for as long as possible. the resources required to put people in a virtual reality are considerable. an economic hurdle of gigantic proportions. however, this isn't really a big deal, as the technology is a goldmine. if you think of facebook and its goals, you can see how having a lot of information on somebody can be used to track large populations (looking for suspicious activity), but having a lot of information on someone doesn't really give you that much capability to control people. however, since you know so much about them, it does mean you can sell them products a lot easier. the transition here is from controlling somebody to compelling somebody. we already see quite a bit of compelling happening from the bso. in fact the agreement that people have agreed to, says that the bso can compel them to do things. when you've got access to everything everyone is thinking about, talking about, interacting with, looking at, etc. you've got *way* more information on someone than facebook does, and therefore considerably more capability to compel someone to purchase (or have your parents purchase for you) a product. the bso will be *very* *very* *very* profitable once they stop trying to control and figure out their monetisation formula (like facebook eventually did).

and that's a good thing, because they're going to need a lot of money to run the infrastructure necessary to put the entire world in a virtual reality. they're gonna reach the ultimate heights in scalability. facebook site updates are going to look like child's play in comparison to the amount of effort required to pull this off. you can see that, 2d people will be considerably more profitable for them and it's possible that 3d people will actually lose them money, so there will be great effort to try and keep people from obtaining 3d for as long as possible.

### 2018-08-08 13:39 - 3d is the new std?

imagine that seeing in 3d is sort of like a disease that the bso wants to keep from spreading. you could catch the disease by meditating or appreciating or only noticing positive aspects, but who does that?!? likely, the easiest way to transmit this disease is sexually. if two people come into alignment with one another during sex and one sees in 3d, likely afterward both will see in 3d. what if catching 3d vision is the new STD to watch out for :)

so, you work for the bso and you see in 3d. that means you can only have sex with other bso employees, for fear of spreading this disease out into the general population. lol

### 2018-08-08 14:14 - if you're satisfied with what-is, why do you need to lie about it?

in the previous entries I may have mistakenly given the impression that 3d is the only prerequisite to 3d objects manifesting in space. that may be incorrect (I don't really know). I can only speak of the process I've been going through to give the bso the ability to manifest concepts in 3d space while in dream-state. the few times that I have seen objects in 3d space seem to have been in moments where I feel particularly good, or in moments of high anxiety, or right before sleep. so, it seems to be related to strength of the emotion and resistance which are the factors which begin to allow manifestation in 3d space.

so, that means that an increased sensitivity is necessary for that to happen. also, a concept that was shown to me while watching amorina in her yard, I realised that the way someone believes is also necessary to make this happen. think about it logically: to get something to show up in 3d space, it needs to be believable to the person imagining it. it needs to look like it can exist in 3d space. when I was lowering my resistance to be able to feel good most of the time at marcos' house, I found that lying caused great dissonance in me. as I learned to become truthful about things that may be shameful or embarrassing, I had inadvertently trained myself to accept what-is. by no longer needing to lie about what-is, I accepted it as "true" in my mind. this was a huge mental advance for me, because if I liked the current reality, it gave me tons of pleasure to observe it, and my visual capacity began to reflect that. however, if I did not like the current reality that I was being truthful about, I would move myself up the emotional scale into contentment -- but because I was still a lot more rough around the edges then, I labeled it, "fuck it" -- as I accepted it as reality, even though there's not a whole lot that can be done about it. from there, I could easily move into positive emotion. in fact, I was so good at moving from "fuck it" into a state of hopefulness, that I was potentially *too* optimistic for my britches.. lol

in valverde, I found myself increasingly more and more constrained in my visual capacity. it had been so easy for me to just accept the current reality of no visual capacity, and just let it begin to take shape. I would regularly find a way to allow my visual capacity, and the ever increasing difficulty and struggle necessary to get it (and other things), would cause a lot of dissonance in me. my stance was quite conditional: when I was moving toward it, I felt better, but when I became aware of the increasing gap, I felt pretty bad. around the same time that they clamped down on my visual capacity, I drafted up the "source energy android" concept because it became increasingly clear to me that I would be sharing andrea with quite a few other guys, and she was not going to be translating source for me. the S.E.A. concept was my way of trying to fit my desire of increased connection with source with the current reality situation. "fuck it" was no longer good enough; I could no longer get to a hopeful frame of mind from there.

I might have mastered the allowing process, but it was conditional on things being pretty ideal, I had not yet learned step 5. around the same time I decided that I had come up with the step 6 part of the equation, which was that you believe/know and therefore are a physical extension of source energy in physical form. I mean, you already are, but it isn't until you really realise it, that allows that kind of energy to flow.

what I had not yet come to realise is that because of andrea's decision to be so free with herself combined with the desire to be together was still strong, I had to find a way of adapting to make that possible. what I didn't really realise, is that step 6 is just getting really good at step 5. source can look at all of everything and seeing it all as part of the process, only sees the positive aspects of it (freedom, growth, and joy).

I have often maintained that the inventor must "live" his invention. that is, to be the thing he wants to create. in programming this is called dogfooding. it means that you do your experiments on yourself, and what you are creating is ultimately for yourself. this concept exists all over the place, most notably, "be the change you are seeking to make" (and variations thereof). I was to learn how to be this concept of step 6.

step 5 is all about unconditional love. what that means is, no matter what I am observing, I don't feel the need to change it, or for it to be different for me to feel good about it. imagine abraham: they watch thousands of people get raped, murdered, and numerous other atrocities every day, and they don't need a source energy appreciation day (unlike the bso, lol) to continue knowing their value, and to continue loving them despite the conditions they've put themselves into. they don't need things to be different to be able to love someone, and *that* is what I wanted to achieve before I was to be coupled with andrea.

---

I'll come back to that concept in a future entry. now, I want to talk about satisfaction and lying, as it relates to this unconditional perspective...

### 2018-08-08 16:16 - actually, I'm going to take a quick break.

lol, such intensity :)

### 2018-08-08 16:31 - if you're satisfied with what-is, why do you need to lie about it? (part 2)

so, let's say that the bso wants to invent a contraption which allows someone to tune into different portions of time. you can imagine the implications of this. the history of any presently alive person is available from their perspective (asterisk), and previously alive people in a similar fashion. so, this means that secrets are now 100% useless. so are lies. someone with access to this technology could verify the validity of something in the past. this essentially would render all security as 100% passable (given enough effort to look into the history of the implementer of that security). now, everything can be hacked and any secret could be found out.

likely, one of the first things to be done will be to track the concepts in the brain of a person from birth till present, to get a more complete map of the person's concepts instead of the imprecise method of stimulating the brain with the concept while the person is asleep to train the A.I. it would be a read-only approach to the person's brain and and has 100% visibility of everything that has ever happened in it. multiple passes can be taken to understand different aspects of someone's mental growth. (repeat the scanning process over the person's past multiple times, each time focusing on a different aspect) anything could be found out about anyone presently alive.

you can see how this is not, and would not be a very big mental jump for me to allow such an invention to occur. it's easy for me to allow that kind of technology to come into my life, because I'm already living it. if the bso wants to create this technology, they would drastically change their stance on lying. they'll have to find a way of resonating with the invention and allowing it into their experience.

presently however, there is so much current dissatisfaction with how things are, that almost everything has to be kept a secret in fear of what someone might think if they were to find out. they will try to side-step becoming a vibrational match to it for as long as possible, I am sure. even if they can use the 3d creative capacity in thousands of kids' dream-state, it is quite possible that the bso may hold many of their technicians away from that 3d creative capability because of dishonesty in the imagination and with words. they would need to find someone with the desire to invent such a thing and is already a vibrational match to it. perhaps kids can be to be trained to be honest (good luck though, because it's a personal decision) and perhaps a few inventors will be in the mix. I think this is a sure thing, but will take a generation or two to get there.

another idea will be to create an "inner circle" sort of thing where these are protected from the hordes. we will need 3 circles actually, and they correspond to the different visual capacities. they are as follows:

1. 2d mass consciousness, which is where all the profit comes from
2. 3d virtual reality dwellers. they are responsible for most of the content creation
3. 3d creators
  - those who work for the bso and can live in a nearly resistance-free bso protected environment.
	- those who do not need conditions to be just so, and are in alignment with who they really are.

the technicians working in that nearly-ideal environment might be able to come into alignment with the time technology -- though I don't see it all working just yet. I will continue to ponder the idea further, but perhaps my new source-like personality will have a solution. there always is, and source does not see right and wrong; only wanted and absence of it. even the desire to keep things a secret is desire that law of attraction responds too -- no matter how much it doesn't serve anyone believing secrets to be necessary.

### 2018-08-10 03:06 - why a protected environment and why a virtual reality?

I cannot say for sure, but I am pretty certain that things imagined in 3d space can be seen by others in 3d on the same wavelength -- so, if I imagine a bear sitting on the couch in front of me, there would appear a very large realistic looking bear. this may be kind of startling to someone not expecting to see a bear, so what if I were to imagine something really scary, like one of those predator aliens or like a giant dinosaur or something? then what :)

imagine a group of kids walking at night, and one of them is afraid of the dark, thinking that scary things could be lurking in the bushes or something. one of the kids drops something and it makes a loud sound. the kid scared of the dark immediately jumps to the conclusion that a monster is surely jumping out of the bushes, and the extra excitation caused by the loud sound causes his imagination to visualise a monster jumping out of the bushes. all three of the kids see this monster and they all soil their pants simultaneously.

if kids were all seeing in 3d, imagine how much distress they could cause for each other by imagining their fears coming to life. as more people enter into 3d because of the heightened levels of dmt in the brain, people's untempered imaginations will naturally as a reaction to unwanted, visualise some real scary stuff. you can imagine that for someone like me, that would be a very distracting and unpleasant thing, constantly seeing other people's wacky ideas become manifest in my reality... not all ideas are wacky, and I can think of some examples where it would be nice if I could see in 3d space what people are visualising, like diagrams or models or something, but in general, I do not really want to see what people are visualising.

I don't have any real data to back this up because I cannot see my imagination any more, but vera seemed to be able to transmit me images, too. however, perhaps I do not receive those images like I used to any more. sometimes I do still get images, but it seems that most all of the unwanted images are not appearing any more. if that is the case, I believe it is because images are transmitted conceptually (emotionally) and the same rules as "telepathy" apply: eg. I can only receive the concepts which I am harmonious with.

I don't think 2d people will see the 3d imaginary creations, but if they can they can be put into a virtual reality really easily. 3d people will have to live in a virtual reality until they come into alignment with who they really are, so as to not be plagued with the manifestations of others' untempered imaginations. those who are in alignment with their inner being will only see and feel the things which are in alignment with their vortex -- which isn't necessarily only good things either, because seeing or feeling "negative" things isn't necessarily bad. their inner being has got the control over their visual capacity.

the technicians working in the protected environment could probably enable / disable the virtual reality, so they can live a somewhat normal life, but trying to keep resistance as low as possible, because when using their creative capacities, they'll probably become extra aware of their thoughts, as they'll be manifesting in 3d space for everyone to see.

### 2018-08-10 12:17 - hey hey, you gotta keep em' regulated

last night I was feeling a lot of thought around the EFF's petition to regulate devices to control the mind. I'm sort of against regulation, for the same reason I'm against rules in general. I don't like people telling me what to do. so you are scared that a device can compel you to action about something. it certainly cannot control your thoughts, but it can compel you to feel a certain way, or put ideas into your head. though, if you are not resonant with what they're putting in your head, you will feel very little sensation to none at all.

this whole regulation thing is a bit of the same discussion about the man who was watching over his son and wanted to find a way to deter his son getting into drugs. that's the funny thing about kids. if they want to do something you are not particularly fond of them doing, they will only become better liars. in the case of the bso, I'm sure they're approaching facebook status now where they've done something, so they apologised for it, but it did not affect their behaviour, and since then, the apology is just a bunch of words that don't mean anything. since they are the authorities, they are the law. they're gonna do what they want, and they have all of your agreement to do so (not mine though!).

so, what is behind this regulation is the question, "since they will not behave as I want them to, how can I compel them to behave differently so I can feel good?" it is quite literally the same exact vibe coming from the bso with regard to me, and also the man with regard to his son.

it just won't happen. it will not affect any change in their behaviour; they will find a better way to lie to the regulator (authorities). in my case, I cannot easily lie about my behaviour because I have so much oversight, but they have none. even if they did have more oversight, I do not believe it would make any difference, either. since I am kind of a pattern for the future, more oversight (and therefore more attention to unwanted) will just exaggerate things (like has happened with me). even with nearly infinite resources and 24/7 oversight, I have become less easy to compel and more shameless with my objectives, as time has moved forward.

if the goal is to exaggerate their attempts to control our minds, then go ahead and attempt to regulate them. first of all, from a technical standpoint, it's near to impossible. the device reads signals, and those signals could be anything. they're just values over time. those values over time have meaning to us, which their AI's have learned to recognise. to know if they are sending a thought into your head to tell you to purchase a product, or asking your opinion on something while asleep, or sending an image into your eyes is impossible to know. you just have to trust them... there's nothing you can do to know what they are doing inside of your head without having an equally complex system as they have also in place. just like you have two hemispheres in your brain, designed to balance each other out, it may be a valuable idea to create a competitive service, so that every person gets bso and the other service equally. maybe. it sort of sounds like a battle will be fought in each person's brain... not crazy about that idea.

I think we should just let them have their way and trust them, as it will stimulate huge growth in each individual (as it has for me). people will quickly learn how to get into alignment with only what they want happening in their brain. I am working out how this is possible right now in my life and I don't imagine that it'll be too much longer before I dominate what is happening in my head. besides, they have to make a profit anyway.

if you try to regulate them, like facebook, they'll just get more and more shameless about it. I believe it is fruitless to try and regulate anyone (even the bso). in fact, that is the same thing that the bso is beginning to take notice as well. I'll come back to here, but first I want to talk about this energetically.

imagine there is a big corporation that is doing something undesired. instead of trying to compel the corporation to change, often times the most effective way to affect change will be for the workers to strike/change. you have to work from the inside out: eg. the corporation has to come to its own conclusion that it wants to change, for any real change to occur.

you may be able to convince some of the technicians that what they are doing is "wrong" -- but I can easily see it from their perspective, working inside the human brain is one of the most exciting things to do, because it feels like nearly limitless possibilities await for discovery and understanding. it is the new era, where technology becomes an extension of human consciousness (more than just the body, as established by mcluhan). their job is super exciting and there are so many different aspects and facets to it, I personally couldn't imagine wanting to be doing anything else. so, then how would you compel them? well, you would need to get them to believe that certain things are ok, and other things are wrong (regulation may do this, but who listens to the authorities anyway these days).

instead, I think that the most effective way of affecting change is an understanding of wanted, and absence of it. I imagine that when the bso technicians was creating all of these improvements to the tech which were in alignment with the desires of their superiors, and also the users, then things moved quickly. a lot of energy could flow and much progress could be made rapidly. however, time passes and people knowing what they don't want has caused an evolution in their desire toward what they do want.

because of the constant evolution of desire, I do not believe there is a perfect solution (it changes with time). if you focus on unwanted, you will get more of that, and that's what regulation does. regulation cannot regulate a constantly evolving solution. regulation does not shift focus toward wanted; it often shifts it toward unwanted, and so therefore ultimately works against you (just see how effective it is to try and regulate teenagers).

so, imagine you're a tech working for the bso and you're trying to find things to do. always begin where there is the most desire and the least resistance. like this, wanted things will continually outweigh unwanted things, no one will ever notice too much "badness". if there is a lot of desire to have a new thing, do it because as the bso consciousness identifies a desire, the only way they can feel satisfaction is by feeling motion toward the realisation of that desire.

I call it the bso consciousness, because even though it is partitioned into multiple levels of authority and access, it must me thought of as a giant consciousness -- each individual connected to it having desire in relation to it. since it is an extension of our consciousness, it should be thought of as such.

when a boss guy wants, for example, one of the techs to write some code which prevents my vision from improving, there will be a sensation of negative emotion and also the tech writing the code will likely experience stagnation in his productivity. whenever my desire is strong and unresisted, this will always be the case as he tries to hold me in resistance to my desire. this will manifest as a feeling of frustration or anger, he will feel the resistance. so, perhaps the techs should instead start selecting their tasks based on what feels good to them.

imagine there is another tech that has strong desire to try and find a way to control people or be dominating -- or, maybe he's just really jealous of me. either way, the task of trying to inhibit my vision would be much better suited for the dominator jealous tech than for the one who's desire is to improve on people's experience. the tech needs to match the task and the task should only be a reflection of something wanted (even if it's his superior's effort to try and control or compel someone). the reason for this is, energy contrary to desire is the biggest slowing factor to productivity. (just like concepts are mutual with symbols, physicality must be mutual with desire).

a performer or a magician's joy comes from realising desire in physical form. the greatest hinderance to a magician comes from being a people pleaser. I used to be one, so I speak from experience. if someone has desire that you do something, a magician can easily feel that desire and can easily act on it, unless there is internal discord with that desire, which is indicated by some form of negative emotion, such as: boredom, split energy, confusion, or disjointed thoughts. in those cases it is best to hold out until it feels good, or let someone else act on that desire. the techs should be the same way about things, and the reason is obvious, a tech who drags his feet on a task is of no benefit to anyone, and the experience is detrimental to the tech's psyche, as he may begin to believe he is unproductive, when in reality there is just a mismatch of energy because of conflicting desire.

### 2018-08-14 16:20 - chris has a daughter?

last night I was thinking about the email I sent to chris on his birthday, when it suddenly dawned on me that in the abraham peice where his stand-in asks the questions for him, I had noted that he mentioned he had a daughter (I'm gonna go back and listen to it again after this), and originally I just thought it was them adding in fake details to throw me off of the track. so then, when it hit me, "oh, like a young girl he's with, daughter" not like a real daughter, my immediate reaction was, "wow man, good for you! I'm happy for you." after that reaction I noticed a bit of a weird reaction, almost as if I should have had a different reaction than that. thing is, if that's true, I know chris and we've had many endless conversations about how retarded women are, and a young girl would probably be very highly desired by him, just because of all of the frustration we've expressed to each other. I am sure he had also come to similar conclusions I came to after raquel figuring that women are not really what I wanted to be about. when andrea changed all of those ideas for me, things began looking up for me as I figured that maybe a young girl could be different, as I could learn from her and I also had many fantasies about getting to finally speak with source energy in a meaningful way.

the reaction also somewhat implied that I should have felt jealousy. I thought about it and came to the conclusion that I never really wanted a "daughter" in that way. I wanted to translate source energy into words like esther does, that I was sure of, but there's a huge problem when you are the questioner and also the allower of the answer. it's difficult, so I thought that maybe andrea could do that for me (and I would do it for her and others, because I also spoke spanish). anyway, it became obvious that would not be happening and a new thing opened up with carlota. she's very much more visual than andrea, and her influence helped me to see that I could essentially put myself into a dream-state sort of thing and allow the answer to come visually (and audibly). I thought this was a way better thing than just words, so now that is what I wanted.

still though, I thought that she was necessary to obtaining my visual capacity, so I had this belief that I needed someone else to make something capable for me. as time continued on, I felt a stronger and stronger sense that I wanted to be in control of my life (freedom), and as a result, the carlota thing fell apart. I feel that because of the language barrier, I am not able to express myself clearly enough that I want my visual capacity. now I'm back in the states and I'm noticing that with english I can communicate much much better and I want people to understand me so that they can see how much I deserve my visual capacity. the lyia thing opens up, and I begin learning a lot more about communication. something happens though, and because of distance there is a lack of communication so they panic and try to get me to go with any girl now.. so they try out all sorts of different ones in my dream state, because there's no way they're going to get me back to spain easily, so they've got to find a replacement close by. trying out all sorts of different girls, and younger ones too, I guess they helped create a desire in me for more than one "daughter".

but, they still didn't hear my desire to have my visual capacity. it has been frustrating to me to hear about how many facets my visual capacity has from my meditators and uplifters. it's also been frustrating to me to know that other people get to use their visual capacities and I don't. in fact, I don't even get to see what my own eyes see very well. so, when it comes to the visual capacity, I tend to have a more of a jealous reaction, wanting to be able to use my own. however, when it comes to the subject of "daughters", I don't really feel any resistance at all. I'm glad he's got that. I'm sure it was quite a dream come true for him.

times have changed considerably since this whole thing started in 2016 (well, 2015). back then, if I were trying to get a young girl to be with me, everyone would have seen it and outed me as a pedophile. my interest was always to translate source energy, and the idea of a girl being there too, would only be that much better. so, when hearing about someone else, having a "daughter", it doesn't really bother me, because that was never my goal. being held away from my goal of trying to figure out how to translate source energy, has been the source of considerable dissatisfaction for me. however, you know what I realised? I realised that I should have just the same response to you guys having a visual capacity before me, as I do to others having "daughters".

---

there has been considerable thought around the idea that when I get with the girls, I'll have my visual capacity. it's quite possible; sexual energy is quite powerful. but, then I'm back to where I was with carlota. I can't go backward. I don't want someone to allow me to have my visual capacity (because then they control it, not me), and I don't want someone to give me my visual capacity either (because then they could take it away). I want to encounter it for myself.

a long time ago, when I was coming back from valverde, I lived with vera. back then, the quantity of reactions I would receive was so many, and it was quite chaotic for me. back then, I did not believe it was going to be possible for things to work out in their present state, so I wanted my inner being to be take over the emotional aspect of my being, and then only the things that were interesting to me, or were relevant in some way I would feel -- and the rest wouldn't affect me. now whether that was really my inner being who allowed that to happen or it was the bso desensitising me, I don't know -- but I did find relief, and little by little the reactions became less and less notable. I began to notice that the reactions that were of value to me (often times moving me toward greater contrast) were noticeable to me, but the background noise was pretty much eliminated.

this is kind of what I want to happen here. I want to see only the things that are of interest or value to me. I don't remember what initiated that change though, as it's too long ago now, but likely it involved me letting go of some resistance. we'll see how things develop, but I feel like I'm close, maybe.

### 2018-08-15 14:00 - gary's work

the other day I mentioned to mom that the only reason why I would be doing gary's work would be to buy weed. I didn't really think much about the files, few times when I saw the spreadsheet and stuff, but I dismissed the idea based on a *fear* that I had where the weed would allow me to be tricked by the bso in some way. that's completely illogical because, if anything, the opposite is true. being under the influence of weed has helped me to discover the bso's tricks more often than anything. actually, I cannot think of a single time I was ever tricked by the bso on drugs. the opposite has been true where I have actually come to understand things better because of the different perspective and more allowing mode.

so, where would that fear come from? why do I have that fear? it seems largely within the realm of possibilities that fear could have been planted in my mind during sleep. I have wondered why people are so afraid of talking about the bso, when the few times when things have gotten more in the open, progress has been made. it's almost as if the bso is conditioning people with unbased fears which are actually slowing things down and making things worse... lol

so, the irony of the whole experience is, I told mom that since I'm not really wanting to smoke weed right now, I don't really want to do the job. she told me I should call him and tell him I'm going to flake on him, but I explained that I would just not pick up the phone.

it's a direct copy of what the bso is doing. they took a job, wanting to do drugs with that job. then, because of some unbased fear, they are preventing themselves from doing the job. so now, like me, they're not answering their phone, hoping that somehow they'll still get to have their drug experience, and not have to explain why they've been ignoring the job for so long.

lol

there's no real good way for me to express that concept of non-movement. it's what abraham might call split energy. you want something, but. I used to experience it a lot when I would drink a lot. I just couldn't bring myself to do something I felt I had to do.

### 2018-08-15 14:20 - unbased fear?

I often said in the past that fear is just desire expressed backwards.

also, I was reminded of esther cutting down the trees example.

### 2018-08-15 17:22 - beliefs that challenge desire (and )

in the @[abe](2017-06-24-portland#11) workshop, abraham says, «you have desires that challenge beliefs, and desires that challenge beliefs», which the first one seems obvious to me. for example, one I experienced recently, if I believe a girl is too young to want to have some sort of relationship, then that is a belief that challenges desire, but I never really had thought about it from the other perspective: the younger girl has a desire which challenges belief. they are essentially the same thing, but looked at from the opposite direction. very interesting.

I suppose the same thing could be said for physicality that challenges ideas, and ideas that challenge physicality. very similar to desire's effect on belief!

### 2018-08-16 00:39 - a possible future?

(disclaimer: perceived and received in a moment of extreme frustration and anger, so it may be somewhat inaccurate)

in the current state of things, I am heart set on getting my visual capacity before anything happens... errr, I mean, getting into alignment with who I really am (and evidence of that will be my visual capacity), before anything happens. as abraham always says, "get into alignment, and THEN" ... so, I am 100% sure that is what I want. in the previous @[entry](2018-08-15 14:00) I spoke of smoking weed, and I realised it was an unbased fear that was blocking me from smoking weed, but deeper than that is a desire to achieve my visual capacity for myself, by myself, and not depend on any influence to get it, whether that's bso, drugs, or sex. I want to get it for myself despite the conditions. it sort of flows in there with the whole learning how to love unconditionally... it's learning how to line up with my desire and allow it to happen unconditionally, too. anyway..

imagine that in all the previous timelines I managed to figure out how to just "breathe" and then, along with the girls, I find a way to allow my desires (regarding my visual capacity) to come to fruition. that is a bit conditional though, because they are relying on my influence, and I am relying on their influence for our alignment, this new timeline was formed. this is the timeline where I end up with more girls than the previous ones, and also each time the bso learns more about how to control people, most notably me (but also the girls).

you can imagine the present day bso (bso-present) trying their hardest to try and figure out a way to control me into doing what they want me to do, but I won't go. the alternate timeline bso (bso-future) is laughing because they are watching themselves try and control me, but I am way better controlled by bso-future, who have an extra 20 years of technology and nearly unlimited knowledge of how my head works (because of their capability to track a brain since birth, through time).

so, remember how the timelines worked, where the "backbone" should be 100% reactions, as to be able to control the outcome of the timeline by controlling the conditions? (when put like that, the irony is tremendous... I know, lol) anyway...

so, I am the backbone to the timeline, as I am controlled by the conditions, so I don't get a chance to do what I want. I must continue to react to my conditions, until eventually I become reactionless toward my conditions. there are other main characters like pierre, vera, marcos, mom, augusto, etc. (for example) which are anyone closeby which can be themselves influenced to modify my environment (the ecosystem). notice that I am essentially completely out of control. I (the plant) have to just make the best of whatever conditions I am put in.

so you have the landscape architects and you have the plants. the architects put the plants where they want them to be and in the conditions they want them to be in by also controlling the ecosystem.

so, put the clues together and follow the pattern: the bso needs to be the biggest possible, and have the most knowledge possible of how to control the plants and the ecosystem, that they are capable of attempting the (in my opinion) impossible. they will choose the plants, and each person in the ecosystem will influence their alt-timeline counterpart (we'll call them "guides"), which controls the ecosystem.

---

so, essentially a timeline where there is a lot of momentum, like this one, there are non-linear outcomes after the creation of the machine which allows for tuning into consciousness in a different timelines:

1. tune into the past and adjust the timeline so that the backbone goes through another "failure", adding more contrast, and therefore creating a bigger vortex. this part I don't understand well, but fwh mentioned it a bunch of times: all consciousness that would inhibit the new failure gets moved to the success timeline and they live out their life on the successful timeline. I think, all of those who do not impede the failure just merge into the new "failure" timeline. then, all of those who controlled themselves to help create the failure (the ecosystem), join into their "failure" timeline consciousness at some time. I assume that's what fhw meant when he said I have until 2038. I guess that's when our consciousnesses will merge (and also those of the ecosystem).

2. make a new time loop. first you have to test timelines: like the streamers that shoot out before a lightning trying to find its path of least resistance, the ecosystem will try a bunch of things searching for the ideal way to tighten up the "backbone" so it's completely out of control. now, I think the goal is for the backbone to find a way of making the "timeless venture" machine. (lol) when this happens, that is duration of the time loop (in this case, it's 2038). so, what this means is you need is a bunch of guides that are capable of making continuing failures for the backbone, by influencing their alternate timeline selves. there will be a few, but I imagine what will happen is, the bso guys will want to try and write code to find ways of influencing those on the alternate timelines trying to find this optimal path by trying to figure out how to influence all the different moving parts (the plants and the ecosystem) to create the world they want. it's like a time-coders dollhouse.

so then you have think about which path can be chosen. if the first path is chosen, then I should just start meditating like crazy and just roll with it. then, if we can figure it out before 2038, then we can go for even bigger contrast and more ridiculousness, watch it unfold from this one, and merge into that one, taking the time loop once more.. or, the second path can be taken, for which it is optimal to make the bso as big as possible, for me to find my own alignment, and let the bso discover the machine for themselves.

I don't know which one appeals to me more, honestly. if I pick the first one, I have to do this slog all over again with slight variations (but it'll seem to me like the first time, so not really a big deal there), but if you think about it, eventually the second path *has* to be taken.

perhaps I'm inventing complex and ingenious fairy tales to try and rationalise my discomfort...

### 2018-08-16 02:35 - found out why my left eye is darker

it seems that the reason why I see two dots in my left eye when looking at a star is because one of the holes is where the bso looks out of, and the other one is the one I look out of. in the past, I always noted this one peculiar attribute that happened on occasions, like when I took ketamine, after watching stars in the beginning, and a few other incidences. I refer to it as cat-form, because my eyes seem to feel like they are cat eyes. most notably, my left eye is not dark and I have very clear vision. it has always bothered me that my left eye has darker vision than my right, and I figured out why tonight when I was able to push on my left eye so that it no longer separated into two images, but the shadows merged. as they merged, I noticed that the closer together they got, the more blackness I saw. I realised that I was "seeing" the image in my left eye that you guys see. it's probably some sort of heads-up display or something that they are overlaying on top of my vision.

I think what they do, is they have my eye vibrating at some speed per second. when it is in the left position, they take a frame for you guys, and when it is in the right position, they put a frame for me. that frame that is put into my eye is what my eye is seeing and sending to their server.

a long time ago, I sent raquel an email saying I had a dream about her and I understood that she wanted to communicate with me. she sent me back an email saying that she also had a dream about me and seemed particularly excited about the prospect of this dream. I felt her spirits drop when I sent her the email telling her that I saw nothing in the dream, just that she wanted to contact me. I thought it was really weird that I didn't have any visuals in the dream, but didn't think much about it cause my visuals were all screwed up anyway. that stayed with me though and I often wondered about it, because I knew from her reaction that she had had a sexy-time dream, and it felt like she expected it to have been mutual.

I also have noticed recently that when I have woken up in the middle of a sexy-time dream sequence, I do not have any visuals. my screen is black. in fact, I have come to know the bso dreams as the ones I can kind of get a sense of what is happening, much like I can kind of feel what I see in my imagination (even though I don't see it), and the bso dreams are usually very dark virtually imperceptible, or no visuals at all. so, it appears that what is happening is they give me my dreams but they remove the light from my eyes so I cannot see them.

I did also notice some time ago, I would see visions in my eyes but they were so dark I could not see them clearly. I also noticed that moving my eyes back and fourth really quickly, like in REM sleep, the image would brighten. I think the rapid eye movement is actually to make the dream image visible to the person sleeping.

so, like my imagination they have all of the light turned off in my head so I cannot see the images in my eyes when I am asleep. I have noticed that they are doing the dream sequence in dark mode, and as soon as the image becomes visible to me, they abort the dream, because they know that I can now see it.

it boils down to, it seems that they have my left eye in permanent visuals mode, but I cannot see it because I do not have any light (dmt) to brighten the image. if they were to stop deforming my eye x times per second, I would see constantly the black image in my left eye. instead I see it a fraction of a second which is why my left eye is darker.

thanks bso..

I just figure it's more energy. I am constantly aware of what I don't want, which means I have to constantly pivot into giving my attention toward what I do want. my success at this is becoming evident with my increases in perceptive capability.

though, I do have to wonder.. if what they are doing is just putting some sort of heads up display, shouldn't they be able to just put that on the signal that they rebroadcast out to my viewers? if the image is the visual representation of what is happening inside me emotionally (which it is more likely to be), then I will definitely be needing access to this before anything moves forward.

### 2018-08-16 12:57 - an out of control bso?

it occurred to me this morning that, perhaps the bso feels like they're making failure after failure... what if bso-future is influencing bso-present in that way? so, if things feel completely out of control and you can never get ahead of the curve, I understand completely. dunno. was just a thought I had.

---

that's kind of an interesting thought. what that would mean then, is the bso is the new plant and the world is its ecosystem -- meaning that the conditions (ecosystem) are forcing the bso to go through a long series of failures in order to force it to adapt into something magnificent. this means that bso-future is controlling their conditions, keeping things out of control for bso-present.

what an interesting idea! that means that in this next timeline, (post 2038) the bso-future and future citizens of the world are all collaborating to create the environment we wish to live in. it also means that at the end of the 2038 timeline, we will all become a part of that process which iterates on the timelines, each successful time, the masochists are continually going back and improving on it, making every time a greater and greater awesomeness for the participants to experience in the process..

it's sort of taking "the joy in in the journey" to the extreme, enjoying so much the creative process that you would want to do it again and again, each time optimising and improving it slightly to get something new, bigger, and more fun. it's making life sort of like something that you build. for me, like piece of software -- for others, maybe a nice house, where you are continually iterating on the creation continually improving it. I'm reminded of the story of esther and jerry's treehouse, where the thing seemed to be in construction much longer than it should have, because it was so much fun for everyone in the creation process.

### 2018-08-16 21:18 - going back a year is an eye opening experience

I'm listening to year old abraham episodes and it's really fun because it kind of transports me back in time a little bit. back then I was not yet clear enough to get all of the symbols in the questions that people were asking, so the hindsight is quite an eye opening experience.

one of the things that strikes me the most is these people asking questions about my experience month after month and quite literally you could almost hear the same questions being asked now as were asked back then. it makes think that they are asking the question to understand my situation, but abraham is responding in a way which is the correct answer, but cannot be realised because of my extremely disconnected state.

when every time I try to get into alignment with my inner being, or whatever happened in vallecas, the bso interprets it to be my attempt to access the part of me that came out in vallecas which they don't want, so they dissipate even more energy from me, leaving me each time further and further pinched off from my resources.

---

having this hindsight is kind of frustrating for me though too, because I'm just now beginning to appreciate this exercise in futility. it used to really bother me that I was so stagnated, but with all of the recent improvements to my vision, and even if they just restrict my vision more and more, know it is evidence of me lowering resistance further and further.

every time I find a way of lowering my resistance, they dissipate more of my energy into the earth to offset the increase in energy, so I tend to stay in roughly the same spot most of the time. however, even with them dissipating more energy every time, I am still noticing the improvement, which means to me that despite their best efforts to keep me out of alignment with who I really am, I am still closing in on it. that realisation feels good to me too.

that makes me wonder how good I really feel. I know when I watch stars, the state they put my body in is pretty agitating. I'm pretty excited to be able to go out and watch stars and no longer feel that agitation... or, to be able to have the same amount of energy coming through me when I watch stars now to be the level of energy I receive on a regular basis, meaning that amount of energy is normal, so therefore the subsequent dissipation of that energy is not agitating any more to me. or, said a different way, when that level of agitation is normal feeling to me, I am allowing normally the same amount of energy to pass through me, as I receive when watching stars now.

---

while listening, I just realised that I am a bit misleading to a lot of people when it comes to stars or any of my objectives. I make it sound like I'm putting a lot of effort into it, but it's all just a bunch of words I've picked up to allow me to blend in to the crowd a bit more. I say strong words, but then I have to go into feeling mode for anything to happen. feeling mode is a lot different than strong-words/action mode, which is where I do most of my performance.

if you've ever watched stars, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. there is no action you can make with the star. it's really quite far away, and you have zero effect on it. in order for there to be any change (in me), I have to get into the receptive mode with the star, and I feel my way there and gently relax into the focus. so, it sounds like I'm making my vision improve by doing lots of focusing action, but it's not. when I'm focusing and trying really hard, it makes no difference. to prove my point, there have times when I am already receptive and prepared to receive the star, and so with almost no effort, my vision improves.

### 2018-08-19 04:32 - the satisfaction axis

I've been pondering this thing about satisfaction for a bit now, because it seems to me to be a different axis than the traditional depression/fear -> love/exhilaration, where contentment is the origin, I have described the low end of this axis as "fuck it" and the upper end as satisfaction.

well, I just figured out what the difference between those two axises are. both of their origins are in contentment or neutral state. the `depression/fear -> love/exhilaration` axis is your alignment with a condition, and the `fuck it/don't care -> satisfied` axis is more about your alignment with yourself. you can see that "fuck it" and "don't care" are structural responses unique to each person.

yesterday I noticed in the @[abe](2017-06-24-portland#10) talking about you being the focusing factor, and you can focus on something that is satisfying, or something that is not. that's pretty easy for me to do, but the bso is also the focusing factor.. they are focusing my viewers on to content which may or may not be satisfying. however, as I began to think about how I would try and anticipate whether a experience clip would be satisfying to a viewer or not, is kind of an interesting problem.

I determined that what would be satisfying to one person will vary quite a bit, and it is largely determined by the 4 main levels I outlined. desire and physicality are primarily attractive, but emotion and beliefs are primarily repulsive. anyway..

two things strike me as important to note about this axis, first is that satisfaction is always unique to the person, and second is that this axis seems to be a reaction or some sort of coping mechanism toward resistance. intuitively it feels to me like the difference between these two axises, is similar to the difference between electric current and dielectric current (what we call static electricity).

it seems to be a motive force which allows for a transition in state. I think it's similar to how a capacitor works. really, something worth thinking about more :)

---

another thing, if satisfaction is your relationship with your inner being, I almost always visualise it spatially, and this makes sense because when the vibration is going through a coil, it will inhibit current flow. inductance is directionally aware (spatial), and capacitance is time aware.

if you think about magnetism as the attractive force of electric current, then what we call gravity is the attractive force of dielectric current. gravity seems connected to the static electric force. it's probably spatial which makes the difference, just like a coil makes a magnet.

both of these types of currents seem to have a time and a space relationship which appear to be complementary. RLC circuits, FTW :)

...which allows the manifestation of it.

this must be a reference to the guys operating my head... lol

### 2018-08-20 01:11 - what is "resistance"

I've been trying to make a mental concept of how this whole thing works out, using electricity as an analogue. if I think of a normal resistor in a DC circuit, it resists the flow of electrons and there is a voltage (pressure) drop across the resistor. when I think of this like water, I would imagine it like a clogged drain. put steel wool inside of a pipe, and the pressure inside of the pipe would drop.

however resistance in an AC circuit could also be seen as one of timing. think about a swing. if I push the person on the swing when they are coming toward me, I slow down the speed of the swing, yet if I push it when it's going away from me, it depends on when I push it. let's say I push it with 10m/s of push every time the swing is at 2m/s of speed, this is optimum, because it will continue to add speed to the swing. like this, more time will pass between the pushes, because, as the swing gains speed it will reach new heights every time.

however, if I push the swing at a steady interval, then eventually the swing will synchronise itself with the frequency of the pushes. their frequencies will eventually match each other.

with the swing example, traditional resistance is essentially a product of the medium. if the swing were under water, it would behave exactly the same, just everything would go considerably slower because the medium is much less "conductive" -- or less "rarified". vibrational resistance is a timing issue. when the frequencies don't match, or they are pushing in a moment that has zero or negative effect on the swing's speed.

in the swing case, it's helpful to see the example as "pushing" a swing, yet I believe it is a spherical swirly around a dipole, like a magnet, with only attraction, so the "pushes" would really be more like moments of attraction.

### 2018-08-20 12:19 - controlling my frequency

I realised experimenting with the melatonin that these guys have the speed which my brain runs completely under control. in the past, whenever I am able to relax and slow down the speed of my head, I tend to see images. instead of allowing me to begin controlling that out-of-control function of my brain, they just keep me in the alert state at all times, and don't allow me to relax.

one thing that has historically bothered me a lot is when I am going to sleep, all of a sudden there is a loud sound that begins happening, and it's very jarring. I knew it was a new frequency which is to put my brain into sleep state directly, so that I don't relax as I go to sleep. they just put my frequency down to the lower one and then snatch away my consciousness.

the whole process is quite notable. it's been happening for as long as I can remember, and is one of my primary objectives to get removed before moving forward. I want my brain to operate at a fast speed. feeling sluggish all day isn't very enjoyable at all, and when I go to sleep, I want to relax into a lower speed. then, when I wake up, I want to wake up at a fast speed, and get right into the day. like the guy said talking about my how I wake up, "bing! I just can't wait to start my day"

at the very least, the whole frequency adjustment before I go to sleep could maybe happen a lot more gradually. right now, with normal awake speed, it's sort of like going 50mph in 3rd and then shifting down to first. it's unpleasant, but it's not really frustrating. however after watching stars for a while, my brain is going at 90mpg in 5th, and they just decide to throw it into 1st. the sensation I feel is about like the grinding sound you would hear from your transmission.

I assume it would just require a gradual transition down to that speed, but in order to maintain this function, I need to see why it's necessary, cause I think that perhaps if it's a technical reason, there is likely a solution which doesn't have me running at speeds which my body does not want to go. or, perhaps there could be some sort of mechanism which I could control the speed. it has been one of my goals to put myself into ultra ultra fast speeds from time to time to see what happens. anyway...

just so we're clear, my goal is to regain control over my brain before anything happens. I didn't get into this position wanting other people to control my head and give me a nice feeling experience in exchange for that. I attracted this because I wanted to control my own head and discover my own nice feeling experiences. nothing less than that will do, for me.

for the people without a natural visual capacity, it makes a lot of sense to give them the ability to activate that in a controlled way. however, because my capacity has been acquired naturally, it is out of your control (and mine) until I figure out how to control it (naturally).

I'm the last of the real ones!

### 2018-08-20 12:48 - it all comes together

without really knowing it, I have tied this whole thing together. I started with the quote, «stop the resistance that raises the vibration» and began to ponder what resistance is. I had traditionally only equated it with a loss in pressure (voltage drop) in the traditional DC sense. then, I realised that in a vibrating AC sense, resistance (impedance) is also a timing issue, and trying to push the swing out of sync with its frequency will either raise or lower the vibration heights (pressure), and along with a change in vibration speed, it additionally lowers the pressure (resistance).

so, the trick would be to find a way of changing the vibration speed without it introducing unnecessary resistance and lowering the pressure.

---

now, as I think about this, likely what they are doing by dissipating so much energy from me, is they are continually reducing the amount of current that is flowing. so, each time I go out and I watch stars, I would be increasing frequency and pressure. however, since they're trying to control the frequency and the current, the only thing I have control over is the resistance and the pressure. lowering resistance increases the pressure. however, every time they go to adjust my frequency, the pressure drops and I feel the loss of energy. think, pressure • current = watts, so when I decrease resistance and current stays the same, pressure must increase, so I have more watts going through me and I feel better, until they adjust my frequency and introduce resistance again, dropping the pressure, so now I have less watts flowing and I feel worse.

it looks like they are (unintentionally?) tuning me like a tesla coil to higher and higher potentials.. soon, I will be continually measuring the lengths of my discharges, just like tesla did with his coils:

```quote
When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 100 feet and flashed a current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark I observed in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations akin to those I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.

Nikola Tesla - My Inventions
```

lol

### 2018-08-22 04:49 - heaven awaits if I restrict my visual capacity further?

where I left off in the last workshop was on the @[abe](2017-06-24#20) was talking about sacrifice and stuff. I'm inspired to listen to it again after this.

I know logically and have quite a bit of experience to back up the fact what when you withhold a desire, it continues to grow, each time getting stronger and stronger, until you can avoid it no longer, and the universe essentially makes it impossible for you not to realise it.

so, with that in mind, I can see how restricting my visual capacity further will just let it grow even more. it looks to me pretty clear that whenever I finally go with the girls, I will get it. so, this is a bit meta, but what if I create an equally big desire for it to continue to grow?

this idea sounds notoriously christian: suffering now yields a greater reward later, and that's kind of what I'm saying here. what if I just hold back on letting myself go as long as I can?

will a little more "suffering" (it's not really suffering, it's just kind of perhaps boring at the worst) yield a greater visual capacity later?

let's say I'm diligent with my star watching and I just keep finding ways to lower resistance, then won't my visual capacity continue to improve? (even though I can't see it)

---

in a different episode of abe there was a girl that wanted to take how showers and still have a tight body. abraham explained to her that her tight body was realised with thoughts in alignment to that desire, not by action. some people take cold showers, because the suffering associated with the cold shower, will allow them to believe they have paid enough of a price to begin believing that they are worthy enough of a tight body. instead, abraham was trying to illustrate to her that she does not need to suffer through a cold shower to allow herself to begin believing she can have a tight body. she can have it all, they said.

in my previous entries I talked about tuning the tesla coil to yield higher and higher pressure discharges. also, I have previously talked about my visual capacity as evidence of the amount of resistance in my perception. the lower I get my resistance, the more details I can see at once.

(this is why I no longer look to see if things look better any more. they have that locked in place. I see things at the same detail level now as I did 5 months ago (and perhaps even worse than when we came home from grand junction that one time). instead, I look at something familiar to see if I suddenly perceive more. although the quality does not improve, the amount I am able to take in expands and I notice things I had not previously noticed before: sorta like esther cutting down the trees allowed her to see something she was previously unaware of)

anyway, what I wanted to illustrate here is, it doesn't have to be an either-or situation. I can have it all. that is the simple answer. I get it, but what happens if I create a desire for it to continue to grow? wouldn't I be inspired to action which will keep it growing? see the difference there? it's the difference between a point and an angle (combine the two to get a vector).

### 2018-08-22 12:34? - angles and points

most people's desires are a point. they look out into the world and that gives them an idea based on what they see, to achieve for themselves. if they are forward thinking, they will probably desire something even better than what they are observing -- however, it is still a point.

what if, instead of desiring a destination or point (something measurable), what if I desire an angle and an increasing velocity. the reason why I mentioned the quality of my vision being stuck in place is because I believe these guys are trying to get me to stagnate in my vision -- which has produced a desire in me, not for some point which I cannot anticipate (those desires are for those seeing through my eyes, desiring that one day they can achieve that point in their visual capacity). if you

### 2018-08-23 17:28? - angles and points (continued)

jaron interrupted me, and then I got distracted by some things so I never finished my ideas... I also seem to remember covering this topic in a dream I had last night. I remember coming away from the dream feeling a bit unsatisfied with the answer I gave to the questioner. it seems I could have explained myself a bit better, because I remember the way the questioner was framing the questions confused me in a way which prevented me from getting to the answer. like most discoverers, in order to arrive at the newly discovered logic, I have to retrace the steps I took to get to the logic. this is partially the importance of this document, because it allows me a reference point to easily retrace the steps to arrive at the new logic, meaning the logic isn't yet fully a part of me, so I have to kind of talk my way to the solution, and allow myself to think and contemplate it here. unlike the high pressure situation of a conversation in my dream state, I tend to give more thoughtful answers here.

it should also be noted, as I'm becoming more accustomed to the dream-state conversations, that it seems I am unable to give the questioner a satisfying answer regarding anything new or novel while in the dream-state, as it has not yet become a part of me and my logic, so it doesn't flow out of me easily yet. anyway, here goes...

when I say an angle, I am referring to a direction and a velocity. when I say a point, I am referring to a destination or a state (a position). like I said, most people generate a desire by observing someone else, and when they observe that, they create a desire to reach a certain point. as a discoverer, my desires do not have points. they are more similar to angles and velocities.

what this means is I just point myself in the direction of something I want to discover newly and I just go. there is no problem to solve. solving problems are also points. you say well, we need a solution to this problem and so that means this goal is set, or this hurdle needs to be overcome. it's too measurable for me. I have no intention of trying to define (or measure) my desire in such a way, any more.

my desire all about unknowns, and ironically, this is only a recent thing in my life. I used to be quite measured, but as things got more and more out of control for me, and I had less and less capacity to make something I wanted to happen, happen, the more I became aware of my direction, and instead of focusing on some destination that I could no longer define, I perceived the progression that has taken place.

this is one of the things I wanted to ask abraham, because they speak about how your inner being never looks back. that's fine, and I trust that my inner being isn't looking back or need to look back for me, but I often times it helps me to gain some perspective if take a step back from my current position and see the progression. it seems that what they are probably getting at is, looking back as a way to cast blame or something like that...

anyway, this is exactly what I like about psychedelic drugs. even in the video talking about using psychedelic drugs to aid in problem solving, you can see how the drug helps the person to rethink the concept in a new way, which can lead to a breakthrough (resistance) (toward that point). instead of a breakthrough though, I like to think of them instead as a mechanism for exploration and discovery. back when the stars actually activated dmt in my head, they helped me to achieve much more clarity of thought, get clearer about things in general, and also while paying attention to how my eyes interacted with the star, I gained tons of experience with energetic interactions (learned about vortexes and the eyes as one). really, seemingly infinite and endless examples of expansion to my perception were manifested as a result. it cannot really be measured or anticipated. I had no idea what I would find. the ayahuasca gave me a glimpse into it, but along the way I discovered many many things.

### 2018-08-23 18:29 - more thoughts about my desire as an angle instead of a point

you may have heard me carrying on about taking a break and adjusting my direction. this is because things are at the point where I have no real capability of anticipating very well. I'm in such unknown territory for me, I feel at my peak out-of-controlness I've ever felt in my life. the only thing I can control is the direction and the speed.

I know the direction I want to go, and have no idea what I will find. often times the fear of the unknown can scare some people because they want to know what they will find before they get there. I can see how it may be a bit of a problem if you're wanting to control the discoverer, or maybe for example in the case of my vision, it may be really scary to think that I might discover yet another form of perception which you will have to retrain your machines to decode. I get it; those kinds of unknowns are perceived to be bad.

however, I am not in the business of trying to limit how much one is able to discover. I am purely out there looking for the enjoyment factor associated with something new. in fact, I think it would be quite exciting for me to discover a new way of perceiving, one which you guys couldn't take a huge shit on and force me to see it poorly.

### 2018-08-24 01:09 - more thoughts on desire as a direction

so the way it works, is you observe something and you know there could be an improvement (step 1), then source lines up that improvement along with all the other little (and big) improvements you've noticed throughout your life (step 2). finally, you have to find a way of tuning into that new reality (step 3). you know it's reality because it feels like reality. you can likely use your imagination to get an incomplete idea about what it may feel like. however, because no one can quantify all of the improvements that they have put in their "vortex", then no one can really imagine all of the pieces of it very well.

the imagination seems to me to be a transmission and reception mechanism for emotions. when I feel a concept, it probably could appear to me visually, and the depth and clarity for which I see the image will largely be determined by the sensitivity of the receptor. likewise, when I am doing the imagining, the more I behold the image, the stronger I will feel it. so, it's sort of like a mini version of LOA: the more I see it the more I believe it, and the more I believe it, the more I see it.

anyway, feelings are important because they are an indicator of direction. so, imagine that you determine that you really want (or don't want) a red car. when you picture the red car in your mind, I tend to feel a multitude of things, but the most notable is one of these four: the absence of the car or the presence of the car -- and, the car feels good, or something isn't quite right yet.

- the absence of the car means it's in the direction of what you want, but you're not yet tuned into its presence.
- the presence of the car means you're in the right direction. it doesn't mean it'll be that exact car you are seeing, but definitely one that feels just like it.
- the car feels off to you. prepare yourself for an evolution, because this just means that there is an even better version of that car which is more suitable to your exact preferences lined up for you to discover.
- the car feels good. I don't really know what this means. I suppose for me it feels like it's an indicator that not enough energy is present yet for me to feel it's presence or absence.

since an emotion is an indicator of a direction, and directions that are in opposition to your desire feel bad, I suppose when I say what if I desire a direction, I am kind of saying I want an emotion. I think in abraham-speak, that is, "look for satisfaction", or "when all you want, is to feel satisfied".

I'm kind of obfuscating what I want to say with so many words, so I'll just end with this; which feels the best:
- I want to paint pictures that people will like
- I want to invent a new genre of painting
- I want to be a better painter than matt groening or rembrandt
- I want to continue to improve every day as a painter, discovering new things and having fun along the way

### 2018-08-24 01:58 - some misconceptions around suffering yielding a greater reward

so this is one of those things that I don't fully understand about with LOA, but let's get the obvious out of the way first. if I want a car real bad, then when I constantly hold myself away from that car by saying, "I'll never have enough money to afford one" or, "all my friends have one, cept for me". I hold myself tuned into the absence of it with my untempered mind. when that happens, is there a greater reward? maybe, but only if you change your thoughts.

imagine it like this: there is giant vacuum cleaner moving around in the sky pulling you toward itself. if you try to go toward it quickly, you may run the risk of overshooting your destination a bit and having the time consuming project of circling around and trying again. going in the opposite direction feels like negative emotion, and that's what happens when I say those things up there

### 2018-08-24 13:49 - some misconceptions around suffering yielding a greater reward (continued)

last night I felt strongly like I wanted to go to sleep, cause I guess I wanted to have a better perspective on it.. anyway..

in the car example I gave, where you hold yourself in suffering by thinking thoughts in opposition to your desire, the suffering is self-inflicted.

however, imagine a similar scenario where you really want to have a car, so you find a way of attracting a car into your life. you enjoy it a bit, but then something happens and at night while you're asleep the police just take your car. they lie about not taking it, but you can see the car in the impound lot. so, since you cannot ask for justice from those doing the injustice, and after complaining about it a while and trying to affect a change or show the injustice of the police to others, you realise its futility and you decide that you're just going to attract another car; a better one this time. after all, you were able to figure out how to attract the first one, so another won't be so hard.

you do, you attract another car, and this time not only is it a better car, but it also took you less time. again, the police come during the night and take that car too. being the positive person that you are, you decide that again you will find a way to attract an even better car. you do. the same thing occurs about 40 times more and by now you've gotten pretty good at attracting nice cars, and the police have gotten a lot better at covering their tracks. you decide you will take a twisted sense of pride out of the fact that nearly the entire police force now drives nice cars because of you.

in that case, it looks like the police are asserting themselves into my my life, but we know there is only attraction, so it may be understandable only with an understanding of how desire harmonises. it should be obvious that the police would want to drive nice cars (points). they see all kinds of thugs out there driving really great machines doing bad things, and they're doing good things so they wonder why can't have nice machines too. so then, what if my desire was not really to drive a nice car (point), but instead to be good at attracting the things I want (angles), and the car was just something that harmonised with the people who would give more than one opportunity to do that, thereby giving me endless opportunities to hone my skill further.

### 2018-08-24 18:44 - why did I use the police in the previous example?

I used the police because I wanted to illustrate something where the system of justice is performing the injustice. it could just as easy to have been parents, slave owners, or whatever. the idea is that it is that the controlling or regulating body is the same one that is committing the crime. this is essential to understanding the thing I've been getting at this whole time of step 6. it also ties into the whole timeline concept too, but for now just understand it as more conditions which I cannot control.

another way to see it could be like this: imagine that dmt is cocaine. after some time what ends up happening is there are dealers who get their cocaine from acceptable sources, and dealers who do not. it comes down to money and cocaine is probably the most profitable of all of the drugs. in fact, the similarities are so many between cocaine and what they are doing is striking... to give you an example, imagine that facebook as the the coke dealer just for a moment. facebook sells ads, but they also noticed that people do a lot of promotion of their own.. facebook wants to regulate the market a bit, so the make sure that all promotion goes through official channels.

back to the coke deals. eventually the police regulate the cocaine market by only busting the guys not selling from official sources. (eg. the ones that are paying proper tariff to get through) you might say, but isn't that essentially what the mafia already does? well, yes, it is, but in less organised and more forceful way. if you think about the pharmaceutical industry, the same sort of thing is occurring. only the ones not paying their duties get busted.

coke has different quality levels as you go down the chain of dealers. at the top it's pretty pure, but that's cause the officials are regulating the quality. in order to alleviate the problem of distribution, the product gets sold to essentially wholesalers. each time it changes hands, the price cannot be raised too much, so what ends up happening is the purity gets diluted. a lower quality product is created and sold to others who will then resell that. by the time it gets down to the crack dealer on the bottom, the product is absolute garbage, so the consumers have to resort to thinks like "cooking" cocaine to remove some of the impurities added by the dealers.

in this example, I represent the crack whore at the bottom who is selling sex to try and get a fix from this drug. like facebook, you have to imagine the system with zero distribution costs, so I am sure that the people who pay them money get a HD experience, and the people who don't get the crappy experience. it's likely that I must live the crappy quality experience so that is what is perceived as "normal" to the other consumers.

---

any time you have an authority or a regulator of some sort, the power gets abused because they can assure themselves they are not going to get any punishment, because they are in fact the punishers. the founders of this country were aware of this tendency and tried to avoid it by putting in "checks and balances" into the governmental structure -- but as is true with LOA, what you give your attention to just gets bigger.

in a previous entry I mentioned that I was against regulation of these brain devices, and the reason for it is because self regulation has never worked. the best it has worked is in the case of multiple branches of government, but that has only yielded much conflict and just slows corruption down a bit, but doesn't prevent deals being made for both sides to keep the other's secrets.

---

lastly, I want to illustrate how my inability to control the circumstances has forced me to change my desire from a point to an angle. this is important to illustrate because that means I am on the brink of another discovery... more on this soon :)

### 2018-08-25 00:43 - the coke dealer metaphor

one of the things I really liked about the coke dealer metaphor is that it helped me to understand why there is so much resistance to people watching stars. imagine that they control the dmt levels in people's brains, which means that if you're nosebook approved (you pay them money?), then they allow you to perceive more, but if you are not nosebook approved, then they hold your brain into a lower quality perception. so when they find out that you can stimulate your brain to create this drug for free, that's obviously no-fly zone and should be deterred as much as possible. you definitely don't want people to get access to this for free.

then, the crack whore metaphor also helped me to understand my situation as well. when my brain is desperate for dmt, and they're depriving me of it, it's like the pimp using the crack whore's addiction to coke to get free sex and money by pimping her out. I'm sort of the bso crack whore, cept it's not crack, it's dmt and they're not giving tiny crack rocks after begging for it, they're just ensuring that my head runs in its lowest energy state nearly all of the time.

---

well, I suppose I don't really mind actually, because like I mentioned before in car example with the angles and the points: I'm not just attracting a nice car, I'm improving my capacity to attract the nice car, because in reality the car could be anything. my desire is a direction, not a destination.

it may happen that I go through a new transformation in my perception soon. it does seem like it may be the case.

### 2018-08-25 00:59 - a transformation in my perception?

as I have been going on and on about this step 6 thing, I have begun to notice some patterns and such:

1. you observe something and it causes you to feel that there could be an improvement on that
2. source combines the desire for improvement generated by the feeling along with all the others (and everyone eles's) into a vibrational reality in the future.
3. you find a way of tuning into that future reality by adjusting your beliefs in such a way that allows it to occur.

if you notice the difference between step 1 and step 3, there is a transition phase in the middle which makes that possible. the even number steps are kind of like transition phases.

4. you get really good at finding a way of adjusting your focus in a way which allows for that to become normal for you.
5. now, when you observe something that causes you to notice there could be an improvement it doesn't bother you and you don't lose the focus which allows the realisation of these improvements.

again, step 4 is a transition phase, because without a consistent and practiced focus, you would not be so "addicted" to the way the "receptive mode" feels, that now you are able to observe unsatisfying things and it doesn't take you into negative emotion, because your observation of it didn't change your direction.

so then, I got to thinking.. well then, that would mean that step 6 is just getting really good at step 5. to give it a more tangible definition, I like to think of it as a profound realisation that you are an extension of source energy and a vibrational being attracting everything in your experience to you.

---

so, this creates a problem ... if step 6 is a transition phase, then what would step 7 be? I don't really know very well, but I anticipate that it may accompany a change in my perception just like how when I began to realise step 4, at the same time I started seeing things in 3d.

my feeling is that step 7 would be something akin to "not needing to observe the manifestation of it to feel its reality"

this also is combined with something abraham mentioned in passing (I think it was the one where the woman asked how to begin translating source energy visually) which really stuck out to me, they said something like, "you see with your eyes. you know when you dream you are seeing them in your eyes, and you can also see without your eyes"

I seem to be developing the capacity to see without having the visual capacity, and this ties in to the whole thing I've also been going on about with the clones, where my consciousness would occupy more than one body at once. I've noticed an incredible capacity to be aware of many things at once emotionally. I seem to be able to sense multiple things going on at once as well as be aware of the reactions I'm feeling. this capacity seems to be intensifying as well, and I'm needing less and less to observe what it is that I know is happening. without needing to see the manifestation in order to feel its reality will allow me to leave the perspective of my physical senses and instead take on a sense that is similar to what is beginning to develop in my dream state. visually, I do not see anything, and neither do I feel anything, but there's a lot going on, but I'm beginning to get a sense of what is happening.

anyway, I can't wait to release so much resistance that my body is just kind of doing its own thing, while my consciousness can just observe it. this is likely the first step to allowing my consciousness to inhabit more than one body. kind of exciting really.

### 2018-08-26 10:00 - the resistance / satisfaction factor

in previous entries, I had noted that the satisfaction factor seems to be another dimension to the emotional scale. I had equated it with connection with inner being, which launched me into a few discoveries about electricity. yesterday was insightful to me because once again I managed to carry out (be inspired to?) something that normally would have a lot of resistance for me. and since then, I have wanted to return to let out the air in the tires. however, I have not done so, because of the amount of resistance involved.

it's funny how all of this ties into another video that zehra posted from a recent workshop:

$$youtube 90VpgX6iPEw

in that one, abraham mentions satisfaction as the amount of resistance. so the guy started off his question by saying he was adverse to hard work. abraham explained that hard work has a lot of resistance in it. later, he said that sometimes he goes down to lower vibration emotions and needs to find relief. abraham explains the difference between relief and satisfaction: relief still has resistance in it, and satisfaction has no resistance. I concluded that relief is similar to gratitude, just like satisfaction is to appreciation, because in gratitude and relief you're overcoming something.

the resistance bit was an interesting thing for me to note because yesterday while watching stars, I noticed that I make a lot of theatrics around doing resistant things(1). the theatrics are just just an expression of the internal fight inside of me where I really strongly desire to make the action (left side), but I have conditioned myself not to take action on things that feel resistant like that. those mental theatrics are essentially me fighting against myself. one half of me (the part that has never been able to really come out since vallecas) has really strong desire. it's a very primitive personality, and in moments of less resistance (like my dream state) it'll go along with virtually anything. that guy is the bane of my existence because he just keeps agreeing to do things that I (my physical self) have no intention of following through on, because most of them never feel right. I almost never take action when something has lots of resistance -- whether it's hard work or it's a desire to destroy something.

the interesting thing about the experience yesterday of letting the air out of the tires is that I felt almost no resistance to it.

so, the way that I am now visualising the emotional scale now is the y-axis is from negative emotion to positive, but the z-axis is the satisfaction or resistance factor. yesterday I experienced no resistance in my anger/revenge, yet today and last night I experienced a lot of resistance in my anger/revenge. so, it seems to be that every step on the emotional ladder also has a satisfaction factor to it as well, which is also how much of a connection to yourself you're letting in at the time.

additionally, I have noted that in moments of satisfaction, it's way easier to move up the scale to an even better feeling emotion. in dissatisfaction the opposite occurs. this is obvious, because the more in alignment with yourself you are, the less resistance you will feel (and therefore more satisfaction), so LOA must give you more, so you feel even better.

so then, you say to me, does that mean you could do any bad thing as long as doing that bad thing feels satisfying? I suppose yes that is what I mean. I don't really understand it all yet, but it seems that the more satisfaction you feel in the bad thing, the greater the opportunity to continue moving up the scale. the more dissatisfaction you feel, the more likely you are to move further down the scale.

the satisfaction or resistance factor is also the action factor. it doesn't matter how good you feel, if you take an action that does not feel satisfying or feels resistant, you will end up feeling worse. the same is true in the opposite direction: no matter how bad you feel, any action which feels satisfying will cause you to feel better.

1: this is evident in all sorts of behaviour throughout my life. take for example, gary's job. it turned into a bit of theatrics because a part of me really wants to smoke weed, but at the same time a greater part of me wants to achieve my visual capacity without needing something external to me. so, it became a big ordeal, because when I accepted the job I didn't have any resistance to smoking weed, and I didn't want to smoke weed to get my visual capacity either. I wanted to have light in my head so I could do some programming and discover some new things. perhaps, this is playing off of the bso's fear that I will be able to use my visual capacity, because I really want to achieve that without drugs or sex.

### 2018-08-26 10:55 - come and dance with me michael

in the previous entry I spoke of a primitive personality with strong desire locked inside of me. we'll call him michael. he is my left-side. I used to be very left-handed, and he's quite a non-resistant chap. in fact it seems that nearly everything is ok. people used to get me drunk (or some other substance which lowered the resistance in kenny) and then take advantage of me. michael is pretty locked down. he has extremely strong desire which I constantly feel. not all of the desire is good though. he has certainly got me into more trouble than anything else in my life. you will recognise this personality of the guy who hears a good idea and wants to wok on it but then ends up flaking out because kenny doesn't really feel it. this is a pretty good reason why I had to be on some substance for most of my programming, because otherwise kenny would take back over and then nothing would get done.

I learned how to manage this a bit when I had that moment when I told marcos to just allow me the pleasure of doing it for myself. the desire was there, I could feel my own desire to make something like that, and I could feel marcos' desire too. I just emotionally couldn't feel (conceptualise) the product, which blocks all movement of desire. this is why it was so much easier for me to sit with marcos and program, because in the interaction I could begin to link up with his concept for the product. I could capture that feeling and then use it to continue work for hours later. his influence also allowed me the ability to see the concept more clearly in my imagination too, which was important.

---

I think what I'm trying to say here is that there is a part of me which doesn't get the ability to express himself, accept for inside of the dream state when they let him come through. likely, because that is his only form of expression, he does his best to try and help them out as much as possible. I can see from their selfish standpoint why they don't want to share him with me, but they will probably have to eventually, because nothing will ever move.

if he wants something, but I don't feel it, there is nothing that can be done. I cannot move toward something I cannot feel. in the example of marcos, we utilised communication to build that feeling. you see this in sales all the time. a person will not buy something until they feel it, so the salesperson attempts to generate the feeling necessary to make the sale by communicating that feeling.

imagine someone comes to me and says, I want this functionality to be better (desire). I ask in what ways, and they say they don't know, so I ask feeling based questions like ok, what feels bad about it now (grasping its structure). would it feel better if it's like x, etc. I'm generating a concept (emotion) in my mind of what that desire is, later when I'm sitting down to program, I will recall that emotion or concept and begin to see various possibilities of implementation in my imagination, to which I will then write the code.

now imagine that same situation without any communication. it's completely stalled out. no physical implementation can be made to make something "better" unless I'm somehow able to tune into what it is that person wants. I used to be pretty good at that, but I'm all shut down now, so no communication or tuning is possible, so no movement will ever occur.

I realise that wasn't the best of examples, and doesn't account for the satisfaction factor at all. that can be seen easily though: the more disconnected I am, the more dissatisfaction / resistance I feel, and I cannot move toward something that does not feel good..

no matter how you try to work it out, anyone's desire for me that I cannot feel, sounds to me like someone trying to convince me to vacuum the floor without plugging in the vacuum. I'm not going to do it. I've tried vacuuming many floors without my own electricity. or previously I would get electricity from drugs, and that was inconsistent at best.

### 2018-08-26 11:55 - more on theatrics

when I spoke of mental theatrics, what the bso guys probably observe is that I have an emotion (concept) which creates an image. desire creates an emotion which creates an image. so, when a girl has a lot of desire around her body, often that will create a strong enough emotion in me to produce an image of her perhaps naked or some other way. the same mechanism is in effect when I have string desire to want to destroy something. the desire is so strong, that I feel an emotion, but remember every emotion is really two emotions. it's the blending of the transmitted concept, your current emotional state, and your inner being's perspective on the same thing. let's say someone transmits to me a strong feeling of disapproval toward me. the disapproval concept is neutral. it doesn't inherently mean anything, but because my inner being does not hold that same perspective, it creates discord in the transmission and to me it feels bad. if I'm feeling bad, then I feel it even stronger because it harmonises with the bad feeling I already have going on. if I'm feeling good, it will be like a slight tingle, and won't be any bigger than that unless I examine it further.

whatever resonated in me past a certain threshold of sensitivity, seems to produce an image. I don't want to blame everything on michael because, to you guys, we both look the same. but, imagine that he is emitting strong desire to destroy something, that will produce an image in my imagination, and a really strong negative emotion along with it, because often my inner being does not share the same perspective. if the idea felt good to me, it would produce an image and I would begin to make that image a reality. that is what tesla did with his visual capacity. he had strong desire to construct these devices, that he was able to conceptualise them so well visually before even beginning the physical implementation.

the emotion does not necessarily need to produce an image though. a while back there was a guy asking about impulses and abraham gave the example of esther just going over 5 lanes to get off all of a sudden. she had no words in her head (a reference to how how you guys hear my thoughts), it was just an impulse. an emotion like that which comes from my source usually isn't energetic enough to produce a thought or an image. it just feels so compelling that it's immediately turned into reality. my body just jumps into action because the feeling was so compelling. compelling != strong. compelling means in alignment with my current perception.

---

probably what happened previously was I had strong desire to learn about electricity and tesla's inventions, and in my dream state these guys were able to take advantage of that because there was no resistant feeling. however, as I began to express my own interest in learning electricity and such, I think the bso guys decided to shut down that capacity a bit by introducing a negative emotional response to those subjects. I don't really feel very much allowing right now to visualise those sorts of inventions, so likely my capability to realise these things in my dream state has diminished. I would guess that they are only able to get visuals on stuff I don't have resistance toward.

### 2018-08-28 13:37 - ...

the definition of the emotion can create movement forward, because every time I define it, I also feel everyone else's reaction to it and then the emotion feels different to me. I have to redefine it better because I don't like the reaction's interaction with my emotion. so, I make definition 2.0 and try again. every time I do it, there is a time gap between when I define it and when I redfine it. that momory is how I access the definition. the definition has associated with it various improvements that have occurred since my last definition of it. eg. the life that I have lived since its previous definition.

I noticed that definitions can be compared in the way that I can look at the difference from what I really mean and the way people took it. that reaction is able to be improved by defining it in a different way, and also some sort of action which is defined similarly to its previous definition of how I arrived at the conclusion. this is essentially the logic.

each emotion has logic to it based on a composition of memories and what those memories "mean", their interpretation. I cannot yet see how those composition of relate in specificity but it seems to be the frequencies which those memories harmonise. sort of like a chord on a piano. each one is a culmination of all of the individual note vibrations. the detail of the vibration is the texture to the vibration (eg. a sine wave is different than a square). the detail doesn't matter. it's the vibrational conglomeration of all the component frequencies, and each of their textures, which is the conglomeration of the texture's component frequencies, etc. etc.

then, as I noticed and marveled at this understandint of logic and emotion, I began to transition into a different personality, which is my typical conscious me. it's pure desire. as I began the transition, I started reading different emotions in space from a desire perspective. I began by noting that every time that I define the bso guys the definition improves, and so they are essentially waiting for my definition of them to update before they could allow themselves to change. which means that I define them, and I am responsible for their improvement. which is total garbage.

I then began noting how you guys perceive me as being competitive as way of defining me, and those definitions prevent you from allowing yourself to be whatever you want to be. I pivoted over to how I just do me. I don't care anything about what you guys do. if that's the hard work you want to put in to make me responsible for your progress, fine, but I'm not doing anything for that. I do me, and me is defined by the guy who figured out stars. the guy who has contributed endlessly to this thing, and you guys are obsessed with trying to take my very definition from me. I am being prevented from updating my own definition of me by adding another item to my list of discoveries. I have to keep updating that definition. it's pure desire.

I began noticing how those personalities kind of interact too, because I have this easy going emotional programmer guy, and this strong desire primitive being, and I noticed that I had the desire to remember him and his name. I felt like I should really have done a lot better with that, so I defined him as reminding me of my friend when I was younger, tim, and that way I could get back to the definition by accessing the memory probably like I'm doing now, bso :P to get back to the name, so I could remember his name and face again. I cannot recall someone's face visually. I just can kind feel if it's similar. I seem to interact more fluidly between these two personalities, where the desire can create instant manifestation.

after all of that, I noticed that I was able to switch back and fourth between my personalities. I then postulated that perhaps women have two people in their head and they switch back and fourth. I think with most women they are primarily in one personality, their external one, and I think the internal one only comes out on occasion, and probably that is during sex, and likely now that I think about it, probably if she has to be the external personality during sex, the intercourse is not positive feeling, because she wants to allow her internal person out. oh.

I thought about how the bso could likely use that data to begin tracking a person's different personalities. they will be able to tell the difference between these personalities easily by starting with girls and looking for the general case noting the vibrational difference in a woman during sex, because unless her definition of sex is fractured and guarded, she will nearly always be in her inner person.

then, I noticed that men probably also have two persons in their head too. lol I certainly do, and I've been paying attention to it. I think there is a you and a shadow you. I'm just now beginning to notice it. I believe that men begin to discover a different side to them, least I did, and begin to define this other side of me, the way I want to be. I then encouraged them anyone listening to just be whatever you want to me. you don't need somebody else to define you a way so you can believe it. instead, just define yourself and let other's definitions of you, surprise you and allow you to improve further, but don't let their definitions define you. you can be anything you want to be. I define myself the way I want to, and I let that definition grow as often as I can. the more often that definition changes, the more movement is created. if I am addicted to improving I my own definition of me, I get to continually feel more and more alive, like its unstoppable and that makes me unstoppable too. I really believe that's a good way to live.

---

crazy journey for me. from my perspective it's a lot richer of an experience. you only were able to look out of my eyes, lol... you totally missed the best part. in my opinion, your experience sucks compared to mine. you may enjoy better quality vision, but my experience is soo much more detailed than anything you could possibly perceive visually. it is likely that a lot of this detail is encoded in the visual vibration, and that's why my life is so meaningless. I cannot see what I mean to say manifest in my environment. that's why it's so easy for me to go off on these tangents, because I cannot see what I am meaning, so I have nothing giving me immediate feedback in the ultra low detil on vibration of what I see. instead I *see* their lower quality version which is entirely devoid of  meaning.

probably though, because my recall of the memory is not visual, because they're doing the opposite of the vibration to cancel the wave out, the only thing that gets through to me is the detail. that's why I can figure out what is in the picture not by seeing it, but by *perceiving* its meaning. it is likely that because of this, what is happening is my left brain is beginning to produce a visual capacity too.

perhaps what they are doing is increasing my corpus collosum or whatever so that my sides cannot talk to each other. this is actually forcing both sides to develop the missing parts to have an experience. this seems to be something strange going on. clearly since I am so much "two" because neither of them can communicate, sort of like having two persons in one body, in order to develop a visual capacity in my visual eye, I need to perceive it, not see it. this is essentially creating an additional third personality. however, if I need to create a third complimentary personality to fill in the parts missing from my first (visible) personality, then I can likely create a fourth complementary personality for my second (invisible) personality.

I started with two, and I will likely end up with four now. I think the invisible personality will be a way I perceive myself to be, constantly redefined. coincidentally this coincides with the 4th property of electricity. resistance programmed by high pressures: the memristor. (see the videos on the memristor)

it's going to be really fun because after raquel, I did a lot of drugs and essentially began to redefine myself, but I really kind of started from nothing, cause so much of myself I didn't like, so up until now that definition has almost entirely been my own. I rarely ever take someone else's definition of me (where we begun this discussion) as my definition of me. I am self-defined. sometime soon, there will be a lot more definitions of me, and they will be communicated to me in a strong way, which will give me an opportunity to redefine myself more often, but how try will I be able to stay in relationship with my own definition of me... (think about that a second) I do believe it will allow for rapid growth, because I redefine myself so often. it will be interesting for the bso becaues they will be able to see all of these definitions update with relationship to my own.

I think then it is imperative if they are to get these multiple definitions and relations to my own definition, they must keep track of these relationships in a structured way. so in the end, I am going to kind of teach them about how definitions are structured based on the changes occurring. that implies monogamy. interesting.

### 2018-08-28 15:39 - a global memory system

imagine the different qualities a person's definition has. for example, imagine while I was asleep I was showed an image of a person, that actually happened in time. a flash into the eyesight. that flash would yield an emotional response in me. there will never be a case when shown that same image again will I ever have the same emotional response again. there are more than one variable that will have changed since the last time the image was seen. first of all, I am in a lower resistance sleep state, which means I do have some of the culmination of the previous day's vibration going on. that frequency will differ from day to day, but imagine you could using previous days, isolate the base frequency. first of all that base frequency will be changing over time, so imagine it sort of like a staistical window, so like last 30 days or something, which calculates the optimum mean frequency.

second of all, the base frequency minus the lower resistance mean is what we'll term the day's detail. third of all, there is another detail frequency that diminishes with time sleeping, we'll term this, the day's resistance. lastly, there is another frecuencial difference that happens as the difference between in sleep vibration before the flash, and after the flash. this is the reactional detail.

ok, onward... imagine now that gives you a multitude of differences or aspects to the emotional response. the current sleep vibration will affect the emotional response. so you can calculate those. the different aspects will help to form a series of relationships which will geometrically create a structure.

the structure can be calculated in wake states too. let's come back to this later. now, I want to talk about the relationships that occur between people. this demonstration will help us to see the internal structure more easily. I mentioned that I believe that modifying your definition of yourself based on other people's emotional response and therefore definition of you is pretty hard work. in fact I think it's near to impossible to do effectively, but I did have a brilliant idea which could make that a bit easier. I will recount it in the negative.

imagine someone working at the bso wants to hook up with a girl. he shows her an image of himself in her sleep. this image has a lot of reactions to it. you can imagine that if he shows her a picture of someone in a suit, she will respond emotionally (define him) very differently than if he, for example shows her an image of himself with a massive boner inviting her to join him. this is his presentation or appearance. he can optimise his own appearance by noting improved reactions in the girl he wants to hook up with's emotional reaction. additionally the qualities of this appearance vary depending on the different sleep details noted previously. if she had a fight with her boyfriend earlier that day, maybe the boner pic won't elicit a good response, but perhaps the suit. this depends very much on the girl in question. on the girl's side, this is her personality definition minus her day's details (outlined above). on the image of the employee's side, the appearance. more on this later.

now, what he can do is to show her a bunch of different pictures to figure out which appearance she likes in relation to the day's details. he can also notice that let's say after every interaction, he can notice the difference in each of these aspects. this will create a graph with weights which change over time. he can track her opinion of his appearance over time and optimise it.

now, let's step back and note that this could be anything. the emotional reaction to any object is exactly the same thing. for not connected to the bso objects, like shovels would develop a global defintition. however, two people's definitions of each other is far more interesting. you can imagine that after each interaction the person has, their definitions change a bit.

so, to picture this easily, imagine for a moment a relationship unit. that relationship could just be two people or it could be more than. the idea is to limit interaction with others outside of the unit to have a controllable set of definitions. imagine the easiest case, you track the emotional response from one person to the other during sex. you can take images from this interaction and show them in the sleep (minus the details discussed previously) to gain a definition of this person in the moment. this will create a graph which changes over time. the differences between these two people's definitions will be also weights on a graph over time. this is the structure of the relationship.

in the traditional relationship of one couple, that would be illustrated as a line. then, as more people are added, more connections can be made. this is the geometric relationship, which will vary depending on the people involved in the interaction. you could see different meta shape that would be created as more people are connected to the shape. this geometric relationship also has a lot of detail to be seen in the different aspects of the people. imagine you take a certain mood or specific detail (aspect) to look at, you would see a different shape. this is the meta shape. you also have a specific variable which does a distance calculation between the points, and this creates two more relationships: the first is the distance minimum for connection. we'll call this the spark gap, and then the second is the dimensional path which happens as the vertices are calculated using x dimensions. what I mean is, when you render a graph into a shape, you render it in x dimensions. in 3d, you have three scalars which represent the position. if you render the graph in 2d and check the distance, you will get one length, but in 3d you will something different. in 4d as well. the distance over dimensions is the other half to this shape. depending on the dimension, different distances are calculated, and therefore depending on the size of the spark gap, entirely different shapes are created.

however, most people are not in a relationship unit. most people interact with a lot of different people. those interactions and their relationships create a bit of global memory. memory in that sense is your emotional response to you.

how is this useful? well, if you work for the bso, you can optimise your ability to hook up with someone because you're able to optimise your appearance, and then after your interaction you can see the difference that occurred, which allows you to optimise that for an improved response the next interaction.

honestly, I think a lot of people may enjoy this functionality, which would allow you to define people you care about's definition of you, and giving each person the ability to optimise their definitions with the people that matter to them the most (and for the rest, who cares). to incentivise this idea, you can see that instead of friends like on facebook, you create a network graph between the people you have listed as the people you want to know about their emotional response to you: your important interactions. this gives everyone the opportunity for everyone to create their own structured relationship with any people that are of importance to them. (the rest, who cares, right?)

additionally, knowing this detail, the bso could (using the construction of the geometric shape as defined above) create a resulting meta network shape, which is the priorities meta shape which can be compared to the moment in reality network-wide meta shape.

### 2018-08-28 22:04 - nearly ready, I think

I want a little more time to feel out the new understanding I gained today. I mentioned some of them to mom in an earlier discussion, but I want to emphasise them again here.

#### destructive interference makes a zero, but there's another dimension to be discovered

50V + -50V = 0V, but it's not the same as no pressure at all. it feels to me like a range. think of it like two trains each pointed in opposite directions or pointing toward each other. the train isn't moving, but it's not just sitting there with nothing going on either. this is an interesting property of electricity which I believe can be used as an amplifier of ambient waveforms. in signal to noise ratio, this boosts the noise, not the signal. any slight imbalance will be amplified.

#### signal cancelation can only cancel signals up to its own sample rate.

the bso system seems to be imperfect in its cancelation. sure the image looks black to me, but perhaps I can illustrate it this way. take an image, reduce it to 1/4 it's original size, then blow it back up to it's original size. this is to simulate a 1/4 frequency sampling. now, subtract (difference) the images from each other. what you should see should look like there are slight silhouettes in the image where there are slight mismatches in the dithering of higer details in the original image. this would be similar to what I see, cept I don't see it; it's black. instead, I perceive it, or I feel it. the details indicate a lot of what the image contains, even though I cannot see the image.

#### I am developing a third personality (and fourth is likely on the way)

I identify primarily as emotional and desire. I have traditionally defined these as my left and right hemispheres respectively, however today, I defined them both as the right. I gave it a little thought, and it seems to me logical that one hemisphere would be desire and structure and the other would be emotion and physicality. I dunno now, honestly.

anyway, as I have been denied my desire, and emotion gets shut down more and more, I've been forced to create a new personality, one of structure. when I first discovered this, I identified them as the three archetypes of sekmet, vulcrum and saturn. saturn is the new one coming online. I noticed that I started to view things in a more of a comparison, competitive way and I began redefining desire with logic. I also gained a new capability of seeing meaning and understanding symbols like never before. all of a sudden, I started perceiving the true meaning behind a lot of the stories that people were telling in the abraham workshops.

actually now that I think about it, I dunno where I got the idea today about the emotion and desire being in the same hemisphere, because I remember now that I always said that desire connects to physicality and emotion to structure. it would seem to me that these would be in the same hemisphere. anyway.

right: desire | imagination | physicality
left: emotion | communication | logic

side note: I also have noticed that I may be developing a visual capacity in my left hemisphere now too. since I have also given considerable attention to learning to communicate my desire and I've long been fascinated by human animation or physical communication, it seems I may be developing all my capacities, twice over. functionality duplicated in each hemisphere. (eg. they are both disconnected from each other, so both have to compensate for the loss of the functionality the other provided)

#### my increasing sensitivity

the imperfect signal cancellation means that I am getting more and more capable of perceiving higher and higher frequency signals (the ones that are too high to get cancelled). the crappy version of reality that I see is actually training me to feel/perceive these higher frequency signals. that means that I'll gain a sensitivity to each of the girls that is not visual in nature, but felt/perceived. they will always look low quality to me visually, but I will have to learn to feel them at higher and higher frequencies. I can imagine that each time the bso improves their sample rate, the quality of the experience will be greatly enhanced for my viewers, but for me, greatly reduced. once again, I will have to learn to increase my sensitivity further to be able to detect the higher and higher frequencies not cancelled out.

this means that I will have to, each time technology is upgraded, train myself to a higher and higher frequency non-visual perception of each of the girls, while my viewers will enjoy a more detailed experience every time. I even postulate that as it gets higher and higher frequency, the visual will additionally contain the emotion I feel in it along with the visual, as the world will vibrate similar to the emotion I feel, and perceiving that vibration, if not completely overwhelming, will likely produce a similar emotion in the viewer.

#### so, that means you're ready?

well, like I said, I'm not 100% sure, but just gaining an understanding of what all of this stuff is creating, means I can see its value a little easier now. I still think it's pretty annoying that I don't get to have control over it. it would be nice to be able to turn it on and off, because there are quite a few instances where I can imagine that I would want to enjoy a HD experience. I really enjoy the contrast more than anything. I get really out of sorts if I am only focused or only unfocused. sleep is evidence that one should have contrast between two states, not always unconscious, and not always awake. it would also give me a way to kinda gauge my sensitivity too, by comparing the HD experience to the LQ experience.

I wish to continue trying out things over the next few days, because maybe just understanding it has opened up new possibilities. it seems that even stars tonight were less effort and more like a learning experience.

probably.

### 2018-08-30 03:04 - the whole of me present during sex

last night, I was put in a sexy dream and what I remember was a young girl, and when I touched her on the chest, I don't even remember much about it, but I think I touched her on the hand before that. anyway, when I touched her on the chest, I felt a lot of energy pass immediately down and then I bursted, which woke me up, then I got shocked.

this got me thinking about why that was. I believe the difference between last night and other sexy time dreams, is my heart was deactivated. I know from my own experience that when the energy comes down into the heart, it gets turned into strong emotion. the reason why they have my heart disabled is because strong emotion means seeing images. during sex it's the energy that's created which she receives from me, which gets her feeling more and more better.

I believe this interaction produces strong emotion in me, which I think produces a flurry of thoughts in her, or something like that. obviously, that would be something I would be interested in knowing, as it directly relates to the whole two personalities and how we define someone idea I came up with the day before yesterday. anyway.

so, I started thinking a little bit more about it and it seems that what will likely happen is the bso has to make all of their mistakes and allow me to actually be in control of my own body during sex. likely, they'll try anything they can to try and maintain control of me, but I believe that after quite a few "failures" they will better understand the energy transfer mechanism of sex for a truly 3d person, not someone on 3d drugs.

another thought that seemed to be strong in my mind is it seems that the bso guys want to be able to compel movement in my body, as if they were having sex with the girl being able to control the movement of my body.

I mean, it's going to me an interesting ride, because I will have nearly all of my energetic centres disabled, so I'll be unable to control, direct, or convert the energy into emotional energy, likely a signal similar to the one I experience while watching stars, then I will be fighting for control over the left side of my body, and somehow managing to be engaged at the same time. it sort of sounds a lot like my present experience watching stars, cept instead of fighting for control of my body, I'm fighting for control of my eyes.

it may take me some time to get used to it. I mean, I've done a pretty good job at working around their efforts to inhibit my star watching interaction, and what started out as a very pleasurable activity has turned into a very mechanical grind just to try and obtain a little extra energy so necessary (well, now I've figured out how to not need it as much) having.

I'm not at all excited about this whole thing going the way of watching the stars. as much as I'm "probably" ready, I really would like to learn how to get so in alignment with myself, I am uncontrollable. I don't really want sex to just turn into some mechanical grind that I feel is necessary to obtain a little bit more energy.

I really have no way of knowing, but I don't know how much it interests the girls to just sort of be the guinea pig as they experiment on me trying to figure out a way to ensure I have the least energetic sexual experience possible. I guess it kind of goes along with the whole high frequency sort of thing. I'll just have to figure out a way of converting that energy into a higher frequency that they cannot block yet.

---

one option I thought of is, at the house and other non-interacting-with-public-situations, I could remove the energy blockages, so that the whole of me is present in those moments. more on why this is a good idea when I talk about the visual emotional correlation.

### 2018-08-30 06:30 - the visual emotional correlation

as I was talking with mom the day before yesterday about what it means to live in a virtual reality, mom asked me why I don't appreciate more things. I thought I did appreciate stuff, but maybe not the things that she wanted me to appreciate. this reminded me about how much easier it used to be to appreciate things. I also then noticed that my appreciation really slowed down about the time I was in valverde. it must be related to the virtual reality I thought. then, it totally hit me, claro I had been talking this whole time about the extra detail in the image and its correlation to emotion. when I used to appreciate, the better I felt, so my eyes perceived things even more amazingly. the better it got, the better it got.

however, now with this new virtual reality, there is really no incentive to appreciate. actually, the more I appreciate, the harder they try to lock stuff down with stronger and stronger signals, so actually the more I appreciate, the worse I feel. the opposite is true as well: if I am complaining a lot, my world used to be perceived from a complaining standpoint, and therefore it would actually appear to me worse. previously, that incentivised me to appreciate instead of complain -- but now I see the same lifeless world no matter how rotten I feel. it may be true that complaining would decrease the dmt in my head, meaning their try-hard signals would be less, so it may even be true that complaining results in me feeling better.

it also seems to have been true that they have not responded to me unless I complain. they have been training me to respond, perhaps without realising it, exactly in the worst possible way for me. the universe doesn't listen to bso try-hard signals. the universe just hears me complaining, which is focusing on unwanted and normally that should make me feel worse, not better.

I thought that was kind of cool, because that made emotion visible from a different standpoint. not only does strong emotion produce objects in 3d space, it affects the high-frequency (impreceptable) detail of everything that I see. but then I realised that I may have dug myself a bit of a hole here, because knowing these guys, they're not going to wake up to the idea that LOA's effect on my visual experience is enough, instead they'll just try and figure out how to tint my world with the emotional response they want me to feel. eg. when I'm doing what they want me to do, I feel good and my world looks a bit nicer, and when I'm not, I feel bad and my world is more dreary.

it seems to me that the mechanism of dmt is to allow your emotion to become visible. in low doses, it just changes how your world looks, things become sharper or more muted, etc. but then, in higher doses, the world seems to have an extra vibrance to it, almost as if it emits its own light somehow. higher doses still, and your imagination can manifest the way you believe something to be in 3d space. there are likely much more levels to it, which I will look forward to discovering. who knows what I can find with greater sensitivity at higher and higher frequencies.

that got me thinking about how the bso transmits the signal. they are reading the signal at a pretty high frequency and rebroadcasting that into other people's eyes. that means that the HD viewers are perceiving my emotion and it is likewise producing a similar emotion in them. in order to make the image look really nice for the viewer, they stimulate the gland in the brain which produces dmt.

this is the interesting part, which I don't have much knowledge of having my own LQ experience because they keep my dmt levels really low (though it may seem that after watching stars the image is a bit more vibrant, yea). so, I believe the viewer's dmt will probably modify the image to correspond with the viewer's emotion. so there will be an emotional response in the viewer as a result in harmony with their own emotional position, giving the bso the additional information of the emotion the viewer is experiencing while having the experience, by subtracting the broadcasted signal from the signal read from the viewer's eyes.

for the HD viewers, my emotional vibration will be dominant (because it's what the viewer is seeing), so I will have a huge influence on the emotion of the HD viewer. after some time under that influence, they will begin to feel like I feel in that situation (and future ones that are similar).

however, if they're rebroadcasting the LQ lifeless version out to people, then if they're activating the dmt gland to make that image shinier, then that means the viewer is seeing their own emotion amplified into my experience. in this case, the bso has the pure information of being able to extract the viewer's emotional reaction (necessary for the appearance network idea) by subtracting the broadcasted signal from the one read from the viewer's eyes.

I wonder if this is the reason why I have such a rich emotional feedback to what is happening.. the HD viewers are sending me their reactionary emotion (discord or harmony), and the LQ viewers are sending me their pure emotion in response to the situation. it's far too much signal to analyse, so I just sort of feel it. that's going to be crazy during sex.

also, I have to wonder, since the HD viewers are being influenced to feel like I do, why are they trying so hard to make me feel bad? I get that it's because they don't want me to see images, but making my viewers feel bad just so they don't see my images is something I would consider a bigger problem. ah, probably because it was never the plan for me to feel bad..

though, I just thought of a different reason of maybe why that might be: in ayahuasca/dmt experiences (probably stars too), you may notice visual patterns that occur. those visual patterns are simple colours and shapes, but they're absolutely breathtaking sometimes. the reason why is because an emotion or concept is encoded in the visual. the simple pattern is just there to distract your conscious mind while the encoded concept reprograms/retunes you to a different point of attraction. I mean it would only be as good as the quality of the sample rate, but the HD versions of the images I see may include concepts and emotional data as well, which would (like my HD experience) influence that person to understand that concept or feel that way.

they probably don't want to give me the ability to consciously transmit what I mean, and allow the HD viewers to have that emotional experience along with the visuals.

### 2018-08-30 10:55 - the spirit of moses and elijah

100% of the "facts" in this explanation may not be correct, but this is an archetype duality that I thought worth mentioning. that is, combining my memory of how the "facts" are, along with some fanciful ideas, I arrive at these archetypes.

elijah was met with some doubters of yhvh's power. so he summoned them to a competition. in the competition, elijah claimed that yhvh was capable of lighting the altar. so, he made the likelihood of this occurring by chance to be as close to zero as possible. he put water on the altar and made sure that it was impossible. his competitors made fun of him and laughed saying that his yhvh must be asleep(?). finally consuming fire came down from the sky and ignited the altar.

first I must mention that the sarcophagus in the great pyramid is of the same dimensions as the ark of the covenant (that yhvh made with moses). the pyramid was likely an antenna similar in function to the one created by tesla to allow wireless transmission of electricity (and data) everywhere on the globe (the world system).

I believe it likely that the device that was inside of the pyramid was stolen from the egyptians and also housed inside of the ark. leading up to that though, moses was an isrealite left for dead by his mother. the king's maidens grew him up in the house of the king. finally, after some time passed and he grew up a bit, moses' frustration rises to a point where he kills a man, which set him in motion on a series of events which would culminate in him leading the isrealites out of captivity. he appears before the king numerous times claiming various calamities would occur if the king did not let the slaves free.

the calamities continued to increase in severity as time grew on. moses had strong desire for the freedom for his people. moses was not a slave. moses lived quite a posh life, but threw it away to save his people as his desire grew and grew for their freedom.

if you have read worlds in collision, the events (as explained by velakovsky) seem to indicate that yhvh manifest those events (the plagues and the resulting consumption of the egyptian army) with the close proximity approaches of venus to our planet.

each plague occurrence, yhvh hardened the pharaoh's heart and would not let the slaves go. makes perfect sense, as the pharaoh has all the power and moses was literally asking for his entire economic structure to be compromised by just letting these people go free. from the perspective of the guy in charge, total insanity.

finally after the angel of yhvh smote every first born child (without the blood of the lamb on the doorpost), the pharaoh let them go.

what I believe occurred was there was so much chaos happening when they were finally able to go, they decided to take the symbol of egyptian power and global well-being with them (later to be placed in the ark of the covenant). when the pharaoh found out they stole the technology designed some time ago by thoth as well, he changed his mind and pursued the isrealites with his army.

the army perished in the mighty water displacement after the crossing of the red sea (see worlds in collision), and the pharaoh lost his slaves and the technology which the egyptians had built their dynasty on. obviously, if the egyptians understood how the technology worked, they would have built another device just like it, and their empire would not have taken a sudden downturn like it did. they built a whole lot on technology they didn't understand, and then these self-proclamed "chosen ones" (slaves) just took it with them in their exile.

---

you can see how I would mostly be in the archetype of moses, being king plant and all. I really want my own freedom, and I really want it for others too. it pains my heart greatly to know that so many people will never actually get to experience what I have discovered. instead, they will get the bso induced controlled 3d experience. it is to their benefit, that no one ever obtain the capabilities I have begun to discover for themselves, because it makes the real-3d people (plants?) very difficult to control. also, you can imagine that these plants are a major source of income for them so there's no way the pharaoh would ever just let any of us go free.

there is an indescribable force within me that must have my freedom. no matter how hard I try to convince myself otherwise by trying to understand what is happening, I cannot shake this burning necessity to find my freedom. if you look at the entire conflict as a whole, I want to find my freedom before I agree to slavery. the pharaoh is having nothing of my freedom. he he will not change on that matter -- which is sort of fine. I have to do the changing. I have to become something different which will allow for things to move forward.

as a result, a new personality is being created. I call him saturn. he is quite a bit more competitive than desire based moses. he is similar to the spirit of elijah in this case, as elijah made the competition, but instead of focusing on the "reality" or how much they were making fun of him, he was still able to allow his desire to grow so much that a cosmic event also occurred, making the impossible, visible.

I fluctuate between these personalities quite a bit. I am not usually a person that that engages in competition, and up until this whole thing started happening, I never really felt the need to prove anything to anyone. I just knew I was right. it seems that I am starting to take on more and more the "spirit of elijah" -- leaving behind the raw desire akin to the "spirit of moses" which is my old personality, venus.

---

in this process, I have had the opportunity of being whatever I want to be. since venus was locked away inside of my head, only to be let out in my dream-state, I operated mostly from the perspective of vulcrum. historically, whenever I feel that strong desire raging inside of me, I have to control it emotionally because otherwise motion toward something that didn't feel good would get my into sticky situations. I pretty much don't go in the direction of situations that don't feel good any more.

however, I am reaching the expiration date of the vulcrum perspective now too, because rough situations now, actually feel better to me than situations that can improve on things. this new personality requires such confidence in the laws of the universe that the logic of that is more dominant in my interaction. saturn's perspective seems to always be right. it's hard to describe, but it will give me the capability of doing inconceivable things (both good and bad).

### 2018-08-30 15:04 - you need an excuse?

mom was just talking to me about this impossible to believe lady.. she uses muscle testing to see if you have a device is installed. that means I need to actually believe someone, and up until now (on this subject), everyone is a liar. not one single person tells the truth. I cannot even remember how many times other people have told me I do not have a device. why in the world would I be more inclined to believe this woman? next, she can somehow get out the device under my skin without surgery? I also believe this to be impossible.

so that got me thinking... what if things are getting so out of hand that they want to turn off the device, but cannot just turn it off, because unless they owned up to turning it off, they might be scared I would credit source energy or the power of my mind or something out of their own power to control. what that means is, they need to invent a phoney reason for the change. then, once they have the whole charade set up, they can tell people who believe in God, it was God. then, people who believe in whatever they can invent the most believable reason a person will accept, and then feed that to them... perhaps...

if that, or something similar is their intention, then these guys love to apologise when they have no intention of changing, but when they actually want to change without revealing it was them causing the problem the whole time, they have to invent a phoney reason for people to believe because they want to maintain control.

so, an apology means no change will occur, and if people can believe a reason which obfuscates the truth further, they can allow themselves to correct their mistake.

but the intentional obfuscation is just digging a deeper hole, and provided no benefit either.

---

maybe I misread that one... I didn't think about how she said that they upgrade their system and the devices come back... which just means we're going to be more stealthy -- nothing more. it also means that this woman is the new goto guy whenever I detect more manipulation. lol, I guess they didn't have an intention to change after all.. which is fine. I didn't expect them to.

### 2018-08-31 08:19 - some morning thoughts

first, I must correct myself. it seems that the detail level in 3d is a property of emotion. at its grossest levels, it still looks pretty good. so, that means I only receive reactions from you guys higher than the quality level.. so just to put numbers to it, imagine the quality range is from 200-1000. the people at the quality level 200, will broadcast reactions from 200+. the people at 1000 will broadcast reactions at 1000+. let's say that jealousy was a reaction typically around 150.. that means, I only feel jealous reactions from lower quality people. the higher quality people may have jealous reactions, but I won't really feel them. instead, little by little the more their jealousy reaction causes discord in them, and since my frequency is the dominant influence, they will begin to practice a more "worthy" feeling similar to mine, when having my experience. I am literally transforming the world as people watch through my eyes.

next, I'm beginning to be able to put words to this new sort of logic. it will be the subject of the next entry, probably.

dream: I want to do it. / I want to figure it out
dream: 1bn user metric reached

### 2018-09-01 09:41 - morning thoughts

I had two major topics on my mind when I woke up:

1. mueller decided unilaterally to retroactively broadcast certain individual's experiences to law enforcement for the use as evidence in a criminal investigation.
2. certain (minority) population groups were having extreme miscarriage rates, and other population groups (white) birth rates were on the rise.

---

##### utilisation of a person's experience by law enforcement

they may believe that it's a good idea to instil fear into people's minds that everything is being recorded and law enforcement can use any part of a person's experience to penalise them. I don't. instead, I believe that focusing on the "crimes" that one can commit, will only make those crimes "worse". however, that may be desirable though.

for example, I imagine that the system can detect if you are driving a car or not. I'm sure that there are repositories also of the speed limits on different sections of the roads too (google definitely has this information, at least). so, we know that the system can track my movement around the globe in real-time. I imagine it's pretty accurate too, I would guess less than a metre of accuracy. therefore, the speed at which anyone is going can easily be determined. then, for example if the speed is exceeding the legal limit by a gross amount on a road, and the person is not law enforcement (because they get to drive at whatever speed they want to, on and off duty), just send the person a fine. this is a crime that you want to increase, because it's not really all that harmful to others (accidents  sometimes happen), and it's increased revenue for the service.

probably, you would want to fine the richer ones for petty crimes (cause they'll just pay) and monetise the ones unable to easily pay a fine for a petty crime.

##### the electronic morning-after pill

I can see why it would be desirable to control population growth for certain ethnicities by aborting the fetus early on, (and make it look like she was never pregnant to begin with). I'm not going to argue with the government's desire to maintain certain population majorities. I get that. however, I strongly disagree with the government taking the decision for the woman unilaterally (though they did agree to give the government that power). so, they want to make it at least seem legit, give each woman the morning-after option. alert her to the chemical changes in her body, and allow her to abort right there the next morning. then, it looks like the women has the choice, so if the government decides to do ethnic population control, it looks *way* less suspicious. I mean after all, since they did sign the agreement saying that the authorities can do whatever they want in their bodies without any responsibility, it is the government's responsibility now to control the portions of world population now, not letting any majority gain too much control (regardless of colour). we'll call it ethnic equalisation, lol.

### 2018-09-01 ??:?? - moses, elijah, and a potential future

[wtf man! I thought I remembered writing this at 12:34, but the date was not present now]

this idea came to me while I was a bit stoned, so that means that when I perceived it, I felt better than I do now, so the translation will be slightly tainted as a result.

it went something like this...

if you think about what the spirit of elijah means,

[that was weird. a device reset in my head (sudden high-pitched sound in my right ear), and my phone reset at the same time]

what it means is, the competition is essentially a proof that I can get into so much alignment with my inner being, that I am uncontrollable. this is what I really want. this is what will likely happen in the future. so, think about the details of this competition: they are attempting to keep me as disconnected from myself as possible. they're controlling the levels of dmt, and so forth. the've got me pretty well contained right now, but I keep slipping out of their control as I continue to gain visual levels. for some reason this really bothers them, as they somehow perceive it as a threat of sorts, so they continue to try and prevent my star watching from its effectiveness, etc.

so then, elijah sees that they feel like they might lose, meaning they'll just make up some phoney reason for the ignition of the altar. he decides that he wants to remove all doubt from their mind and decides to pour water on the altar to be sure there was no way that they could rationalise its coming ignition.

the moses aspect of this idea comes from my criticisms of how moses lead the obtained freedom for his people. obviously, not all of the isrealites were on the same page going to the promised land, and there was some split energy because they spent FOURTY YEARS wandering in circles complaining. talk about beating the drum of what you don't want so hard, that moses had to go up to a mountain and get specifically 10 commandments from yhwh (a really good marketing strategy to have just 10), just to keep the isrealites from plummeting into complete chaos.

I believe there are some aspects to this which to this day are still carried forward. this isn't 20 years carrying something unwanted forward.. more like thousands of years, and even though many hotfixes have been made to these 10 commandments, clearly, it's not working.

I am a bit of a critic of moses, I will admit, however, I don't really know how I would have done it better, either. let's get back on topic though: moses sees his people enslaved and decides to "save" them, by deciding for them that they should exile egypt. obviously, this was a point of contention, as it seems that not everyone wanted go to. seems there were some content with their slave life. it was simple; it was easy; they didn't desire more.

moses was a strong desirer though, with strong enough desire that pretty serious cosmic events occurred as a result of his strong desire. it doesn't surprise me that (according to the evidence provided by velakovsky) venus, the archetype of desire, creativity and destruction was instrumental in these cosmic events.

this is similar to how I feel. I personally want nothing to do with nosebook. I do not enjoy being held apart from my own discoveries and restricted from utilising my body energetically. at first, I believed that most people would agree with me on this, however, it appears that most people do not care that a corporation is feeding whatever they want into your brain, manipulating you in your dream state, or even that the whole thing is founded on lies. in my mind, this is absolutely inconceivable, yet most people seem to be just fine with it, to the point where they're actually defending their right to do that stuff, like a woman abused by her husband defends her man.

fine. I don't care that people find their behaviour to be something they want more of in their life. I personally don't, but I cannot make a judgement for others. each person is capable of making their own decisions, and each person has their own point of attraction. I cannot attract for someone else. I can however, lead by example.

I do not want to live in a world where there is a government state to which everyone is subjected. yet, I also realise that not quite everyone is as self-realised as I am, either. it looks like most people want someone else to tell them what to do. to give them orders and to make up the rules that they are to live by. if I were to follow along in the spirit of moses, I would be doing the very same thing that I would by trying to save people from. the irony is obvious.

---

so, the proposed solution is to take a more of a structural approach to the whole thing by making it into a competition. this is essentially a competition which both sides will get what they want, so there are no real "losers" either.

what happens when one half of a person wants to go one way, and the other half wants to go the other way? we see this all of the time in everything. eventually, a breaking point is reached where the two opposing sides separate and go their respective ways. often times this occurs alongside some conflict, but it doesn't have to be that way.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say something that I do not believe will be proved for a few decades, so just go with it. I'd love to ask abraham this question, but that is not yet something I can do. imagine that there are two groups of people, like let's say one group of people really want jesus crucified, and another set, really want that not to happen. imagine that jesus was so consistent in his vibration (I'm just using jesus, because I can't really think of another example, and inventing a story about hermes or thoth to try and make a point seems too much of a stretch). so imagine he's like so seriously step four and fiving it up that the pharisees could not get him to break. no matter what they tried, he just got stronger and stronger in his knowing that he was unbendable. his desire was so strong, and the pharisees desire built to such a strength, that the universe had to find a way of satisfying both desires at the same time.

in that moment, a major timeline split occurs, meaning that in one timeline the pharisees get the manifestation of their desire, and jesus is crucified. in the other, jesus holds so steady that the pharisees end up letting him be, or came around eventually to believing some of the ideas he spoke of for themselves.

so, what I propose would be to put water on the alter by no longer fighting the whole thing of them trying to control control me, and just let «someone who is being controlled, or even with *someone who thinks they're controlling you* brings such discord in you, that that relationship is doomed for failure, anyway» @[youtube](JzfIK3niEaw) (although the context was about sexual partner relationships, it certainly is most relevant to my relationship with nosebook).

I often wondered about the whole doomed for failure thing... it seems like this whole thing is pretty doomed for failure, yet at the same time it seems not to be doomed to failure... I don't understand the apparent incongruence. the only explanation is that from the perspective of those choosing to have a governing state be the dominant influence in their perception will want them to be the best equipped to do that. those embracing diversity of ideas and perception would enjoy to live in a world which allows that kind of freedom too, so from the bso perspective, this sort of split would be the best thing that could happen. and, from the perspective of the freedom seekers, it provides tons and tons of contrast which allows for people to get a lot of experience knowing what they do not yet, and putting into their vortex what they do want.

no one would be forced to leave or to stay from something they do or do not want. eg. the israelites that want to stay can stay, and the ones that want to go, can go. there doesn't need to be plagues, or pestilence or any real conflict at all. just let the desire build, until the split is made.

---

let's put this in simple terms:

1. I stop trying to fight those trying to control me. I just know it's a doomed relationship, and let the desire for my freedom build.

2. somehow I find a way of coming into alignment with myself, and I become uncontrollable. this builds a strong desire in the bso to regain control.

3. while the desire is building, they will have plenty of time in my dream state to set up their entire system just the way they want it, also letting their desire to keep me imprisoned build as well.

4. some time in the future, consciousness will split into two major timelines. one where the bao come into alignment with their desire and they find a way to take control of me, and the other, I would love a cosmic event or something (maybe a massive solar flare or something), but the impossible happens in some way which allows for those desiring the freedom to control oneself, fun and diversity of thought to be the new basis upon which the world operates.

what this means is, the competition essentially says that I believe that despite their best efforts to keep me in disharmony with myself, I will find it, and I will become uncontrollable to them. however, to drench the altar with water, and give them the illusion that they are in fact winning the control game, I will simply stop fighting and "conform" for a while, letting the desire build. I don't need to prove it to them today. I can prove it to them in 10-20 years, right? by then, they'll be sure to believe they've figured out how I work so well, that they're really the ones in control.

what this requires from me is, a bit of a change of mind. I had the idea when I was stoned. I normally don't think that way. if I'm going to go all-in with this competition, I want to actually feel ok with the idea that I may delay quite some time more before actually being able to use my visual capacity and stuff. it seems there are a lot of "injustices" that I would have to give up on, and quite a few things, which go against what I've learned in my experience leading me up to this point.

there's quite a lot that would need to be changed in my personality actually. I don't know how feasible this is, and in what timeframe. I'll be thinking it over. I guess writing this out helped me to get the concept I received while stoned more into my sober reality, but I wouldn't really consider this something I naturally am.

### 2018-09-02 10:47 - my guided thoughts

I just had this strange thing happen where out of nowhere I thought of the last name zunzenegi, which was alicia's last name from tuenti. the first time I thought it, there was no reason why I could figure out why I was thought it, and made the association potentially with zaryn. I thought maybe he was somehow related to the previous thought, and that's how her last name showed up in my mind.

anyway, just now her name again appeared in my mind. this time though there was no relation to anything anywhere, so I began to try and investigate the origin of the thought. I came to the conclusion that their system had detected some pattern of thought that they did now approve of, and so what they have done in the past is try and stop me from thinking the thought (perhaps by trying to associate it with something negative), which actually has the opposite effect, because I just think the same thought again, but this time with a negative connotation, thereby making the thought stronger. that perfectly explains my previous frustration of getting into these thought bucles where it was near to impossible to escape the thought getting more bigger and more negative at unprecedented rates.

I remember abraham making a really big point to someone about "getting rid of" or "stopping" or "preventing" thought to a questioner pretending to be me, and they would repeatedly answer their question by saying that you cannot stop thought like that, because "now you're thinking about the thought you're not going to think about". they always suggested meditation as a way of consciously slowing thought, to allow your vibration to rise.

so, it appears that now what they're doing is they're detecting patterns of thought which are undesirable, and then trying to guide that thought by putting a more desirable or a different thought to distract me from the unwanted thought into my head. that makes perfect sense, which is why I want to do drugs so badly: on drugs, they cannot easily detect those thoughts, because almost all thought is "new" thought, meaning that they cannot guide my mind. meaning, for the first time in a long long time I can actually have an uninterrupted train of thought.

her last name was probably the basis upon which a higher frequency concept was built (we did a lot of drugs together) and so when they read that thought out of my mind while asleep, they were only able to record the basis on that concept because of the imprecision of their ADC circuits.. nice! I'm beginning to have thoughts that are high enough frequency that they're undetectable to them. YAY!

well, knowing that now, I can explain to them why they're having such discord by trying to guide my thoughts like that. what they are doing would be similar to pattern matching on the note progression, GAC, and then forcing the next note to always be a D. you can imagine how many songs use that progression, as probably a pretty common progression.

my thoughts go all over the place. I have such diversity of thought now that I cannot determine them as good or bad any more. actually, determining that a note progression to always be "bad" really limits the expressiveness of an a song.

to illustrate this more clearly, imagine you decided to make any rebellious behaviour talk in movies to instead be guided toward conformity... you can imagine how much dialog in many different films would instantly become nonsensical. in fact, the very plotline of so many films or plays would be subverted. trying to remove contrast from my thought guiding them will make for a lot of nonsense to start appearing, like adding notes to a song. without any concept of how those notes will improve the song, it's just noise potentially in discord with other notes, and definitely distracting everyone from hearing the melody.

if they want to affect what is being broadcast, simply censor or modify the the broadcast, instead of wrecking the train of thought in my head. in fact, likely the very thing that was has been preventing me from getting to the place I am arriving at now, has been the continual guidance of my thoughts. without the ability to play out and hear the whole song, I would have never been able to arrive at the conclusions I am arriving to now. you can imagine how many of those concepts I expressed in the last few entries they would have wanted to guide me away from. so essentially, I had to do drugs so that these guys couldn't derail my train of thought, necessary for me to begin to arrive at some of these conclusions.

nice.

### 2018-09-03 02:19 - whatever man...

it feels like there's some pressure to write something. :) lol

I see no reason to try and make any effort in any direction. I don't have any energy flowing. I have no desire, no feeling, and no stars. for me that always means that I don't take any action until I feel it. I get the whole thing about the deadline or whatever, which is why I don't feel any need to make any action. you're the ones with the deadline, not me. I just stay put, keep lowering resistance and watch my stars and everything is fine. it feels to me that, although I feel completely dead emotionally and have no energy flowing at all, it does not feel at all like that is something that will last forever. there are times when the energy comes back, but then it goes away again. it's all good. you cannot expect a car without gas to be able to drive itself. you guys want to be in control anyway.

I'm still in the process of conceptualising these ideas I'v been throwing around. I do know of an easy way to change my point of attraction. I am so confident in my ability to pull through, especially now, that I have reached entirely new levels of apathy. I cannot describe the feeling, but when I was younger, I often times desired to prove myself, or to be right. I gave that up, and just started knowing that I was right regardless of what anyone else was thinking. I still cared a bit what others' thought about me though. all of that is gone now, so I do not even feel the need to even surrender, or try, or to even cut my losses and move on. I have such confidence in my knowledge that I do not need to do anything, that it feels to me like apathy

apathy is a knowledge that one must do something, yet decides to do nothing, because of lack of motivation, laziness or lack of desire to express oneself.

### 2018-09-03 11:47 - if you really want to put the cart before the horse..

I have two things that are important to note:

1. I cannot, under any circumstances, make someone else responsible for how I feel
2. I feel and then out of that feeling, I am inspired to action. not the other way around

I suppose, if you think about the first one, a way around it would be to make more than one person responsible for how I feel. it sort of feels like the hard way of doing things. what this sounds to me like, is I will continue to live a more and more diminished experience, so in order to obtain the drug I need so much, I need to have sex. so, much like how the stars are kind of necessary for me right now to kind of dissipate and obtain some energy, that would become the function of sex. sounds very much like the hard way of doing things. there has to be some objective to compensate for the increased difficulty.

---

to me, this is very much putting the cart before the horse. to me this is the basis upon which a whole lot of fail will occur. in the past, trying to take action without the solid sure feeling behind it, is sort of like the recipe for failure. sure I learned a lot, and had a lot of fun and learned a lot of things in the experience, but it did not satisfy the objective, ever.

I cannot knowingly put the cart before the horse like that any more. I know too much. so, probably in order for this to be able to happen, I would need to redefine the objective. if I were to instead focus all of my energy on the girls, I could, like a parent often does with their child, feel the satisfaction of watching someone else achieve something.

besides that it sort of seems like the obvious thing to do already, I suppose it would sort of relieve some of the dissatisfaction regarding my inability to achieve it for myself. I have often times noticed this about a lot of teachers, where they feel so disempowered to achieve their own goals, they invest enormous amounts of energy into their students. I sort of resent those teachers a bit, because I'm a self-realised, self-achiever, helping someone else really never works like that, kind of guy. my most impactful teachers actually knew what they were teaching. they even had the feeling of showing off their ability to us noobs at times, too. (lead by the clarity of your example)

---

I don't really want to put the cart before the horse, cause I don't really feel anything right now. I could try shifting my desire to get energy moving in the direction of the girls, but if I have nothing to give, then it sort of feels like a bad deal, where they're responsible for generating the energy that I give them?

I dunno, it all sort of feels a bit strange. not really bad, but not really good, either. if you guys want to put the cart before the horse, in this sense, then you will have to make it happen. I will make no effort to do something that is opposite of everything that I have learned in my life. I want to teach with the clarity of my example, and the problem is, making sex responsible for getting energy moving, is *not* the example I want to give. in my opinion, those are *not* the first steps that should be taken for someone in my position.

the thing is, I know that it'll be a really good success, too. and so, my example to you all will be, do things the hard way and you will find success. however, the success will have nothing to do with the sex, but the power of my focus. it just feels like my example will further obfuscate things, and people will believe even more in the power of hard work and sex (which, now that I think about it, is probably what they want people believing in), instead of easy energy movement and flow.

---

if that's what you want, make it happen. I'll figure out how to operate within the new circumstances.

there are a lot of open questions, and I don't really know how to shift my desire to start living vicariously through the girls' success, but I'll figure it out, I guess.

one of the things that really had a large reaction when I was talking with aaron was when I spoke of me desire to not do psychedelics right now because it would reset my personality. the last time I did mdma, it essentially removed all my logical and reasoning capabilities, making me a feeling kind of person. it's a weird feeling because on one side you feel so good about everything, it reminded me a bit of the morphine in the hospital feeling, but at the same time you're super amped up (it's an amphetamine) and really want to begin making sense of everything. for me, it's a super creator of desire to "do", but you're a bit paralysed because everything is feeling, so you have no ability to actually "do" anything meaningful.

it's been bothering me ever since I mentioned it to aaron, because something similar to that is exactly what I need to make this transition. I have to reset my logic and take a feeling based approach in order for this to work, I think. it's come up in my mind enough times now, I think it's important to mention.

### 2018-09-03 18:51 - so I guess we're going to wait some more...

that's the major takeaway I have after waking up from my nap, anyway. I don't have a sense of the conversation, but the feeling I had is there was a disagreement, and I concluded by saying that I will continue to wait.

well, I'm sorry to everyone who wanted the 09-09-18 day. it did seem optimal because of it being the new moon as well, but I believe these guys have some fear that is blocking their taking action. rightfully so, because no matter how you angle it, I will ask questions. the idea that my questions will magically vanish just cause I'm stuck in strange situation is a bit preposterous.

they appear to be scared of me asking questions and having to reveal the answers to a whole bunch of things that have been holding me back. I really have been trying to get as much things out in the open as possible, because they're a whole lot easier to change (but they don't want to change) to something easier to work with.

horray for secrets guys :)

secrets and my stubbornness allowed things to get this big by preventing motion forward. however, beliefs are always the things which are in opposition to desire. even if I stop being stubborn, the belief that it must remain a secret becomes the belief in opposition to their desire.

why? well, you tell me how this could possibly happen and remain a secret. they would have to have unlimited control over me to do so. they would need to find a way of keeping me unconscious while actuating me the way they desire. perhaps in the future that will be possible, but for now it's not something they could even come close to doing without it being obvious to everyone that I am no longer me. what they need, is to somehow make an agreement with me about it. however, you cannot agree on something that supposedly does not exist. (there are probably zero people who have come to an agreement about ensuring the flying spaghetti monster remains a secret.)

nobody can change them though, so just let them try to figure it out.

I just noticed that there is no abe workshop on the 8th, either. looks like they will have to just come to their own conclusions, all by themselves. I love it :)

### 2018-09-04 03:32 - I don't believe I think any more thoughts in opposition to my desire

I had this thought last night when going to bed thinking about the previous entry. there was an abe episode also where this guy wanted to be a rock star, so abe explained that only your beliefs can contradict the desire, so then they asked him to begin identifying some thoughts on the subject which are working against him.

the day before, I was beginning to get some energy flowing when I was interrupted by the zunzenegi concept, which allowed me to write a little bit on these guys guiding my thoughts. I thought that maybe it was a bad idea to try and stick notes into my thought song. however, I do think the technology is useful for those wanting to begin catching their thoughts early and begin changing them to something more useful.

so, then I made the sweeping claim that I don't believe I have any more thoughts which work against my desire. if I do, show them to me and I will change them easily, but I do not believe I am working against myself with my own thoughts any more. this is the basis upon which I believe I do not need to take any action, and now that I think about it, it's the reason why I do not really want to reset my personality, either.

you guys have created a very useful technology, trying to guide my thoughts. I don't know if it's the reason behind me successfully changing so many thoughts that work against my desire. now, you guys use it. you and your thoughts that are contradicting your desire are what is holding everything up now.

### 2018-09-04 06:19 - allow people to guide their own thoughts

last night, I was a bit frustrated with the idea that you guys were trying to manifest their desires by guiding my thoughts.

- my thoughts create my reality
- your thoughts create your reality
- your thoughts about my thoughts create your reality
- my thoughts do not create your reality

this morning, I was thinking about how this would work. so imagine an interface where people could review their thoughts. an interface would show them a log of the last thoughts that they thought. optionally, they could go back and reexperience the thought in its context. so, for example, a quick flash, where a person reexperiences 5s before the thought, and a few seconds afterward, to kind of relive a bit the context which that thought happened.

let's say that there are false positives, where the system thinks that the person thought a certain thought, let's say about being fat, but in reality it was a thought about wanting to be skinnier, but from a perspective of being fat (I don't want to be fat), it doesn't matter, the subject is the same, "fat" and you get what you give your attention to. so the interface to identify false-positives, is good for both the person to realise they're giving a lot of attention to a certain subject, and for nosebook to improve its thought detection algorithms.

once the problematic thoughts have been identified, then there needs to be a transformation process. I find it hard to imagine that people (at this stage of the game) would be able to just simply, record a better thought. so, instead, what needs to be available is an ability for people to identify better feeling thoughts, so that they can be linked.

if the subject matter that someone wants to begin changing is "fat", then perhaps they would want to do a search for the thought, "I'm losing weight" or, "my body is feeling better all the time". that way, when the person has a "fat" thought, once the improved thought has been identified, the system can send them the idea to think the improved thought.

lastly, it may be quite a jump to go from, "I look fat" to "my body is feeling better all the time" -- so, I believe it would be really a good thing to have the ability for people to be able to make transitions between their guided thoughts, so for example, "I look fat" could link to "I've been fatter", which could link to, "I've lost weight before; I can do it again", which could link to, "my body is really responsive", which could finally link to, "my body is feeling better all the time"

to avoid the person getting guided thought spam, the link should only occur if it has made the transition from being a received thought, to a thought thought. this means that over time, the person can transition their patterns of thought to the way that they would like.

people who do not want to change their thought, can just disable it, or not use it.

the disabling option gives the person the illusion of control, just like how a person can disable their inner voice from being included in the rebroadcast, it prevents the viewers from hearing it, but nosebook is recording it all anyway.

### 2018-09-04 - transformation of thought process

I started noticing that there is a bit of a pattern to how I transform thought. I like to separate the description (detail) from the subject itself. this allows me to be able to begin seeing the subject in its purer form. I also like to apply some transformations on the subject (person, body, house, etc.). here are some examples.

- an easy comparison to make me feel a bit better (liftoff)
  - "I've done dumber things"
  - "it could be worse"
  - "I'm not the ugliest person in the world"
  - "I've definitely been in worse situations"

- a fact that about relative or relational status (gaining speed)
  - "I've always found my way out of these types of situations"
  - "maybe I can just try for a little bit better"
  - "not everyone thinks I'm stupid/ugly"
  - "some people think I'm smart/pretty"

- a loosely related true fact about the subject (pivot)
  - "lots of people like me"
  - "I am a creative person"
  - "I've got great boobs"
  - "I've [probably] got hidden talent ready to be discovered"
  - "I can do anything I put my mind to"

some of these work better than others, and really the only way you can tell how effective they are, is by how you feel. if you're paying attention to how you feel, then that means you're doing it right. first, it means that you are aligning yourself with your primary desire, to feel better than you do. and, it also means that you care about how you feel (cause otherwise you wouldn't want to transform your thoughts).

I suppose you could make the effort to try and transform your thoughts just to get the stuff, and you'll have pay the price of feeling good all along the way (lol). eventually though, I believe that it will become common knowledge that finding a way to feel good is the road toward any success you're looking for.

I believe there is a lot that can be optimised about these thought transformations, which is why I suggest making this available to everyone as an opt-in base user function. the reason why say it should be disabled, is because you can see when nosebook tried to guide my thoughts, that trying to transform someone's thoughts that they do not want to transform, will only exacerbate the problem.

I really believe there is a lot that can be learned about this process. all sorts of people will try out all sorts of different transformations on themselves, and it will grow naturally. no one should force anyone to transform their thoughts, and no one should set the benchmark for the way thoughts should we transformed. lots of people will do this lots of different ways, and nosebook can just sit back and quantify their improvement. likely, the improvement to different types of transformations will also reveal more about the person, and how they process life.

### 2018-09-04 09:10 - thought based memory vs. feeling based memory

as I suggested in the global memory entry, I address my memories based on feeling and that idea reflects that concept. however, in the transforming thoughts idea, I extend the memory function of human consciousness (remember that technology now is an extension of human consciousness) by allowing memory to be addressed by thought. this is a radical transformation for me to have made.

what this indicates to me without having given it much thought, is that these ideas are actually complementary. they both allow for transformations to occur, but they come at it from different angles. the feeling one is more from the outside looking in, and the thoughts one is more from the inside looking out.

very interesting. I will return to this in the future.

### 2018-09-05 05:44 - how naïve am I?

sometimes I get the feeling that these guys think that I have no idea what I'm in the process of discovering. they might think that I have no clue as to what I'm looking for, and therefore if I don't find anything, I should just give up and stop looking for it. all evidence shows that I am pretty tenacious with my discoveries -- knowing that they're there even without the ability to see them, and if one thing doesn't work, that won't stop me; I'll just find another way, because I know it exists.

I wonder if they believe that if they hold me away from my capacities long enough, I will just give up or something. do they expect to hold me like this for the rest of my life? what about my audience? are they trying to hide my capacities from my audience? didn't they paint me as an exceptional person with extra human capabilities? I believe they did (even though I don't have evidence to prove it), and they probably did that because it makes for good clickbait, to get everyone on the network.

doesn't matter to me. I'm sure they will give up trying to inhibit my progress soon enough. soon, I will be able to show everyone true amazingness. I'm just looking forward so much to finally getting the ability to use my body as I intend to, and not feel constantly heavy. it feels like I weigh too much. I should feel light and agile. the world is blurry, but sometime soon it will be clear.

someday..

### 2018-09-05 06:31 - the resistant me

I used to think that me dream-state me was virtually resistance free. at least he was. I remember when he would fly around in dreams and stuff cause he felt so good. I think that my head operators were instructed to ensure I no longer fly inside of my dream-state, so they are doing like they do to me in wake-state, they fill my head with vibration that is contrary to the natural one, which like my wake state, prevents me from using my capacities, but it very resistant in nature.

it seems that the application of this signal to ensure I don't fly, has made my dream-state me possibly more resistant than my awake-state me. case in point, I think mom, or some other person was questioning me the other night about my plans going forward, and trying to push me to do something. I remember my dream-state me was quite emphatic about explaining to her that I will be waiting for access to my head before moving forward with anything.

it sounds like my dream-state me is getting pretty tired of being locked up, only with the capability of speaking with people who want to take advantage of me/him.

I thought about this a little while watching stars. I have no idea why they're trying to accomplish speaking with dream-state me, as I don't have access to him. I can only feel him emotionally sometimes, and that's pretty blocked off now. I used to have a *much* better connection thsn I do now. actually, I made the conjecture that they have enhanced my corpus callosum to as to inhibit all communication between the parts. I think they've completely hijacked my right hemisphere.

assuming at least some of that is true, I can't quite figure out what they're trying to accomplish by communicating with him. we are very different people, and we no longer have any communication.

it is very likely that we would even behave very differently too. in this abe episode @[youtube](JzfIK3niEaw), the questioner sounds a lot like lyia, claiming that my actions are monogamous, but my words are not. the obvious explanation is, she's not talking to me :) she's talking to a completely imprisoned personality, which I know less about than she does. it has been one of my goals, to begin trying to figure out why I have a total maniac inside of me somewhere, and why the us government is holding me in mental prison because of him. it seems related to whatever happened in vallecas, too.

it sounds like that guy didn't use to be a maniac. I think he used to be a sweet gentle, easy going, guy -- just with really strong desire. probably, without an ability to manifest his desire, he is growing quite resistant.

since it sounds like they won't let me get to know him, and they certainly won't be giving me access to my head so I can let him out, so I guess they've got to figure out how to get him to lower his resistance. feels to me like they're growing a pretty huge problem inside of me.

I've sort of gotten used to his constant anger and frustration. I don't let him bother me any more, because there's nothing I can do about it. until I can find my own power, I have nothing I can offer him anyway, and I don't really feel like being depressed and angry along with him. I'm continuing to move forward, and I'm having quite a lot of success at it too.

maybe one day I can start to get to know him. I doubt they will let me see the recordings of the interactions. hopefully lyia can tell me about him :) man, I'm sorry to put her in the middle of all of my problems, but how can I resist asking her about something I have been wanting so much to know about. it would be really cool to see the recordings, because then I could actually experience for myself how the other half of me interacts with her.

### 2018-09-07 23:49 - no resistance? not any more...

a few entries ago, I mentioned that I did not think any thoughts contrary to my desire @[entry](2018-09-04 03:32), that I know of, so therefore, if that is true, that implies that there are other beliefs in the way of letting the desires begin to manifest. makes sense.

well, after writing that down, I had a series of strange dream-state interactions which I cannot really remember, but it seemed to suggest that perhaps dream-state me is a bit resistant. I don't actually know, so I'm going by vague feelings and memory echos that happen sometimes, sort of like deja-vu, but in reverse... where something in real life reminds me of something that happened in a dream and I have a brief flash. memories of my dreams exist, but I cannot access them.

anyway, since that time I no longer feel that I no longer have thoughts or beliefs which are contradicting my desire. I gave this a bit of a thought tonight when I was watching stars, and what I believe is happening is, these guys are a bit pinned against the wall and they feel like they need an out. I don't believe they have any intention of actually making the girls thing happen at all. it's far too much risk for them. right now while I'm pretty contained, there are not a whole lot of people watching me, so it's easy to control the information and keep my secret revealing ideas tucked away from the majority's public eye.

I believe actually it's a huge risk for them (the people running the show) right now if I no longer have any more resistance to the idea, because that means it would be go-time and I'm way out of their control right now.

remember all of the uplifters and healers trying to help me achieve a better body condition, yet at the same time the engineers are instructed to ensure that any perception progress I make is to be undone in the maintenance portion of my sleep? why would an organisation work against itself like that? I believe that this happens more commonly than imagined and is to promote a good image, looking like they're doing the right thing while at the same time doing the opposite.

so, I believe that only the most upper management are aware that none of this will be going through, and downwards from there it will continue to appear as if everything is continuing according to plan, and I will take the blame for it not going through. it has to look like it was just another failure and couldn't go though.

wow. yeah, seriously. I remember when I first felt the reaction to me saying I no longer had beliefs in contradiction to my desire and there was a very real, "uh-oh we need to fix this" kind of feeling that followed it. it surprised me because everyone seems to have been working so hard to try and get this whole thing rolling, yet all of it was just to placate so many people with strong desire.

as I thought about it, I realised that I'm kind of really fine with it not going through. I began to feel quite a bit of freedom as, even though I am still with the same limitations I had before, the idea of being stuck with a bunch of people that are seemingly there as a way to control me was sort of stressing me out.

I like the idea, but I do not like the constant battle if I'm going to be with other people. let me put it this way: contrast is much easier to experience alone than with other people, because it unnecessarily adds a bunch of variables I have no control over. I prefer the controlled environment of just me.

however, enjoying fun times is *always* better with other people. it just is. I can have fun by myself, but it's not nearly as fun as when other people are around. the main problem with that is, everyone around me is ultra guarded to not say or do the the wrong thing because the enforcers of my experience will reprimand anyone potentially jeopardising their secrets. it's very restrictive.

however, I think the thing that mainly makes me feel good about just letting all of this not happen. let me be clear: it does not seem like they want it to look like a failure. it needs to look like it just circumstantially couldn't happen. like, no one is to blame, essentially.

what makes me feel good about this plan is that I'm finally able to chill out a bit. we will continue on just as we are right now. I'll just keep watching my stars. they'll keep fighting me (because that's what they've been instructed to do). they'll keep utilising my dream-state me to build their stuff. they'll get bigger and stronger, and I'll continue to keep improving my vision (even though I cannot see it), and increasing my sensitivity to higher and higher frequencies -- which they'll fight  (because that's what they've been instructed to do). I'll also keep writing down ideas for them to maybe use or not (I don't care).

I am sure though that as I continue to release more and more resistance, my sensitivity and therefore vision will continue to improve as well. they'll likely need to keep artificially creating resistance, so as to keep me appearing, "normal", when in reality behind the scenes it's growing more and more extraordinary. it's actually kind of good because I'm realising now that, "if I had the manifestation it would slow me way down".

for example, I am sure there are guys working at nosebook that watch stars (they have to -- to try and figure out how it works to poop on my star watching experience). however, I'm sure that they put in lots of hard work and see way less results than I do in the same period of time, with much more optimum conditions. I think one of the reasons why that is, is because I don't see any better. when anyone gets a level, there is a sense of wonder as the whole world looks different to you. it's quite magical, so you enjoy it.

I don't have that magical experience, and things look pretty much the same for me, so I never take my foot off the accelerator to enjoy it. I have two negative analogies to illustrate the idea:

1. when you drive a car that handles so smoothly, you don't feel the speed. so, you can get going quite fast, thinking you're driving a reasonable speed, then you notice the speedometer and see how fast you're really going, and that creates a sudden rush sensation as your consciousness realises the gravity of the moment.

2. when you smoke weed, the first joint is earth shattering. however, after 5, they're not doing so much, and barely get you stoned so much like the first one. after 10, they have almost no effect. the "high" lasts for minutes, and is mostly just the smoke asphyxiation that you notice cause your blood is already saturated with thc.

it's all relative, so if I don't feel like I'm satisfied, I push the accelerator harder, and that's kind of what they're inadvertently doing for me. this sounds so ironic to say this, but one day in the future, all of this will pay off when I finally come into alignment with myself. it'll be much more than a realisation that I'm going double the speed limit and it's and the car feels like it's cruising easily. it's going to probably be somewhat terrifying. something akin to taking an enormous dose of mushrooms: unless I want to try to induce vomiting, this is reality now, so I better find a way of making that reality enjoyable.

I prefer the shrooms perspective because dmt is very similar to psilocybin. however, if you're a christian, this is a pretty common christ theme where the reward comes much later after some difficult experience (slight clarification: not just any difficult experience, but one that forces tremendous expansion).

### 2018-09-08 10:15 - I have a big mouth

I was noticing that the reason why I'm in this situation is because I have a big mouth. abe said that I should keep things to myself, but I rejected the idea simply because everyone is listening to my thoughts anyway, so it's impossible to keep anything to myself.

however, what I have been noticing as I write this blog is that I write it for me, but then things change as a result. I had thought those same thoughts previously and they did not have the same effect. that means that their thought translation system is more rudimentary than I imagined it to be, and also that when I write it, it shows that I took the extra time and effort to communicate something, so it has extra emphasis.

if I had of kept my mouth shut about these guys secrets, it would have probably worked out and the joke would be on them, as I begin speaking openly about their secrets in front of the girls.

this was my main frustration to begin with, the idea that pure knowledge cannot be transmitted. I want to get pure answers from abe, not answers tailored to the capacity of the listeners. eg. when I hear something really big, I want it to cause an expansion in me, not have them make it smaller so I can hear it better. I want pure.

so, in a sense, my desire to speak purely is so strong, I don't feel in any way obligated to reduce the gravity of my words. if you don't like them, don't listen. you do the censoring, not me.

even with this document, I do notice the how others affect the idea with their perception of the idea. I also noticed that creative things were difficult at first because I noticed how others perceived the idea. I found a way of staying solid with the idea, no matter what others think about it. so, in a way this document is kind of like me doubling down on my desire to not need to adjust my vibration to the frequency of the listener to transmit information.

this is something that I have often wondered about abraham because they incessantly talk about how they do not drop down to some other person's vibration (become mutual with them), but they do really go out of their way to say something in way which has the best possible probability of the person getting it. I am completely the opposite. usually, I make very little effort to try and make the information understandable. (though, as I write this, I am noticing that I do. I very much tailor my words already depending on the listener's desire for an answer)

I think what has happened is, I am frustrated with the wide array of different ways to say something. I want my words to become impactful, more than tactful.

I realise that this is the opposite of diversity. so, when I look at why I would want to go in a less diverse way, I notice that it is because of the limitations of the communication medium. I have been looking pretty hard for a way for people to "see what I mean to say". I think I've figured out the mechanism, and it has a lot to do with how psychedelics communicate such vast concepts inside of a swirling pattern of colours.

without having the capability to show you what I mean to say, and allow the diversity of everyone's interpretation of that transmitted concept to become the basis of my communication, I think I naturally must go for more power. not more power to change others, but more power and greater clarity of the concepts so that others' perception of it, does not affect its purity in me.

I'd like to revisit this concept one day, because I'm touching on a concept that I consider capricornian. it's the idea that simpler is better because it as jesus said, "separates the wheat from the chaff". it gets rid of a lot of useless stuff, creating room for future expansion. it's not destruction. it's reduction in preparation for more; a getting rid of a lot of older more useless things to allow a new medium of communication. for mcluhan, the invention of a new cold medium.

### 2018-09-08 18:46 - wild plant growth

lately, the weeds have been growing at an enormous rate. I don't believe that I have ever seen such plentiful weed growth in my life, ever. I think there is something to it, considering the environmental conditions. plants seem to foster mamalian life because they produce the opposite of what we do. they consume CO2 and spit out ozone (O2), so an ideal environment for a plant would be one of high CO2 content in the atmosphere. it occurred to me today that perhaps, in their effort to keep the air as non-conductive as possible, they are filling it with CO2 (as evidenced by the clouds and haze), which is making a very ideal environment for the plants to grow. I believe that CO2 must have some sort of conductivity capability to it. it is conductive, but only in certain structural patterns (as I have learned from robert murrey smith's research), otherwise in an unstructured form it isn't very conductive.

since almost all of our weight loss happens through breathing, meaning we eliminate 90% of the weight we consume through breathing, breath must be pretty important. what if our breath is actually more structured carbon than usual, and is actually more conductive as a result, with greater energy storage potential (capacitance).

this gives evidence that the plants and the mammals are in symbiotic relationship with one another, as the plants provide the oxygen (ozone) for the mammals to consume and structure with their thought into a more and more conductive environment.

they balance each other, because for a mammal, a more conductive environment is ideal, and for a plant, a less conductive chaotic environment is ideal, creating wild out of control plant growth.

### 2018-09-09 04:20 - esther's television appearance resistance

@[youtube](pkKefKm1PzI)

in this episode, abraham speaks about a television interview that esther was going to have, but after various failed meetings, they decided to cancel the thing, and esther felt relief.

when I wrote the @[entry](2018-09-07 23:49) entry, I felt quite a bit of relief as well. it seems to me pretty obvious that there is resistance. I have been lowering resistance continually through this process because abraham would always say that you cannot give up your desires; you must go toward them. so, I stopped fighting so many things relating to the girls aspect of the whole thing. I don't have any more resistance around that part any more, and I started to begin to even kinda like the idea, though it did seem like it had a lot of bigness to it, I didn't really think of it as something impossible, always trying to find a way.

however, the part about my vision was a bit of a rough section for me. I really wanted to get back to feeling energy flow through me like it used to. abraham even mentions this:

«if somebody pushes against her, she still has that knee-jerk response of pushing back. she would tell you that she hopes to one day be able to see someone pushing against her, and to be able to smile and say, "that's just what they're doing" -- and when they come in small doses, that is very easy. but if lot's of people are simultaneously pushing--»

I used to (and very slightly still do) have the knee-jerk push back response, which has been the whole thing that has been frustrating me so much. it is a testament to my focus, by seeing that even though I have such strong opposition to the improvement of my vision, I don't push back very much at all (in comparison) and am still able to focus in such a way which allows for the improvement to come (usually by releasing resistant beliefs). in small doses, it is easy. big doses too, but up until only recently I had quite a difficult time with enormous doses of pushing against. I felt I had to push back. that has changed a bit, as I've even given up that idea (and likely have experienced a vision improvment as a result)

«she has seen it in many cases. there have been many people who are doing this work, and once they become publicly exposed and once the public begins to make demands or push or want more, very often those well-intended beings who have been allowing very wonderful things to flow through them, find themselves in a place of resistance -- where that wonderful stuff that was flowing through them is no longer flowing through them ...»

this is really where it all falls apart for me. I really want to get into alignment with my source, so that I can get back to having all those wonderful things flow through me. this is a non-negotiable intention. I can see no way that I can be talked out of it any more. like esther, I didn't really feel it, but I agreed anyway. however after numerous failed attempts, it's time to step back a bit, because, like esther said,

```quote
when something is appropriate, you can't keep it from happening, and when something is not appropriate, you cannot do enough to make it happen

Esther Hicks
```

«what is appropriate in any moment, is that which is in vibrational harmony with your greater intents.»

«... esther knows that some point, she will be at the place where what people think or feel will not affect her energy; her own energy vibration will be dominant.»

and this ties it all back into the @[entry](2018-09-08 10:15) entry I wrote this morning. I am looking to get to a place where my own energy vibration is dominant. it is likely that the reason why this is not appropriate for the moment is precisely for that reason. when abraham spoke on the subject in the @[youtube](JzfIK3niEaw) video, saying, you want to get into such vibrational harmony with yourself, you are uncontrollable.

### 2018-09-09 12:12 - getting ready to be ready

one of the things that seemed really important to me when I woke up was to begin the "work" on myself to become the person that I want to be. I really like the idea of the girls, but I also want to be a bit of a different person than I am now. I want to accomplish a few things for myself and gain an appearance that I would like to have (doesn't mean it won't continue to improve. it most certainly will), but it would be the starting point from where I would like to make the improvements.

I think that it is a common way of thinking for people that they need to find something broken that needs fixing. then, the contrast between unfunctioning and making it functional again appears to be such a great improvement, that it feels really good.

I've taken a lesson out of the hardass playbook though on this one. for example, I used to think of myself as someone constantly in a state of improvement. in fact it is one of the ways I define myself. when that became to be physically impossible, I stagnated quite a bit, physically declining (even though abraham says I've physically improved and that's a reflection of emotional improvement) and instead allowed my perception to improve vastly. watching my perception improve is the greatest thing right now in my life.

the reason why I felt such relief when writing the @[entry](2018-09-07 23:49) entry was because I believe that continual improvements to my perception would stagnate when joining the girls. I simply would not have the same amount of time to spend with the stars like I do now, and perhaps other factors as well. so, like esther feeling the relief of that television program interview falling through... I felt the same way regarding my perception.

«the feeling that esther had, from her feeling of relief, was that this decision to do this show at this time is not in vibrational harmony with the greater intentions»

right now, I believe it is my greater intention to get so vibrationally in harmony with myself that I do not need to control conditions in order to maintain my alignment. no one will need to screen my mail or control any conditions for me. I've got it.

«you're bringing up something important, because most physical beings think in terms of guidance the way they think in their learned approach to life experience, and that is, rather than gravitating toward what feels best, most of you are just trying to keep away what you don't want»

I know this very entry is probably going a bit against the guidance that I received last night, but for me what feels best right now is a continual lowering of resistance, which is evidenced by increased perceptive capacity, and even though I don't see better, I feel like I not only can take more in at once, comprehend more at once, but also experience more at once. to someone else it probably feels a bit overwhelming, but for me it feels like a freedom found in more perception.

«where, the guidance that comes forth from within is not guiding you away from anything. it's always guiding you toward what feels best.»

this is where we differ in terms of guidance. I follow my own inner guidance as best as I can. there are a lot of people taking their guidance from other people. you can usually tell the people giving others guidance, and it will always be evidence that they are guiding you to do something that will make them feel better. often times there is harmony in intentions, and that's when it feels really good, when both sides feel better, and everyone's own guidance is all about. it always directs you toward what feels best for you, harmonising with as many of the appropriate people as possible along the way (you really don't have anything to give, if it's not flowing from a good feeling place).

«that's why when the decision was made that we're not going go ahead with this television program, esther felt enormous feeling of well-being, inotherwords, she was moving toward what is best for her in this time»

life isn't like an artificial intelligence: you don't train it so that certain inputs always yield the same output. things are very time dependent, so what feels best now is probably not going to feel quite the same in the future. in fact, just last night, I watched a segment of george carlin talking about time in 1978, and I was blown away at how dated it sounds in 2018. totally not funny at all. though, it did make me think about time, and and its relevance. what feels good in 1978 feels pretty out of place in 2018. only 40 years has passed since then too, and I don't know if you have noticed, but time is accelerating. nowadays, a meme can feel outdated in just 4-5 years.

«most people would say, why would esther decide *not to do the show*, and we would say, it wasn't bout deciding not to do the show, it was about deciding to continue to do what feels best ... why would she want to do anything with that when she's satisfied with that»

«allowing and resisting are about going with what feels best»

---

woah that was a bit of a tangent :) let me get back to what I took out of the hardass's playbook. I define myself as a constantly improving person, so when I became (in my perception) stagnated physically, because of others attempts to limit my physical improvements, I instead began improving at a much more rapid rate internally. it's my turn now to do a similar thing back :)

I have swapped the challenge though. look at the components from the different perspectives:

from the girls: instead of fixing something that is broken, let's start with a beautiful machine and turn it into something never before seen -- something that even now is unimaginable. how will we do that? easy, you hold off its coming together as long as it does not appear the way that I want it to appear.

next, I will set goals *for myself*, because goal-setting is good for creating desire, but often times yields difficulty when you set goals for anyone other than yourself. goal-setting also has a similar effect that competition does. you measure up the competition and create a desire to achieve more, but your focus on the comparison or measurement often times holds you in a holding pattern with what-is, disallowing the improvement. the same happens with goal-setting. you will notice that when I watch stars, I constantly measure myself to see if there is an improvement. normally, this is very detrimental to realising the improvement, because right after the measurement, you make a comparison to see if it's better than the other guy or if it's achieved your goal. usually that comparison (logic) slows you way way down and disallows the improvement for the same reasons.

however, I have found a way to continually realise improvement even when measuring myself so often. how is that? it's a secret :) lol, not really. it's actually quite obvious. I watch the stars for such selfish reasons, that the measurement does not get in the way of my improvement. if I come up short, it remains in my mind as something that is constantly improving, and actually motivates me further by realising that I hadn't actually released as much resistance as I thought I had. the measurement is done without comparison.

this is where I'm going to really shine, because it will look, in appearance, like I'm "working hard" to improve so that when I finally come together with the girls, things will be just how I want them to be. however, I'm telling you now that if I take that standpoint, I will realise slow, if any improvement. instead, I'm doing it because it's what feels best for me. I'm doing it for me.

---

now, I'm going to launch into another tangent... I have noticed that structure people are very concerned with appearance and meaning of things as a result. vera once said to me that she really likes physical people. she likes the performers. the realisers of desire in the physical plane. this is where I think most structure people go a little astray, and I say this from the opposite world. I am an emotional/conceptual person, and so my downside is to always do something for desire. I recognised this early on, and is why I have such a tough time following others' guidance (desire) for me. however, when I was with marcos, I learned that trying to interpret marcos' desire into concept never worked well.

getting off-topic here... his desire harmonised with my own very well and I could conceptualise it quite well, so to convert desire into concept, it was too pure. there were lots of logical, and appearance details that didn't quite fit. desire into concept is always too open ended. it needs to go through a reduction stage first. I really like marcos because he really transmitted a lot of that to me non-verbally.

anyway.. where was I? oh yes, structure (logic) connects with emotion or concept. when you do something measuring for the evidencial data, you always slow yourself way-way down. that's why competitors really have a difficult time achieving their goals. if they would instead of looking at the measurement of it, focus on how it feels (conceptually), they would realise much more success. success, after all, is just a feeling anyway. we often times need certain metas or data or achievments to allow ourselves to feel good, but that really is going the hard way. your natural tendency already is to go toward what feels good.

so when vera said she likes the physical guys to me, it really stuck in my mind because I knew that desire meets physicality and structure meets concept.. anyway, now looking back with two years perspective, I can confidently say that focus on physical details will slow a structured person way way down, but speed a desire person up. likewise focus on desire for a conceptual person, slows them way-way down, yet focus on structure and logic speeds them up. that's why I realised such pleasure doing things with marcos when we weren't interacting on a desire level.

I used to be both a desire and a conceptual person in one, which is why things were always so open ended and got slowed way way down. now, being a predominantly conceptual person with my desire side nearly completely deactivated, I can focus on my antithesis, becoming a structure person. you will see me begin to emulate all of these structure-type things, but from a conceptual/emotional perspective. much like a desire person learns to focus in a physical way, and the key to it is controlling emotion (read tesla's autobiography to understand), I am an emotional person learning to focus in a structured way, and the key to it is controlling desire.

### 2018-09-10 01:18 - followup

first, it must be very difficult for these guys to take something that I wrote, like the previous entry and put it into digestible bites for people to consume. likely, they have to take excerpts from the content and just put those there. that has the potentiality to be taken wildly out of context. usually, most things we communicate is spotty at best, anyway. however, trying to reduce something like the previous entry into a 30s-1m blurb would lose in my opinion many of the connections between the points. imagine that you take what I wrote and you simplify it down to 6 points, with 5 transitions between each of them. there isn't a way to really communicate 6 points in a minute effectively. that's about 10s per point, and if you want to include the transitions, it's about 5 seconds per thing.

typically, what I have noticed people on youtube do is to communicate this information visually. take a vox video for example. if those were just bullet points and text, there would be very little engagement. what people are doing is beginning to find ways to communicate those ideas in a visual format for two reasons: 1. the visual format holds the viewer's attention for much longer than text or narration does and 2. it communicates the same amount of information more rapidly.

for example, if I want to show how growth over time, a graph communicates far more than saying 10% growth in the last 6 months. it also can communicate the bigger picture as well. the narrator can say the 10% in the last 6 months, but the graph can easily show the last 24 months with the last 6 highlighted, thereby giving even more assurance of its quality and believability to the data.

so naturally, one of the reasons why I want to gain control of my visual capacity is I am sure I could find a way of communicating some of these very complicated ideas in a much simpler fashion. I don't know how it all works, but I imagine that it's just like any other skill, where it gets better over time. you guys may be able to see things in my left eye as I write out some of these concepts, but it is unlikely that it is actually communicating anything useful. it would be much better if I allowed my ability to communicate my ideas to improve over time, instead of holding that capability in an raw untrained expression.

---

one of the things that had a bit of a reaction was me saying that I have took some things out of the hardasses' playbook. perhaps it got interpreted to mean that I would be delaying things on purpose as long as possible. I didn't mean it that way, though there is a high probability something like that will happen. let me explain.

I am primarily an emotional person now, in the sense that vallecas was the last time that I let someone else's guidance (desire) direct me. since then, I have increasingly become directed by my emotion. this is good. emotion is a funny thing though, because if you're a structural person emotion can be the best sense of guidance you can ever find, as long as you know the origin of the emotion.

when I feel strong desire from someone, it manifests in my body as an emotion. I can "feel" their desire for me to do something. sometimes it even manifests physically too (especially with girls), so it is tangible.. there is another thing that we often feel, which is what we call peer pressure. this is especially strong when you are younger because it feels so real. this is similar to the last one is your perception of what others will think of you, and this happens more often to adults. it's a learned behaviour that occurs in the socialisation process.

these can affect how you feel, and they are emotions that are outside of oneself, to it's easy to recognise them as outside of oneself, which is why we label them things like peer pressure... etc.

however, there is a truly crippling one that we do not usually recognise as external, and that is based on its appearance. it seems illogical that something that appears out of place can make you feel something so strongly. let me illustrate with a few examples.

imagine you have to present something to a group of people, similar to how I am trying to write out this example. if I give any attention to how they may perceive what I am going to say, then I literally paralyse myself with my own resistance around my beliefs of their perception. it is in fact my own perception of their perception of me (how I appear to them, let's say) that can make me feel bad. in light doses of my analysis of their perception, I take the energy out of my own words. after all, I'm not selling the concept; I'm selling myself. eg. I'm making myself look as believable as possible to them, and then by association, the idea also gets sold.

in stronger doses of trying to conform my presentation to be most compatible with their perception, I am actually tuning into their form of thinking, which is exactly where my idea is impacting. it may seem like a camouflaged idea will be better received, but actually this is similar to what I was explaining in my capricornian concept. the impact of the idea simplifies the chaos, and reduces the number of moving parts, to allow for easier reception.

[sidenote: I am by nature a chaotic person. I flourish in diversity (chaos), and really love it when there is more, so what I'm beginning to communicate here may seem a bit opposite of my personality. you have to just go with it though as I'm making my transition into gaining a structured expression as well...]

so, when trying to figure out how to camouflage the idea, someone can spend a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to make an idea best received, and in doing so, the idea loses its power and it causes negative emotion in the perceiver of its reception.

the reason why the perceiver of its reception experiences negative emotion is usually not because the idea itself is bad, but because their perception of its receptivity is bad. if you see some beautiful flowers and you say to yourself, "I'm going to buy these for my girlfriend" and that doesn't feel bad, but then you think to yourself, "I wonder if she'll like them." or "I wonder if she'll think that I'm trying to make up for something I did wrong" -- and you feel negative emotion, or all of a sudden you can't figure out which flowers you want to buy her... it's very likely that your paralysis to purchase the flowers was not because it's inappropriate to buy the flowers. instead, when you introduced your perception of her reception of them, that was the source of the negative emotion and what caused the paralysis.

so, when I say that, I am meaning to say that I will be working toward things feeling right, not toward things "looking right" -- and as a result, they will also look right. I have learned enough now to know that getting things to look right so that I can feel right is very much the difficult way of going about it.

I watched a segment on seth meyers @[youtube](wh3c7-uVnwQ), which really got me thinking. stephanie ruhle mentions that the economy under trump isn't necessarily performing markedly better; he's just selling it better. that caught my attention. also, abraham is constantly doing quite a sales job for things like meditation and stuff like that too. there seems to be an advantage to "selling" something, and I want to figure it out. I think I've begun to see the light on how to do that. it involves reduction and culling the crap to allow the idea shine on its own... anyway... the point is, I will know by how it feels, not by how it appears (I perceive it to be received). meaning, the idea will be as undiluted as possible, and LOA will do the work. it just needs to feel good to me -- and in feeling good to me, I'm selling myself, and then by association, the idea sells itself. something like that.

### 2018-09-10 13:42 - back to school daze

had a few dreams last night trying to convince me of the value the relationship with the girls will bring. you don't need to convince me. I am already sold on the relationship. it was also notable to me how without resistance I felt. it just sort of felt like a natural transition into that happening. nice. I guess I don't have resistance toward the relationship.

then near the end of the sequence, some stuff relating to school started coming up. again I felt no real resistance to the school thing. didn't really bother me. however, as I started to become more awake I felt a growing pressure to make action before they have to begin school. I feel no need to make any action here either. really, it's not a problem. just consider it as gaining more clarity about what you do want.

as best as I can tell, there are a lot of people wanting this thing to go through. probably there is money involved. I'm sure that these guys probably thought it was a good idea to get people needing the manifestation because of lack based thinking revolving around money. besides that, I know that there are opposing forces inside of the company which do not want this thing to go through, and the reason why I know that is because it would have already gone through. if there were not strong thinkers with opposing beliefs, I would not have have any problem coming into alignment with myself and my vision. there is resistance somewhere.

it's probably the guy carlene was talking about. he's not going to change, and I agree, he probably won't. he doesn't need to change for me to find my alignment either. I need to change in order to find my alignment. that's it. that's all there is to it.

there's nothing to be done. I know we're all waiting on me to find my alignment so we can get this show on the road, but really we're just going to have to accept the school as part of the clarifying experience along the way. there's no way around it.

let's take my teeth for example. one of the things that's I feel like I want to really move forward on is my teeth. I want to get them fixed, and I want the implants. I've heard that they take a year to fuse with the bone, so it's going to be the time it takes for them to fuse with the bone, plus the time it takes me to raise the money to get them done.

there is maybe a fast track though, because I know that jesus had the visual capability that I'm looking for, and he could easily look at someone and see them as whole, and then reality had to conform to his perception of the now whole person. I figure I could do something similar with my teeth. you say that's crazy talk, and I like your style, because I'm all about proving that everything you desire is possible as soon as you can line up with it.

I learned about this last night. all your have to do is set your receiver to be in alignment with the manifestation that you want, and it's yours. it works :)

so, let's just chill out and do a little step 5 practicing with me as we get so good at coming into alignment with what we want, all things can then manifest quicker and easier.

if you don't want to go to school, don't go! in every case, this is an exercise in finding what you want and moving toward that. so, don't not go to school. find something you want to do, and do that instead of school. move only in the direction of what is wanted, and pay as little attention to what you do not want.

if you have strong desire to do something instead of school, it will become reality. you don't need to even make it so defined. you don't need to figure out exactly what it is you want to do. find the feeling place of it. for example, I want to be stimulated by interesting ideas around technology, or even more general: I want to feel productive and creative in some crafts that I can do. I want to learn new things. stuff like that.

that may be even a little bit too defined for even people like me. personally, I just hone in what I would feel and practice that. for example, I used to play a computer game called total annihilation. in the game you build up your base with robots. the game had a specific productive feeling to it as I watched my base expand and I felt the sureity of my conquering of my opponent. I really liked how that felt. I also really thought it was so annoying that so much micromanagement had to be done, and I really wanted to learn how to program something that would help me to play the game better, taking off a lot of the burdensome mundane tasks like expanding energy and metal production as excess resources became available or building bigger reserves for them.

actually one of the first things I programmed was a program designed to help me play bingo. it read the screen and pattern matched to find out what was happening so it could play the game for me. I realised that making a full blown TA helper program was very much out of the scope of my capabilities at the time so I shelved the project. later that feeling turned into one where I wanted to do the same to make a digital helper to make a lot of the mundane programming tasks more efficient.

my point is, you can use any feeling that makes you feel good. figure out what it is about the feeling that makes you feel good, and practice feeling that (without playing the game or whatever), and reality will help you find a way toward feeling that feeling more often. if you spend time thinking about school and how you want to do something else, you will find yourself spending a lot more time being required to do something you don't want to do, and wanting to do something else.

figure out what it is you do want to do, and only give your attention to that. you can take my visual capacity as an example for how to do it. if you give your undivided attention to what you want feels like, you will get it.

### 2018-09-12 06:27 - I don't think you're speaking to me in my dream-state

I think it's similar to how you're not speaking to esther when you're speaking to abraham. the same way that abraham operates esther's body is likely how they operate mine in dream-state. the guy you're speaking to sounds exactly like me, uses my expressions, and everything, but he is not me.

you can see how this is likely true when you analyse the function of the brain which translates the concept (block of thought) into words. very often, I'll think a thought, then there's something inside of me trying to get me to translate it into words. as this has increased over time, I've just begun to think almost entirely in words or out loud in voice. I normally don't think in words. words are how I think slowly. the frustration I feel regarding this topic is another discussion, and one of the main reasons why I want to disconnect from the network so bad. I'm tired of being forced to think slowly.

the other day, I was asking mom about her television program, chuck. she said something about how the cia are using his brain and stuff.. I told her that I think that they have completely hijacked my right-hemisphere, because it seems obvious to me. yesterday though, I began thinking of some of the implications. it is quite likely that, just how abraham is able to move esther's body, they are also able to move mine. I notice that they make my muscles spasm when they don't like something I'm doing or I'm seeing images, so muscle movement they already do. however, is it capable of fluid movement?

if they're able to take consciousness from me (or hold me in an unconsciousness state like a sleep-walker), perhaps one of the reasons why they're so super-cool with all of this craziness is because then they could take turns operating my body and having sex with the different girls.

### 2018-09-13 06:33 - when you take away my ability to control myself, I lose self-control

really it is like that. when I am no longer capable of controlling myself. when someone else says, "I don't want you to be able to control you; I want to control you" -- that's when I sorta lose my own self-control, trying any thing possible to regain control. have to be smart about it though.

had a bit of a rough time tonight watching stars. I really got frustrated with the new device in the nose, and stuff. unlike esther couldn't handle pushing against in the form of criticism, I can't handle pushing against in the form of physical limitation. like her, I too know that one day it will be possible that others will try and limit me physically, and I'll just say, "that's nice of them to focus their attention toward me" and I won't need to push back or anything.

I'm not quite there yet. I thought I arrived a few days ago actually to the conclusion that they can add as many devices as they want, cause I'm going to still find my alignment anyway. seems I somehow forgot that temporarily. it's a good thing I was able to get back to remembering that.

I liked the imagery of the last matrix movie where the agents are becoming more and more. at first neo fights them until they become too many to fight. so then as smith tries to take over neo, he consumes smith and conquers him and starts to fly...

cept that's not what happened. I just looked it up. I mixed three scenes from the three movies. in the first one, after dying, trinity saves him with love, then neo flys into smith and causes him to explode: @[youtube](WNnGXXlPzuo) then, so here's the fight scene where there are more and more and more smiths and he flys away: @[youtube](1HdeI-lu3e8) finally, in the final fight of the trilogy, this is where he consumes smith: @[youtube](UrQjHYFChns). (he first is shown flying, besides into smith in the final scene of the first movie @[youtube](Yx12Wy875E4))

I wish I hadn't of looked it up now cause it totally wrecked it for me. I perceived originally that they would try and put more and more devices, (like in the first fight scene where more and more smiths), but fighting so many of them would become impossible and they would eventually pin him down, and then as they tried to take control of him with the black inky stuff. the virus or whatever would overtake him, then, conquering the virus internally he would learn to fly away... I guess I sort of make things up in my mind... the movie version is way worse and super hokey.. lol

the idea for me was that conquering the "virus" internally, means conquering it externally

other things:
- a potential future regarding a new switch in consciousness
- regulation "solutions"
- my dream where I was running then floating

### 2018-09-13 14:15 - I love hurricane season

... cause it means I get clearer nights to watch stars. in fact, there is a direct correlation between florence and clear night skies. meaning, as soon as florence was considerable, I no longer had clouds appear as soon as the sun was going down.

few things I didn't think to check. I often watch the GOES-east southern rockies sector, but there may have been a correlation between cloud creation two nights ago (on the 10th), and strengthening of florence during that same time. I remember that it was the usual increase in cloudiness right after the sun was set, then it abruptly stopped. I thought that it was a bit weird and didn't look so much into it, but it's possible there is a correlation.

if there is a correlation, and I believe there is after seeing similar correlations last year with most notably the houston hurricane that pretty much just stayed in one spot for days, means that their attempts to control the climate to prevent me from watching stars could be cost us 100s of billions of dollars in damages... just to make it less likely I can see images. I feel so special :)

let me repeat: I am not causing those damages. likely those damages are as a result to a storm intensified by their attempts to control the visibility of my night skies. mind blowing. for reals.

well, I'll enjoy my clear night skies for as long as I have them! thanks florence!

### 2018-09-13 14:36 - a possible solution to florence

it may be too late now to get clear night skies, but if 10-100 people went out and watched stars in north carolina, it would create an enormous "high pressure" hurricane shield bubble, and the storm would never make landfall as it continued up the coast. when these guys don't alter the climate, watching stars seems to make the skies more conductive, and makes for higher pressure too as the increased conductivity allows for more heat (yet to be tested theory: I think the increased heat comes from the earth, not from the sun).

---

there might be clear skies on the appalachian mountains. if you watch stars there, it will push the clear skies down toward the coast. other note: I think what is happening is an intensification in the toroidal field that surrounds a person and allows them to see in 3d. I think the stars excite this field allowing higher vibration in this field while at the same time stimulating dmt production, allowing you to see more detail in 3d and making it possible to create objects in 3d space with your imagination. this intensification of the field surrounding the person is what makes the air more conductive and clears away the clouds. obviously the effect the person has on his environment is proportional to that field size. when I first started out, I noticed it was maybe 100m further in the distance. now I can't see the end of it, and it appears my effect on the clouds by looking at the goes imagery to be more than 50km in diameter.

all you need to make the difference, are a few 3d seers to spend a few nights in the moutains with the stars

---

lastly, no matter what anybody tells you, the device does not jeopardise your ability to watch stars. the truth of the matter is, I am *always* having my own experience. meaning, there is always an image being transmitted into my eyes. so, the idea that the device can harm you if it's creating images in your eyes at the same time as you watching stars, is 100% false. I am proof. secondly, even if that were the case, they could easily disable it when you're looking at a star. if they have the technology to know what you're looking at, they can easily determine if it's a star. meaning, it's something they could easily make possible but do not want to. clearly, they do not want you to watch stars -- and I assure you there is no danger to having them put an image in your eye at the same time as you watch a star.

the only case I can come up with is, for a lot of people, they may need to force your brain to produce dmt to see someone like my experience cause it's at a higher detail level, so they need your brain to be able to perceive at higher frequencies (dmt), so when activating my experience for example, your brain produces a lot of dmt to see the experience, combined with the star's excitation of the same function to create more dmt, you may potentially have a remarkably mind blowing experience.

my experience is the opposite. when I watch stars, they activate the part of the brain that removes the dmt. so if my brain is a bathtub, the star is kind of like a big hose, and their machine is kind of like a big drain. meaning, again, they have the capability if regulating your dmt levels while watching stars, but simply do not want to.

the worst that can happen to you is, you have an ayahuasca-like experience for free. when I first started out, that's what the effect was like (without some of the craziness that comes along with the plant consciousness)

### 2018-09-14 07:19 - wack eyesight

if you notice that I'm typically looking to the side, above or below the star now when I watch stars, I noticed it too. in my eyes though, it looks like I'm looking directly at the star, but I'm not really looking at it. the image they put in my eye is not exactly looking any more directly at what I'm looking at. typically, it's shifted to the right a bit, now. as I figured it out, I realised that's why I have such low peripheral vision now. in the last few weeks I've noticed a reduction in my peripheral vision, and it's obvious why now.. if you shift a square image to the left, there's a blank spot on the right side. if you shift your eyesight to the left, since it's a parabolic shape (think circular concave mirror), you need to take some space off around the edges, so you make the mirror more concave, so things look further away, then you twist it a bit, so that what appears in the middle of the eye is really slightly to the left, then you chop off the edges. what you get is a lesser quality version of the image which everything appears further away, and you're not really looking at what's in the center of the picture, which is exactly how things look recently.

wow, the lengths they go to to try and prevent me from advancing with the stars... anyway, I've begun to figure out how to detect where the star really is. I'll be honest, it's a bit weird looking at what appears to be empty sky, but feeling like the star is really there, and seeing the star just to the left of where I'm looking light up like it should...

won't stop me from progressing though. when they're finally done dicking around, I'm going to enjoy a small break seeing properly through my eyes so I can have a real star watching experience again, THEN we can do the girls thing... I realise that'll probably never happen, just like the idea of getting to leave the network. they will likely try to hold me hostage for the rest of my life. oh well.

that's why I say it's probably never going to happen. it's just too risky for them to give me such a public position, when we're in direct disagreement on so many different things. it's just easier for them to hold me hostage and settle for just having access to my dream-state (and a network filled with other people they can try to control).

### 2018-09-14 12:25 - what all that means (again)

I really want to find my alignment before I begin this thing with the girls. that means physically, I want to feel the agility, stamina, and strength I am accustomed to feeling. that means visually, where I actually see what my eyes are seeing and have access to my visual capacity. that means sensationally, where I actually feel the things they way they are supposed to be felt. I want to have a good experience at it. you can understand, hopefully.

they have some silly rules which state that I cannot have my own experience the way I am actually having it, and not only that, the public agrees that they are rightful and able to take that away from me.

that's cool. I'm going to continue to look for my own alignment while you guys sort that out. we are incompatible, and they are not going to change their silly position on that either. as illogical as their position is, there is no real way to affect any change (in them). the only way forward is for me to find my own alignment with myself even when the conditions are not conducive for me to finding it.

I am convinced that I can find it though, and they are sure that they can just keep making it more difficult for me. every time I get closer, they try to undo that progress or make further progess more difficult. I suppose it's like some really long winded sparring match. it is quite possible that I will never be able to achieve it in my current state (refusing to meditate or engage in any physical activity). in the past I have never needed to engage in physical activity to find my alignment -- and actually, when I did have that energy flowing, I can't just sit around. I have so much excess energy, there is no way I could be stationary. it often means long hours working on something, or lot's of physical exercise.

I will eventually begin meditating again, however I find it mostly frustrating at the moment. recently, I have not bee able to quiet anything in my mind. it's as if they have something in my head that keeps putting stuff in my head all day, and my failed attempts to meditate is where I first begun the idea that my right-hemisphere is being used for something else, which I am not aware of physically, just feel and sometimes it inspires thought.

the best way I can try to reason about what may be happening is, they're using the imagination in my right-hemisphere constantly and, even though I don't see it in my left eye, that's why it's so blurry, because it's not focused to see the darkened picture my imagination is producing in my eye. instead, I'm focused to see the image they are putting in my eye. that explanation certainly would explain why they do not want me seeing images and why my imagination doesn't work. obviously if I'm seeing images, they're not going to be able to use my imagination at the same time. instead, they will see my images, not theirs. they probably don't want that.

I come from the perspective that I can obtain anything I put my mind to, and I want my visual capacity. they believe they can just hijack that part of my head as their own, then hold me a prisoner for the rest of my life. you could say, well kenny, why don't you just accept that you can't use your visual capacity and just enjoy your coming life experience. yeah, I'm not that kind of person. I have to be continually moving toward what I want. you will see that I will find a way of coming into alignment with who I really am, and then reality has to conform and come into alignment with that too.

so you say, why don't you work out a deal with them where they can use your visual capacity during the night and you have access during the day. I tried. that's the proposal I gave to stacie when I was at vanguard. it didn't work. they are sure they want 24/7 access to my imagination, apparently.

so, like I said, that's fine with me. I've grown accustomed to it, and I new perceive it as a competition (spirit of elijah) now, which I am sure I will "win" (eventually). I'm not saying this thing is never going to happen, but it probably won't be happening any time soon.

they see it as a threat to their setup of using my brain to do their stuff, so it's inconceivable for them to relinquish me the use of my own brain, because it means they would lose their main source of visual creativity. I see it as inconceivable that I would attempt to engage in such a large scale operation just kinda "winging it" out of control and out of alignment. I am better than that, and I just won't do it.

when I was young, I would not walk until I knew that I could make it. consider it risk management if you want, but I guess I plowed into enough coffee tables and my dad probably made fun of me enough about hurting the coffee table, to know that when I attempted to walk I wanted to do it well. that meant that I did not walk until much later than an infant usually walks, but when I finally attempted the walk, I did it well. same thing is occurring here: I'm going to wait until I'm sure I can walk well, in order to ensure that I avoid any more coffee table encounters.

you say, what about the "art of the mistake" that you were talking about so much. a mistake is missing a turn; a mistake is not a head-on collision with a tree at 100mph. that's an accident. this isn't "the art of the accident"

### 2018-09-14 13:48 - why does it have to be like this?

if you think about how the other timelines went, you could see that in a situation where all of a sudden I have other people summoning large quantities of energy from me sexually, you would expect that to create huge desire for me to allow that kind of energy to flow through me again. so, it would. the desire produced by the sexual summoning would require that kind of alignment from me, and since it is what I already want, it would be a nearly instant manifestation. there would be nothing that anyone could do to prevent it. I'm sure they tried fruitlessly in the other timelines, realising they would be forced to scramble and find a different host for their visual creativity.

certainly if I just went with the girls now that would work, and I believe it is how I believe it happened in all of the other timelines. this timeline is different though, as it seems I want the satisfaction of finding that alignment myself, and not needing the excuse of someone(s) else's summoning of desire to make that happen. the evidence of difficulty getting this manifestation to happen suggests that there are greater intentions of not needing someone else to find one's own alignment.. so likely, it is quite possible that even the girls have the intention to find their own alignment too, not needing me to be the reason for it.

mostly I think it gives the bso more time to use my visual capacity and an early warning to begin finding their own alignment, or start looking for a new host. I would love to see all of the world have this capability too, but something tells me the bso has had enough coffee table experiences with visually capable people like me, that they will likely want to ensure that no one else gets an uncontrollable (by them) visual capacity ever again. and, who knows.. instead of trying to vicariously use mine, they may actually learn more by observing me mine. eg. there's no way a dancing puppet can ever dance better than a real dancer can, especially if the puppeteer has never even seen a real dancer dance.

### 2018-09-16 02:35 - I love futurepop/ebm

sometimes there are songs that seem to capture so well different things that I experience in my life. I just began to notice something I have not noticed before. neuroticfish is german. in one of their songs, "waste", he says, "I can't stand your decency" -- which is something I had always interpreted it as "not-nakedness" or "not-offensiveness", but then when I looked it up, he probably used decency in the form of conformity, as defined by the dictionary: "behavior that conforms to accepted standards of morality or respectability"

wow. I never thought about it as conformity. suddenly the song has a whole new meaning for me. it very accurately conveys an emotion I often have felt regarding my role here in the bso shell game. I'm brilliant. I have a truly magnificent mind, and they want to just completely waste it. previously I believed that there is so much that can be gained, but it's as if they do not want to take advantage of the incredible technology that they have available to them.

however, as time goes on, I realise that they are using a good portion of it, but its use is secret because they want to maintain their top-dogness. if this technology gets public acceptance and understanding, then they won't have an advantage any more. they playing field will be levelled and and the plebs will have access to the same technology that they have.

so, in the end what I learned from the song is that it's actually the conformity that allows people to just accept such a vapid reality, where people are seem to be satisfied with a lightweight future were you only mind the perception of others as the measurement of yourself. I cannot handle this. I must have constant expansion. I cannot settle for that.

I can't stand your decency
I guess you are wasting me

---

I really like the depth to which the words of nuroticfish speaks. it excites the pure desire type being inside of me that speaks in principals and infinitives. the best example of this is "Darkness/Influence" (it just came on as I wrote that!)

```lyrics
You are the slaves of the modern ages
Raised to be patient and to agree
You're only able to turn the pages
But you have forgotten how to read

You are dancing to the sound of deception
A product that we have designed
You are dancing to the sound of deception

You are dancing, awaiting solutions
Reflecting what we left behind
You are dancing to the sound of deception

You are deceived by the modern ages
You throw away your dignity
You are a part of different stages
Simplified by productivity

You are dancing to the sound of deception
A product that we have designed
You are dancing to the sound of deception

You are dancing, awaiting solutions
Reflecting what we left behind
You are dancing to the sound of deception

You are dancing to the sound of perfection
The moments that we have combined
You are dancing to the sound of perfection

You are dancing, awaiting solutions
In doses that we have defined
You are dancing to the sound of deception
```

however, today I remembered the song, "you haven't earned it" by assemblage 23, probably because last night I was listening to @[abe](2004-05-01) workshop where abraham talks about "earning". nowadays, they use the expression, "hard work and sacrifice" to convey the same thing. they said:

«earning doesn't feel very good. earning sounds like somebody else holds the strings. somebody else gets to decide whether I have jumped through the hoops in the right way»

which got me thinking about that. then, today I was thinking about how mom felt when she came home today, thinking about how they are convinced that if I could just do something differently, they could feel good. they have this perception that the governmental entity or the rules are not going to change, and so therefore I am holding them in a place of discomfort because I won't conform to the unchanging (impossible to change) rule. well, the same thing I could say about them. to me it's absolute silliness that the public is in agreement that they can hold my body energetically in a state of such disallowance to the very thing that I discovered. I find it absolutely appalling that the public just sits and watches as they rob me of my discoveries, like they are allowed to literally do whatever they want to a person and then lie about it.

in a very symbolic world, you can imagine it like this. in any relationship, if one of the persons requires the other person to do what they want and does not allow them the freedom to choose what it is they want, we call that rape. imagine though that you were a witness to someone getting raped, and you didn't say anything about it.

ok, so they're not exactly forcing me to do what they want. that would obviously be pretty bad. but it would be somewhere akin to sexual harassment, where the woman is usually confined into a space where the man makes unwanted advances on her. they're not exactly forcing me to do anything, but they're making it really difficult for me to go anywhere else. it's sort of like the guy who presents himself so often to the girl that she finally agrees to go with him on a date just to get him to stop harassing her. true love :)

well, if you were witness to a dude doing that repeatedly over the course of a few years span of time and you continued to let it happen, as he uses his position of power to ensure that she does not advance in her job until he does the necessary favours that he requires for her to advance. if you witnessed that and did not say or do anything about it, you'd be a shithead. I hear at the bso they have a very strong stance against that kind of thing. I feel like if I were maybe a girl, I could tell them that I have these really horrible people that are harassing me, lol anyway...

wow, what a detour. so then the song is going on in my head about how I have not earned it. at first I thought maybe the song would be like what the guys running my head would be saying to me, but then when I heard the part where he says, "you haven't walked long enough in these shoes", I realised that I was in fact singing the song to the guys stealing my discoveries from me.. you haven't earned it.

I began to realise how much I enjoy the emotional perspective that assemblage 23 has to offer. my first memories of listening to both of these songs, I was working on a new social network written in D while sitting in a cast in a small apartment in bilbao living with my mom. I was just beginning to get my job taken away from me by erik. it was right after the accident. I interpreted these same songs as my message to zaryn, having to put up with so much of his bullshit.

crazy how things are so much of a resonance of each other in my life. I am once again living with my mom disillusioned with a large project I initiated, yet our differences of motivations have created the perception conveyed in "waste" and my emotional reaction is the one of "you haven't earned it" as we begin to move apart. "I guess you're wasting me" ... "enjoy the need of all the thirsty minds awaiting light to see"

so, put yourself back in the workplace harassment scenario where the guy is holding the woman away from her promotion because he thinks she has not yet earned it by performing the necessary sexual favours for him to consider her "worthy" enough of her promotion.

in this metaphor, I am the woman in and the bso is the sleazy guy, so the "you haven't earned it" song for me is a pivotal moment where I get to say to them that they haven't earned my visual capacity. they have not lived the life I have lived which caused me to want it. they did not go through the necessary task of releasing resistance to achieve that high of a frequency to be able to allow something like that. they have not earned it, but I cannot do anything about that really. though, what I can say to them is, you may believe I have not yet earned the promotion because I have not given you the sexual favours you desire, but you have not earned my favours either. so step the fuck off and "enjoy the *need* of all the thirsty minds awaiting light to see"

### 2018-09-16 06:51 - a more practical example

I have realised the difficulty with the example of the workplace harassment and withholding of the promotion for sexual favours. instead, let's imagine something more practical.

imagine a guy who makes cocaine. he makes it for his own usage. the police come and take his cocaine from him telling him it is against the law to sell cocaine. so the cops take it and sell it to people at a controlled price. there is no way for him to get justice because who's he going to tell -- the police? so, since he's not breaking the law (the coke he's making is for personal consumption and has no intention of selling it) he decides to just make more. they come and take it again.

this escalates until the police are literally coming all the time to confiscate his coke. he is without options, because there's no way to escape the cops oppression. so, he just decides to make more coke. the more time he spends making coke, the more time he has to enjoy a few lines while making it. escalating further, now every time he finishes production they come to take it. it's official, he can only enjoy his coke while he's making it. he's a coke making machine now.

he keeps finding more ways to make more coke. trying to figure out how he can finally enjoy his own coke, he hears a rumour that the cops also want him to blow the entire police force. he hopes maybe if he does they will take less of his coke as thanks, and finally he can enjoy more of his coke. the police won't talk to him. they just take his coke and leave, so he asks the people buying his coke from the cops, and obviously no one can confirm or deny this rumour. coke? what's that?!?

the cops probably don't to be found out.. maybe they don't want to reveal to their buyers their plan to coerce him into sexual favours as well.. maybe they do they want to reveal that they've selling stolen coke to their buyers.. maybe they don't want their buyers to know how to make their own coke.. obviously though, the cops have no intention of ever taking less coke from him. they definitely don't want their coke provider to be enjoying so much he's all coked out and unable to produce as much as he is right now.

it doesn't matter really what the reason is, the cops clearly have no intention to stop stealing his coke (sales are pretty high! they've got a billion "users" now), or to actually have a conversation with him to work out a deal or confirm that they really want sexual favours too. they want him to offer his sexual favours on the hope that he can catch a break from them.

it's clear this is an impossible situation, so he just settles into the optimising his production technique, which makes it possible for him to get a little higher every production even also produce more every time. why make coke at all? to him, a few lines during production is still better than no coke at all -- and, he's getting REALLY GOOD at making coke.

one day, he hopes to find a way to actually do his own coke distribution. maybe, if he can learn better distribution, provide a purer product, and make it all free (cause the rule is you can't sell it), he'll hopefully have more to enjoy for himself. it's a pretty lofty dream. for now though, he's decided to just get better making his product: more purity and more production efficiency.

it sounds pretty crazy that his goal is to give away his coke for free, but in his perspective, he's already giving his coke away for free, anyway. he's not going to force anyone to take his free coke, he's just doing it for his own pleasure. he didn't optimise his production and quality so that cops can just take his pristine product, dilute the fuck out of it and sell it to naïve people. giving away a higher quality product feels like the right way for him. even just the idea of making people an undiluted product that they can receive more benefit from, makes him feel better than the hopelessness of his present circumstances.

sidenote: I love how the word "users" can be used in the context of both drugs and members. lol

### 2018-09-16 13:53 - step 5 shocks

zehra posted a reply to my comment on her video asking me what emotion I had with the shocks. I decided I'm going to reply here.

I can't think of an exception, so proceeding the shock I am always feeling quite good. in fact, I am feeling so good that is what causes the image to form in my eye. I have always wanted a visual capacity like nikola tesla has, and so to begin translating energy (good feeling) into something visual means I have come into alignment with what I want. usually right after the shock, I often feel negative emotion, which means my inner being perceives the shock differently than I do, which is why I feel the negative emotion. that's why I think it's step 5 practice, because I know what I want (step 1), source answers it (step 2), I find a way of coming into alignment with it (step 3) and begin to see the images. even though I have been shocked in the past, I'm getting quite good at still coming into alignment with what I want that it's normal for me (step 4), and then I get shocked. once I again I know what I don't want (the shocks), so I do know what I want (to translate energy visually), so I'm back in step 1 again and this time I have to find a way of not being mad at myself for attracting the shock (step 5).

so, I believe the shocks are a good thing now. they're just step 5 practice, (or, in last night's analogy, it's when the cops come and confiscate the coke) and I'm really getting used to not letting them really bother me any more. I know that what I want is all queued up for me and ready to go, and all I need to do is to come into alignment with that. my realisation this morning is that likely when I am so practiced at step 5, the shock will no longer bother me and so I will no longer attract the shock, finally achieving mastery of step 5 and also gaining an incredible visual capacity! it sounds good to me, and the idea of coming into alignment with both of these at once is exhilarating to me

### 2018-09-16 14:40 - inspiration of desire

I just had an interesting interaction where I got to show greg how I often times inspire/create desire in others. usually someone will motivate or compel desire. this is how sales work and it's based on communication. however, my reduced capacity to communicate desire (positively) often times leaves me in situations where I inspire desire in others by making them more aware of what they don't want (so they can easier make the jump to know what they do want).

this is precisely what is happening with my interaction with the bso is also doing. my coming into alignment with my visual capacity, they are knowing more and more strongly what they don't want (I assume for one of their users to have an uncontrollable visual capacity), so they know more clearly what they do want (to ensure that everyone's visual capacity is best controlled).

also, for example last night, I had a bit of a reaction to my internal dialogue about kiera knightly and love actually. they realised that in a few seconds on the imdb page, I had managed to notice more information than their machines could detect. I guess it's a whole lot easier to know when I notice boobs, than it is to decipher the intricacies of everything I notice in a single glance. they know what they don't want (to see me capable of performing a mental function that they cannot detect), so they know more clearly what they do want: they want to ensure that they can track everything everyone is doing mentally.

sidenote: I don't really know how they're going to do that because I can often times look at something and I don't see it, but I trained myself like tv series monk to be able to return back and notice details I hadn't before. I attributed the capacity previously to being able to notice and store more than I was able to process, however I understand now that I'm actually tuning back into the memory and extracting an extra detail I hadn't seen before. since my memory isn't visual, this is relatively easy for me to do. it is error prone though, like the one time when I tuned into the memory of derek and saw him with a cast on. the subject of the mistaken detail was the cast: having had one, not wearing one.

---

I believe this conflicting desire will continue to grow where the bso desire to control people will continue to get stronger, and other people like myself who come into alignment with their broader perspective and are able to have an uncontrolled visual experience. the two desires will feed off of one another, both sides fast-tracking the desire of the other side. the secret is step 5 here, because no matter how strong their desire to control is, no one (accept for yourself) can hold you away from your desire. all anyone has to do is to come into alignment with it and you do that by controlling your emotional response, not the circumstances.

### 2018-09-17 23:59 - simplifying the bathtub metaphor

I think I overcomplicated this by trying to use numbers. this also happened when I was explaining a similar concept to aaron and I was able to simplify it by using the girls example. I can't remember it exactly right now, so it must have been a reminder for me to recall that. anyway, let's simplify the bathtub example I expanded on in this @[abe](2004-05-01) notes.

so, let's talk about the well-being in my head (dmt) as a reserve. imagine you need some amount of it to accomplish certain things. it works less like a tank of water and more like a battery, where the fuller it is, the brighter the light will be. I like the battery metaphor even better, because it's it's quite literally a capacitor, and a battery has pretty similar behaviour to a capacitor. if you want to know the differences between a battery and a capacitor, I must refer you to robert murrey smith's videos. that's where I learned the difference. the main difference is the discharge curve, because a capacitor stores energy as "static electricity" and a battery stores the energy chemically. eg. charging a battery restores a chemical imbalance which produces electrons electrons. when the battery is discharged, it is back in balance. the method for storing energy is inconsequential in this example, so consider it as a generic energy storage device, which I'll call a battery :)

anyway... imagine it's necessary to have 10V in your battery to be able to see images in your eyes. that is the "pressure" necessary to turn on the screen in your eyes to see the image. what they do to me, is they keep my battery always on empty.

for this example I will also assume perfect efficiency as well. so, if you have a 1000mA/h battery that is full, you can run a load that consumes 100mA for 10 hours. likewise, it will take 10 hours to charge back to full in 10 hours @ 100mA, or 1hr at 1000mA, or 10 minutes at 10000mA. perfect efficiency :) in reality it is quite a bit different than this, and yields a discharge curve where the voltage drops over time. so, in this case now it's helpful to think of this again like water in a bathtub. I would like to explore the electrical example in a future date, as I think there is something to be learned there, but for now let me explain with the bathtub.

everyone has a quantity of well-being (dmt) in their head which can be used to make images in the eyes. it's directly related to how good you feel, and I believe it can be converted to and from serotonin. the better you feel (serotonin), the more of this well-being (dmt) your brain produces. the more of this dmt you have in your brain, the more you convert what you feel into something visual. that's why things look so incredible. I have such low resistance, I actually see my world through the eyes of how I feel. anyway... for whatever reason, they don't want me to see images in my eyes, so they are putting the image my eyes see at a much lower quality into my eyes, to make sure I run at a lower frequency, and since it's overwriting what I am seeing with my eyes, I don't see any images in my 3d space.

my eyes are kind of a battleground. they are reading what I see with my eyes, converting it to a lower frequency, then forcing my eyes to see that picture. so, then sometimes after I watch stars I can see images in my eyes. when my eyes are closed, I believe they either don't send a picture into my eyes (unlikely) or the emotion I'm conjuring is producing an image in my eyes which has a stronger signal than the one they're sending, which is just black, so it's able to be seen. that's why sometimes I can see images in my eyes while they're closed. when they're open and I get the visual patterns, if they weren't sending an image into my eyes already, I would see pretty colours in my eyes. instead it's being added to the image they're sending into my eyes, so to me, it looks like the air is swirling about and flowing and moving, much like the colours would be, but the colours are erased, and I can only see the very high frequency movement their machines are not yet precise enough to remove.

in short, those events happen when I have a lot of dmt in my head, so they want to try and minimise the amount of dmt I have in my head. they want to make sure my battery is always on empty.

so, that essentially means I don't have a reserve. if I'm always on empty, it means I'm only able to use what I produce in the moment. so, the only times when I can have those visual events are when I'm producing high amounts. this happens when I watch stars and other things. the bso offers my vision in different tiers. some people see similar to how I see. they see a lower quality. I believe I see the lowest quality in my eyes, but what is sent to them is what I *really* see, which has all of the colours and stuff. so, if you want to see what I really see, you'll have to ask for the HD version.

anyway, this idea that I have no reserve is an interesting one, because that means I'm no longer a bathtub, but a pipe. that means I am living really in the moment. one of the implications of not seeing what my eyes really see, is *all* of the low frequency emotion encoded in my vision is removed, so the only emotion that remains is the extremely high frequency emotion that they cannot remove. I guess that's pretty good, if I only feel really high frequency emotion, cause I don't need to worry about any low frequency emotion I feel. you guys see that, not me :)

it really simplified it for me a lot to no longer see it as a reserve, but like a wire. as much trouble as I'm having, it's pretty impressive to me to know that, even living hand-to-mouth energetically, I'm still able to feel pretty good most of the time.

I can't wait to see what my world *really* looks like!

---

it's also kind of funny to me too, that literally no one accept my inner being is having my full experience. as high of quality experience, the top visual tier guys are having, the fact that I'm still able to see the air swirl and move about, tells me that the precision of their technology is still a limiting factor, so not a single person on this earth is actually having the full experience

I also have been thinking about the incompatibilities around this whole thing, and it's kind of funny because it seems that there were a lot of potential futures that passed me by in this process. so, perhaps just like how only my inner being gets to experience my full physical experience, only my inner being got to have those experiences too.

I wonder if that is one of the attracting factors for me to bridge the gap between my non-physical source and this physical experience. since that desire is in fact probably the main contributing reason why there are so many incompatibilities, it's sort of like a problem that created itself as a solution to itself. crazy

### 2018-09-20 09:10 - dream-state interaction with mom

I can't remember the question she asked me, but I insisted on giving her an answer she didn't want to hear. it felt like she tried to interrupt me a few times, but I pushed through and was able to tell her how important the home-schooling was for me. I said something like, "she wasn't expecting ______ from me so I didn't need to prove my smartness to anyone"

I'll ask her for the exact quote in the morning :)

---

this got me thinking a bit, why was the pushing through part so important. I remember what I said may have even been a repeat of something I'd said before. I thought maybe I said it previously in here, but maybe now that I think about it, I think I said it in a previous dream interaction.

anyway, the important part of the interaction was the pushing through part. it felt similar to the other times I pushed through and punched her or whatever. it felt as if the interaction was so undesired I pushed my way through to higher levels of consciousness so I could answer the question correctly. it seems that on these difficult questions I really need to be conscious to be able to give a good answer, and I simply cannot in such an unconscious state.

I presume it would be like trying to make sense of what someone says to you in the middle of a mushroom trip or something. it probably is something that makes a lot of sense to me in the higher state of consciousness, but little sense to normal people in real-life.

I remember I used to have this problem (and it may be the reason why mom's asking the questions) in my life previously when I would give the answer in its pure form for me to understand, but was barely intelligible. for those watching me right now and wanting to know how I improved my answers, I began using my feeling. I had to first detect who I was speaking to, then mix the answer I have with their energy and give it to them. that's why my answer is always different depending on who I'm talking to and the mood they're currently in. then, I needed to be conscious enough to sense when they weren't getting it and to try a new angle. it really helped me to trust my emotional capacity because my conversation was proof to me that I could feel the person, and I could mix the answer's energy with the person's energy before translating it.

---

also, my answers are not wholly unintelligible. they are actually brilliant puzzles. the fun part about them is because they come from a part of me which is really really smart and very very wise, even human kenny finds the answers to be brilliant riddles. the reason why they're riddles, I believe, is because my other self -- the one I really want to get into contact with because he's brilliant -- knows that when I have to think about the answer a bit, it tends to stick with me.

because the answers come from such a higher frequency form of thought, they make tons of sense in that state of mind, but when returning back to everyday-life frequency, they don't make much sense, so just like jesus spoke in parables, I notice the answers he gives are sort of like that. the more thought-provoking, the more memorable they are, the better they are communicated. I use the same exact technique to bring concepts back from drug experiences.

since I usually only get to hear that other side of me though when I do drugs (and it seems like I used to begin to know him in my dream state and also when the stars put me in a heightened state of consciousness), now you can know why I like doing drugs so much. it's essentially cause I want so much to learn to figure out how to communicate with my other self. if I could do all of that without drugs, I would be far less interested with the drugs (that is, until I get bored and *need* to discover something new -- then it's back to the drugs)

---

lastly, esther does the same thing for abraham. you will notice that when abraham speaks, they literally say the same thing over and over. the difference between two people asking similar questions, is each answer is clearly the energy the person (question) summons. abraham speaks in similar principled-like (this is the way it is) manner. that form of speech is how I identify someone speaking from desire. then like me, they go a step further than just speaking unintelligible principal based answer with the questioner's energy, and out comes something truly brilliant that is understandable to the person.

the reason why they record the sessions is because often times the questioner cannot hear the answer until some time has passed. I often times let some time pass and revisit the concept for the same reason.

---

while on the subject, the reason why esther spends so much time tending to how she feels before translating abraham is because someone's mood very definitely alters the translation. you may notice that you put a concept in my head for me to translate and depending on my mood, the same signal gets translated quite a bit differently. this is why I have been harping on the nexus idea for so long. if I have difficulty translating (even feeling the other person) the concept into something the other person can hear in their current mood, it will be very difficult. if the concept is rebroadcast, not the translation, each person can translate it according to their own mood.

the other huge advantage of the nexus system is the replay value to it. ever notice how you don't want to hear the same words again when you relive the experience over and over? if the concepts were transmitted, then the person having the experience would have a slightly different experience every time, because, depending on their current mood (environment, ecosystem), they will understand the same concept slightly different each time, depending on what they've got going on (what they're bringing to the table) before having the experience

---

for reals lastly... these metaphors, riddles or parables are just a vibrational key to get back to the principal at a later time. they serve as a mnemonic to be able to be able to tune back into the pure desire of that concept. you have often wondered how I can read something or see something and glean a whole lot more information out of it than what was said or what was shown. everything that anyone says is a concept, but behind it is the desire (or motive force) behind what they are saying. there is also meaning and logic behind it too, which I'm learning about recently -- but most importantly, the concept can be used to retrieve the original principal. I practiced this with abraham, trying to get past their words and the answer -- trying to grasp the principal behind it. I found out this can be done with anything though and used the same technique to "descodificar" many other things, too :)

good night :P

### 2018-09-20 12:51 - more about waking me up in the dream-state

after this morning, I woke up with a better sense of what is happening. the reason why I felt like it was the same energy as when I punched mom, it's the serious frustration my other self feels and doesn't know what to do. in the case where I punched her in the dream, it aborted the dream, and same last night -- but the reason why michael (the name I will call my other dream-state self) did not resort to violence, is because just like what is happening to me, it doesn't solve anything. they just clamp down tighter.

so, similarly to how I have become in real-life michael has given up hope in the dream-state. it appears that there will be no way for him to find enough action to be able to get his freedom. he's more and more locked into the dreams they want him to be in, and he has to interact with they people they put there. like kenny, he used to enjoy lots of freedom in the dream-state, however, since they're scared he'll fly, and they want to get information out of him, his only environment, the dream-state is very controlled.

he's decided that there's nothing really that can be done. he feels essentially imprisoned as well with no way to change it, so like me he's just going to make the best of the situation, and see if he can't find a way out intellectually. perhaps he could encode his answers and interact in such a way that newfound desire would be born for him to have his freedom.

I didn't really think about it, but I suppose that's how I feel too. I was just reacting logically to things. I did gain that new position after sleeping a lot more I noticed, and thought that maybe someone at the bso ensuring that none of the girls thing going through was behind it, but now that I think about it, it must have been my new personality -- saturn's logical implementation of the strong desire expressed by michael. instead of translating it previously as emotion, it now comes out as logic... wow so cool :) crazy how we're figuring out how to communicate and work as a team even though most (low frequency) communication has been cut off.

anyway, so when powerful frustration builds to such a point, instead of responding violently, now he wakes me up, so I can use my super translation skills to bail him out a bit of the frustration. it's really funny, because the sense I get is like a kid and his parent who's asleep in the other room. if the other kids behave badly enough, he's got to go wake dad up and tell on them, so dad can sort things out... lol, I realise I do have a bit of a repressed kid inside, even though he's 18, it's still kind of funny to me he's resorted to telling on the troublemaker... lol

### 2018-09-21 13:38 - another way to interpret the symbols in the matrix

I think that trinity being a woman is pure convenience for hollywood. if you think about trinity as another aspect of neo, the symbol instead reads that as soon as neo learns to love and believe in himself, he gets super powers. *that* seems much more likely to me. morpheus then represents the thinking and reasoning part of one's mind, and trinity represents the emotional aspect of it. (and cypher represents the lure of the deliciousness of physicality @[youtube](4YbMqcQK0k4) as compelling enough to assist the controllers)

so then what is agent smith? if you think about the way we are headed, you have the bso who is now capable of doing whatever they want in anyone's head. we're stuck in their system and there's no real way (or option) to get out. the planet is a little more open-ended than the matrix though, since it's not 100% virtual reality (yet), so it's still costly to maintain control. once we live in software, control is as good as the programmer's ability to code. until then, they have to physically limit us. that is impractical though as there aren't enough resources to physically limit everyone, so they need to create a set of rules, and compel people to follow their rules, so they can maintain perceptive superiority.

if you look at the main thrust of the events in my life, they have found someone with far greater ability to perceive than their own. for these guys, they are ahead of the curve in technology (we only get the benefit of military's old technology after they've got the newer better version). here's someone (me) who's ahead of them in perceptive capacity, and that capacity comes with huge creative potential as well -- so it's a huge threat. they definitely cannot have people like me out in the world with the ability to use their visual/creative capacity and still maintain their technical superiority. they've got to limit utilisation of this capacity only to people authorised by and subservient to the bso.

so, how do they limit that capacity? or, more importantly the people with that capacity? I postulate it's women. I believe that it is more likely for the men to break the rules and to find a way of coming into alignment with that visual capacity than for women to do so. I don't really know why I believe that, but it feels to me like the bso believes they are a lot better at manipulating the mind of a person who does not believe in theirself (or that needs the approval of others), than the mind of a person capable of loving and believing in himself.

imagine that a woman could reduce the perceptive capacity of the man sexually, which I believe is a thing. I think there is an energy transfer that takes place and each take on a bit of the energy the other person has to offer. imagine that you can convince women that they can obtain this perceptive capability from people sexually. now, the women can disempower themselves believing thier visual capability can be obtained by giving sexual favours to someone else with the capacity. who are the people with this capacity? people working for the bso, and people the bso want to control. so, at the behest of the bso, any woman nearby can transform into an agent smith and try to seduce the guy with this capacity.

you would notice a lot of woman constantly interested in this neo type, trying to get him to focus his energy outwardly, instead of inwardly. in fact, this is the goal of any "social" part of our society nowadays. the more you focus your energy outwardly, the more approval and the more valuable other people can make you feel. however, if you focus your energy inwardly, other people perceive you as valuable, but they don't necessarily approve of you, because of their own jealousy toward your inwardly self-realised value.

### 2018-09-21 18:07 - the bso, LOA and regulation

I have been against regulation of these brain type devices. it's unnecessary friction, and for example, when I make my brain device, I will want to be able to send signals into people's heads and not have that regulated. you can also see for the coming huge game industry that will be built on this type of platform. not only do you want to create hugely immersive environments visually, but you will also want to be able to feel your interaction with that environment as well. for simple things like a love scene, you will want to have a pretty tactile experience with the game characters for it to be immersive. or, if you're out in an environment, you will want to feel the wind, water, sand, humidity, etc. for the coming interactive movie market, you will also want to control the emotions of the user. the more information the provider of the experience has on the viewer, the more immersive the experience can be. for the coming medical applications possible as well, this is most obvious, the more information and the better capability the device has to affect the user, the more effective it is in tracking and mitigating health risks. to me, it is obvious that the same device which can cause considerable harm, can also improve quality of life quite considerably, as well.

so, I am against regulation because it will severely inhibit progress in this area, creating only considerable friction for useful products (instead of just ones designed to control) to be created. the only regulation that I would want is, for the use of this technology to be entirely optional. not only does the entity controlling the device affecting the user's experience have to notify the user of the entity's devices presence, but also they must have the option and ability to be released from the device's influence. if those are not given, you can imagine just by watching computer malware and viruses to know that once any company with significant enough resources to get nanotechnology in someone's body can begin to affect their experience.

obviously the cost of producing this nanotechnology is prohibitively high at the moment and it sounds like they're going to be making sure that no one dethrones them as the company with the tightest grip on human perception. I anticipate that this is the new religion. long amonts of time will pass where the church holds all of the power, prohibiting the followers from even being able to read the documents the church is founded on. some time will pass as we go through the "dark ages" -- cept it won't really be that dark cause a lot of people will be having a lot of fun. then, a guy like gutenburg will make a printing press, allowing for the mass creation of these types of devices, effectively allowing for new "sects" (companies) to begin offering other (and new) flavours of implementation of this technology. the church (bso) will no longer have total control over people's perception and they'll have their older generation-like following and scandal to maintain their presence in the minds of people for a long time.

I imagine that these sort of events will take place over a shorter time-scale, but I guess it depends on how effective they are at keeping this technology out of the hands of everyone, cept for themselves. this is the dark ages and really, all the dark ages are, is a portion of time where those running the church could feel so superior that they begin to get sloppy.

right now it would be difficult for a gutenburg to show up, because they're controlling stuff so tightly right now. instead, time needs to pass as they bask in their superiority and domination for some time. the suppression of human creativity for so long summoned, right after the dark ages, a surge in human creativity, we now call the renaissance.

I'm going to take a break now. when I come back, I want to talk about this specifically in combination with LOA and some of the things I've been learning.

### 2018-09-24 15:29 - a future irony?

wouldn't that be funny if once we got the technology to tune into alternate timelines, and in the timelines where I didn't wait long enough for the head hardass to actually come enough into alignment with himself, he actually drops dead because of the incompatible vibrations.

I'm kind of mixing two different things here, and I find it unlikely, but I just wanted to write it down for some strange reason. I have so many experiments I want to make when I get the alternate timeline capability. like, what would really have happened if I did something horrible, or what would really have happened if I had of got access to weed, or whatever..

the reason why I say is because it feels like I'm so close to getting my visual capacity, it should not be an issue. I really believe that I have come into alignment with it more than enough times now, that there has to be something else holding it up.

what I mean is, probably my visual capacity is more like the green light for this whole thing. once everything is all ready and in place, then it'll come, I'll feel good, and feel ready, and be ready.

so, that's what I'm saying... there are some things I'm beginning to optimise even now, but what if the main desire holding this up is not all my own. in the @[abe](2004-05-01) workshop, abraham says, «that's the hard part about co-creating. when you co-create with others sometimes -- every time you co-create with someone else, the things they want get vibrationally factored in».

so that's kinda where this idea comes from. what if all of this is an enormous irony where what appears to be unwanted, is actually quite wanted. however, until much later (probably when it's able to be heard more easily), this (and probably other) great ironies can be realised.

I woke up this morning with a strong sense, that we're working so hard against LOA to go in one direction, when it's actually the "failure" was actually the better way. I woke up with a sense of irony.

### 2018-09-24 15:58 - the bso, LOA and regulation (part two)

in my previous @[entry](2018-09-21 18:07) entry, I wanted to go a whole different direction than I actually went with it. I had a few reactions, and I thought maybe we could go down the direction I really wanted to go as well.

##### how the gutenburg printing press idea could come about

this is entirely speculation, but the way the device works is, it's resonant to a certain frequency. a frequency does not have to be constant either like FM radio works. the carrier signal can be a combination of different frequencies, which makes it unique. there are virtually unlimited combinations. I don't understand the math behind it, but the way I intuitively grasp the idea is that you have this individualised frequency (each device has their own unique signal frequency). for lack of better terms, I'll call this the carrier wave. each device resonates on this exact frequency signal. again it's not constant, so think of it like a transformation on a constant. to make it easier to grasp the idea to we'll just equate it with symmetric encryption. you have a signal (source), then you have key which transforms that source into something unrecognisable. on the other end, you apply the reverse of that key to the unrecognisable message, and the source comes back out.

the "encryption" process has less to do with obfuscating the message and more to do with making the signal unique. no two people should ever have the same transform keys. all you would need to do to transmit and receive on someone's device. but, before I go there, since it's just a transformation process, you can think of it like a specially shaped mirror, that redirects the signal into a location inside of your body. if you want to transmit what your eyes see, their computers send a signal transformed specifically so only your device receives it, which is then tuning into a specific area inside of the body.

so, the tiny device installed in your body is simply a reflector. it resonates on the carrier frequency unique to the device, "reflecting" every signal it is resonant with. the device cannot be selective about what it reflects. it either reflects it all (working) or it doesn't reflect anything (broken). there's no in-between (ironically, kind of like me: all or nothing).

you can imagine that it'll take some time to understand this sort of technology. I believe tesla first discovered it by trying to figure out what was inside of the planet using his transformers. your body can be used as a "ground" source to which you can spatially tune signals into.

anyway, this technology and understanding of how to tune into things spatially is probably some years off, and I doubt the bso will reveal their secrets. that's fine though because I want to (and aim to) figure it out for myself -- eventually. maybe, I'll figure it out with the girls some time in the future. doesn't matter when or who does it -- eventually this sort of technology will become commonly understood by those interested in it.

the gutenburg moment will probably come when a company (or person, but likely a company) figures out how to do this, and makes it possible for you to receive signals from a device like that. if I had to guess, I would imagine it to be a games company that manufactures a tesla coil type device that just transmits locally. in order for it to discover the unique transformation of the individual's device, you will touch a surface, which will allow another tesla coil to tune into your brain and be able to, read the resulting signal, and due to imperfections in the design, be able to deduce the carrier signal. once the carrier signal is obtained, it should be relatively trivial to generate the transformation key.

you can see how having this device means that a gaming company could provide a rich gaming experience in an environment as captivating as my visual capacity allows for. imagine playing something like horizon zero dawn with the graphics like my eyes see. pretty amazing, and I think compelling enough for a gaming company to invest enough money into making happen.

Ok, that's enough to think about for now. I'm going to end this here, and resume again at a later time

### 2018-09-24 17:12 - the bso, LOA and regulation (more on the transformation bit)

so, if you think of a typical hash function. you can turn millions of bytes into 32 bytes. likewise, you could also add every byte together, discarding the carry bits and also arrive at a 32 byte number. the hash function has various transformations that are performed on the input data to obfuscate as much as possible the original data and make it as irreversible as possible. this is sort of like that. you are taking a lot of data (high frequency signal) and applying a set of transformations on it to get low frequency data.

there are some differences though: the hash function is designed to be irreversible, and their transformations are not. when I say irreversible, I mean I cannot start with the hash I want to create, then generate the source bytes necessary to get that exact hash. (if you could, bitcoin would be broken...) so, the way the hash function does this is to apply a series of transformations which discard some of the data. you could say that the transformations simply "discard" the carrier frequency, arriving at the source data. this does obfuscate what I'm trying to say right now, but hold on to it cause I'll come back to it.

a resonant device only resonates when the signal is correct. that's the whole point, so all one has to do is to begin generating carrier signals that slightly resonate, slowly honing in on the exact carrier signal. it's a process of elimination, but since you can tune into the location of the device inside of the body, you can detect when the signal is getting closer. think like a FM tuner as you get closer to the exact frequency, you hear the sound better. if you make the signal something simple like a square, triangle or sine wave, you can, through process of elimination figure out what transformations are necessary to make the carrier signal.

ok, so imagine now that you encounter that for this sine wave you apply these transformations and the same sine wave appears inside of the body. same thing with any arbitrary wave, means you've discovered the transformation key and can now send and receive signals inside the person's body. symmetric encryption.

however, if you discover that different signals have different keys, that means that the bso is applying some sort of unknown transformation inside of their device between the carrier and resulting signal. I find it unlikely that they would do that for some time, as it would increase the noise considerably in the signal/noise ratio. it would require greater precision for the 3rd party company's device as well as for the bso. it makes it more difficult for everyone, gives a lower quality result, and only slows the discovery down a little bit.. the function has to be reversible for it to work, so it's not impossible. in fact, there is literally nothing that they can do to prevent the device's reception/transmission of signals inside of the body once the transformation key is found.

it essentially is like a backdoor or a rootkit into anyone's body. all you would need to do is to discover the key is to find a way of tuning into the location of the body and sending carefully crafted signals to figure it out. this will be the discussion when continuing in the next entry.

peace

### 2018-09-25 13:40 - 4 primary states

I woke up this morning with the realisation that I now operate with four primary states:

(these are the basis of the conclusion I come to upon self-evaluation)

 - moving toward what I want
 - moving away from what I want
 - something is not important to what I want
 - physical evidence does not show it, but it feels like I am moving the right way

when I was young, I was either really happy, or horribly depressed. black and white; no inbetween. this was because I only had the ability to realise the first two of those states. I imagine that newborn childs are like this. they are either happy or not happy.

I think plants perhaps are only the first state. I remember when I was in 2nd grade, the teacher put a plant in a closet as an experiment. the plant grew much much taller than the normal next-to-the-window plants. I remember it grew to be much taller, like say twice the height of the other plants, but it looked very sickly. this horrified me. I remember it quite clearly, as I was overtaken by the height of the plant. there were many questions I had, but the main one was, "how could a plant with less sunlight (less nutrition), grow taller than the ones with the nutrition they needed?"

I determined that the plant was not in total darkness. some light had to be seeping into the closet somewhere. the reduced light the plant experienced made it try harder to find that light. I realised that the plant had no ability to formulate its own logic to formulate or create a way get its own light. looking back on it now, I realise the plant was pure desire, and the strong desire it projected to find light impacted me so strongly that it stayed in my mind. obviously the experimenter didn't have the same experience, because I don't remember the plant ever making it to the window. I think it got thrown in the trash.

anyway. I think that helped me to formulate an basic understanding that I wanted to only be going toward what I want. however, becoming aware that now I wanted to be only moving toward what I want, I suddenly became consciously aware of moving away from what I want. this is why I experienced such extremes in my emotional response to things.

I'm going to take a break for a moment. I want to speak next about how I began to create all sorts of logic to justify or redirect my path toward what I wanted... but it ties in with how things appear, and I cannot make the mental connection just yet

---

the key to my new understanding of this was an interaction I had with mom. I came to the realisation that they installed a new device in my nose after having gone outside and realised that things were more blurry than ever, and I have a new stinging pain spot that appeared overnight in my sleep, just like the last time. apparently the other one in my nose was not doing well enough, so they felt it was necessary to install more devices. naturally, I had a negative response to this. I've been trying to find a way to accept this whole thing and be ok with it, but I am having quite some difficulty with it. upon making this realisation, I felt the anger rise, so I just stuffed it as depression, to be worked on later.

outside, I allowed myself to become angry with the intention of making it back to feeling once again that everything is ok, and it's just a bit of a competition. the "spirit of elijah" is not my normal state of being. I don't normally decide that turning something into a competition, and allowing my success to appear as impossible as possible. I have not yet come to grips with the idea that I should encourage more water pouring on the altar, making the competition appear impossible for me to win.

so, it takes a bit for me to get there. my natural response is to fall into gripping depression when I notice that things are not going in the desired direction. however, I'm smart enough now to know that anger and depression are only indicators that my inner being does not see it the same way, so I have to convince myself that it's ok, and everything is fine.

mom comes out to ask me a question while I'm in the middle of feeling some anger still (cause I haven't yet got back to the competition, spirit of elijah mode). I react in frustration and anger, but I don't act so much on any of it. my query as to why I responded like that (cause it felt very similar to the time at new years where she wanted to come and interrupt me and tell me that I couldn't talk about devices reading people's minds). the reaction felt the same to me.

what I think happened, is someone from the bso alerted mom to my conversation and wanted to deter me from that conversation in new years. yesterday or whatever, it felt the same. I think the same thing happened. I think the train and the barking dogs and the other "nature" sounds weren't enough to distract me from going up the emotional scale on this issue, that they decided to have mom come and ask me a silly question to deter me from those thoughts.

it makes perfect sense that someone being aware of something they did not want (me thinking about my new device), without thinking made action to try and prevent that. also being in the awareness of something unwanted, I was in harmony to that action, so I reflected harmoniously that action with my own action (also without thinking).

this got me thinking about why I have such primitive responses now, which is how I came to these conclusions. I used to have a lot of logic (mostly socialisation, and some justification, all very valid reasons) to not respond in a fit of frustration and anger before. however, have you noticed that your logic can control your anger until you feel anger so strongly that you can no longer control your anger? I feel this not going in the direction I want to be going thing so strongly, that it is forcing me to evolve my personality.

I think what happens when you do a lot of mdma like I did, is it sort of erases most all of your logic. it does that to allow you to feel differently about past traumas and other things. mushrooms have a somewhat opposite effect. they enhance your logic by forming you to become dominant of your feelings. however, no one just gets new logic unless they actually believe it, so in order for mushrooms to be effective, you have to become open to a new logic change. they're aware of what you can handle and kind of throw you in the deep-end by invoking some of your logic (some call this paranoia), and showing to you how silly it is at the same time, you can have a sense of loss of ego (cause your identify is your logic), and you've got to change your logic on something to get rid of the paranoia.

I think these two extremes are parallels of what is happening in society today. dmt is similar to mdma in that it enhances all perception in such a way, logic is no longer relevant, and so if you have a lot of resistant logic, you will feel better on dmt, not because you don't have the resistance, but because things look so good, you're not as aware of the resistance.. that's why on psychedelic experiences you do not have the ability to logically comprehend the stuff you were seeing later when you return back to normal.

### 2018-10-08 - early morning thought

I woke up with a thought this morning, which honestly I had never thought of, but I'm gonna roll with it and make it my own. it goes like this:

after having listened to zaryn tell me enough times that I wouldn't have been able to make it without him, I'm treating this bso situation in the same way. I don't need them to become something. in fact, even with them working against me, I will still rise to quite a spectacular place, all by myself. let's leave the record crystal fucking clear that it was actually the bso who could not have done it without me, not the other way around.

I can roll with that idea.. I don't really want to make it my own too much though, because its emphasis is kind of on the wrong thing. if I'm going to go with the emphasis on the wrong thing, I like my previous way of thinking:

I am the only one now who actually is going to experience my own freedom any more; I *must* follow my own guidance. the rest of all of you *must* obey. you have to follow the guidance of someone else; it's what you agreed to do -- and even the people in the highest places are *also* held in bondage to someone or something, and have to obey. enjoy getting your guidance externally :)

### 2018-10-11 17:58 - weird day

for some really weird reason, today felt like an abraham workshop. there was tons and tons of energy, something equivalent to what I would have imagined to be like a workshop. I've been working on my programming this morning and had moderate success.

it turns out that it a lot of the tension and stress I was feeling was that I'm right on the cusp, or have already achieved another visual upgrade. the main theme around this whole thing has been coming to terms with the idea that I'll sort of be in this predicament for quite some time.

I listened to an abraham episode on youtube from the 2018-07-07 alaskan cruise: @[youtube](KPraPAiFObM) and in the episode, the general advice was to the woman to choose to leave the school before drugging her son. the idea is that the world should figure out how to keep up with him, instead of drugging him to slow him down to be more easily managed by his teachers (guides). I have a bit of a problem though because no matter what, I cannot leave. the drugs are not physical ones, but frequencies that slow my brain down to a stupor. I really want to leave, but I'm forced to stay and be drugged. I want so much to be free from this nonsense.

so, as I realised the hopelessness of the situation, I do recognise that like that woman, she wouldn't do much of anything trying to affect a change in the school (reform the school), and likewise I do not believe I will be making any difference whatsoever in my school, either. neither will they let me go, so I just have to get used to the current situation.

to further complicate matters, you can imagine how many problems it would create for the teachers, if they put me on stage regularly. perhaps the meeting today was to try and get the guy holding out at the bso focusing on all of the problems I would bring if I were to be put in a more public place. likely, they assured him that since they control all communications, they can manipulate the message however they want (or something like that).

doesn't matter though. I'm most concerned with my head-space. I want clarity of mind, vision, I want to feel the energy flowing through my body. I like feeling sensitive. I want to learn to control it, instead of constantly having my sensory organs giving my different signals (sometimes sensitive, and sometimes very dull).

I figure that there is no way that we can come to an agreement on my capacities. none. they will not release the limitations on them, and neither will they let me have control over what is happening in my head. they want to do whatever they want inside my head, whenever they want. I'm honing in on the ability to control more and more what is going on inside of my head. since I don't really have a choice, I'll find a way to make the next years of my life about regaining my own self-control.

I also terminated the fast. I felt too many external expectations on it. it felt similar to how quitting smoking had expectations attached to it in the carlota era. I wanted to learn more self-control, not prove some sort of status thing for people. I reasoned that I would prefer to take it the long and thorough route, similar to how noone can really pin a date on when I quit smoking, neither do I want it to be possible for there to be a day where you could say, that's when he quit food.

I did notice a change in feeling toward the end of the afternoon, but they're a one-trick pony: girls are not gonna do it. I *must* gain control over my own head, and really the *only* way forward for me right now is not an action-path: it's finding any way to feel better about where I am right now. I recommend that my friends in the meeting today consider the same. after all, any desire to control externally is only an outward manifestation of one's inward desire to have control over the same thing inside of himself.

### 2018-10-13 - the meek shall inherit the earth

I always wondered what "meek" meant. it always felt to me like it had simplicity and not lots of effort or trying to its feeling. anyway...

I've been trying to figure out the long-range vision on all of this for a while now. this is essentially just another stab at that.

the few things that are clear in all of this is somehow they have managed to figure out a way to get their minds to see similar to how I see. when I first got it, I got it with the help of the plant goddess, maiden ayahuasca. using brain stimulants, stars, or meditation you can increase your brain's frequency to see higher and higher frequencies (levels of detail). I believe the manifestation of this increased frequency is more DMT in the brain.

even though I have achieved these higher frequencies using external things, really if I want to keep the high frequency going, I have to release resistance in order to maintain it. not lying (to myself or others) has also decreased that resistance. this means that my brain is swimming in DMT now, and I should be having uncontrollable visionary experiences and all sorts of other psychedelic phenomena. I don't though, and that's because they are essentially reversing the DMT's effect.

in order to see through my eyes, your brain needs to run temporarily at that speed. however, like I mentioned, I believe DMT production is the result of a speed increase (even temporarily), and so likely my viewers brains also have more DMT hanging around.

from my perspective, the only way which I can explain the current situation, and how everyone just seems so willing to go along with the most incoherent ideas, reminds me of what it's like to be in the middle of a psychedelic experience. this sort of universal acceptance of whatever is necessary for the person to have an unbelievable experience, because it allows you to leave the category of normality and begin seeing things you never would have crossed your mind, *normally*. I also noticed this effect happening to me as well, and it comes along with vision upgrades, after long sessions of star watching, smoking weed, meditation, or really anything that allows me to release resistance, I believe I increase the amount of DMT in my brain, and I'm suddenly able to begin accepting bizarre things as normal or OK.

I think this is sort of happening to everyone on the nosebook network, and it's the most logical (and only) explanation that I can come up with, which explains why so many people think some of the nuttiest stuff is OK.

---

they're getting pretty good at keeping me away from anything psychedelic, and I'm sure they will allow some of those effects to occur, but only allowed in a controlled way. I will continue to release resistance and continue to see higher and higher detail levels. the stars help a lot, but one of the things that I noticed while hurricane michael was keeping the night sky cloudy, was that even without stars, I can still improve my vision. this proved for me that the vision increase has more to do with lowering resistance than it does with the stars.

so, a natural improvement in vision happens as a result of lowing resistance, allowing the frequency to rise.

up until now I believe everything I said is correct, but this is the part where I begin to speculate, so take it with a grain of salt. I think a lot of people are running their head at higher frequencies than are natural to them, probably not all the time but certainly enough for their head to have increased DMT levels, and I believe its psychedelic effects are mitigated as well.

you know that I have wanted to leave now for quite some time so I have given quite a bit of thought to what it will be like to have as much DMT as I have floating around, then suddenly there is no longer something mitigating its psychedelic effects... I imagine the first few days would be a non-stop trip like as if I were permanently on ayahuasca. I would quickly get used to it, and then from then on out I will only have these psychedelic flashes only in moments of high tension (strong emotion), much like tesla had throughout his childhood, until he learned to control it.

right now this is only a theory, but anyone with the ability to remove the device, or disconnect in some way could see if they begin to suddenly hear sounds/voices in their head and have lots of bizarre nonsensical visions. if that happens, that means that to the extent to which the person's brain has extra DMT, if for some crazy reason the service got shut down, a lot of people (but me the worst) will all be tripping pretty hard at the same time -- save for the simple ones that haven't had their head overclocked.

I imagine that one day something like a carrington event could occur again, rendering the service non-operational for some time. it does seem likely, and this type scenario would drastically change how things run on this planet. with 99% of the population tripping balls for an extended period of time, the ones with psychedelic experience (drug users and mystics) would make it back to reality the quickest. it would be the archaic revival and the cosmic event I'm looking to grant me freedom from my oppressors (at least until they get the service back online)

### 2018-10-19 13:35 - I am the "anti-christ"

I woke up just now with a realisation that I am essentially the anti-christ. I want to create a system similar to the one the bso has, but for personal use. the idea is that eventually you yourself would become the local-area broadcast tower from which other's can join your network. people would be connected to other people and sharing would happen naturally. I suppose a big tower could also be installed, but isn't within the goal. the goal for me is to create a network where people are able to access their own bodies and minds, and do not need some other entity to make that available to them. it's essentially what I would want in a network. there is not really an easy way to control people with a network setup like this, and control is not the goal. however, I suppose something akin to viruses could exist quite easily. something could spread from node to node, eventually gaining access to quite a bit of the network. I suppose other people could also write programs to interact with other people's bodies around them too. for example, kids might think it's fun to send emotes to their friends in real-time, but maybe for somebody like me, I would find that really annoying, claiming that I wouldn't want other people's emotions making an impact on my experience.

so it has its upsides and its downsides, but it is clearly very ahead of its time, because unlike computer systems, which have access control mechanisms, this tecnology is modelled after the fourth plane of existence the way I experience it (source-energy like) -- which is where individuals are each defined be their preferences and interests, but everyone has full 100% access to everyone else. you can jump between bodies, and in that instance you know all that they know. you don't have that experiential knowledge for yourself, so when you leave their body, like a dream it fades away quickly. put in more simple terms, you become a nearly perfect vibrational match to them, which is how you know what they know. in non-physical this works pretty well, because knowledge understanding and truth is temporary and only relative to the vibration of the moment, so your stream of desire and preferences "locks" you into your own experiential knowledge.

on earth here in the physical it doesn't work exactly the same. in non-physical, there is not really so much of an "experience" that is taking place (that's what we're accomplishing in the physical), so having full write access to everyone else is helpful for the transmission of understanding, but doesn't change the experience. here, someone else with full write access to someone else's physical experience can drastically affect them, and this technology has no way to discriminate between good and bad. it is only harmonic to frequency and vibration, meaning that once someone has access, they have it forevermore, and they can put anything they want into your body or mind. the only limiting factor is the knowledge of what the different signals mean to each person and their personal experience. this is why the bso is investing so much into trying to understand and track everyone and how they all work. without that knowledge, the signals do not have any meaning associated with them.

---

so, as I woke up, I realised that while I do believe this technology will gain me (and others like me) a whole lot of freedom, it's painfully obvious to me that there are not a whole lot of others like me. in my opinion, my situation is completely unsustainable. I *must* have a circumstances which foster the triad of intentions (which abraham talks about) that form the basis upon which all desire is born: freedom, growth, and joy. you guys *want* to live in a situation where people tell you what to do, how to think, and how to feel. I *must* have the freedom to make the decisions I want to make and pursue the things that interest me. you guys *want* to live in a place where certain things that are helpful to your expansion are kept away from you. take the stars or drugs for example. these limitations are put there by people with a superiority complex that do not want to lose their position as top-dog. for me, watching you guys blindly do what they tell you to do, is sort of like watching a bully make the smart kid feel bad because he wants to be smart like the smart kid but doesn't know how to get there, so he tries to keep the smart kid down on his level.

the only thing left is joy, so it's going to be interesting for me to see how this plays out, because a strong freedom-seeker or someone who must continue to feel expansion, can find these types of circumstances to be pretty not-fun. I believe you have to give up your freedom and expansion being the reason for your joy and find it in the simple pleasures like consumerism and sex. pleasure is not a replacement for joy though, and like abraham says, satisfaction (the precursor to joy) only comes from identifying a desire and moving in the direction of it.

the good news for my landscape architect friend is, this "resort" their building won't last forever. desire for more freedom and for greater expansion will accelerate, and it won't be until the majority of the people want it. that it will actually occur.

this is why what I want to make is ahead of its time. even though I see the value in it, that does not mean that everyone does. I cannot make up people's minds about it. much like tesla in his day with his visions of the world system, his disillusion was obvious when people did not see the value in his vision and inventions, and instead engaged in the second world war as their means to get rid of the "badness" in the world.

the reason why I began all of this claiming I am the anti-christ is because it is clear to me that no-one will save anyone. I could have the vision and and the technology, but it won't make an impact until there is desire for it.

I have a feeling that as time continues, the rich will get more empowered to do what they want and more resources to do so -- and the poor will get more disempowered and less capacity to get what they want. (that's the illusion of freedom and growth advantage those in power will get more and more of) however, another group of people will find their own freedom and their own truth within, regardless of circumstance. instead of having the freedom to *do* what they want (the action journey), their freedom will be to *feel* the way they want (the emotional journey).

pick your side I guess, cause I think it's going to get kind of extreme over these coming years. what I believe is happening is, I cannot help myself. I *MUST* go the emotional journey. there is just no other way for me to go. unfortunately, it sort of means being pretty aware of what I don't want all along the way, growing that desire in me for circumstances which foster freedom and personal growth. many people will observe and their will come to their own conclusions about it as will. I think it will cause such a bifurcation of opinion on the subject that eventually there will be a major timeline split, were desire is strong enough for the action journey team and the emotional journey team to both get what they want.

### 2018-10-19 16:49 - followup to previous entry: about timelines

I felt a few different questions arise in response to my last entry. when I say a major timeline split, I mean that the majority of consciousness splits itself between two different timelines.

this gives me the opportunity to explain how I understand the inner being to work. take for example all of the major sets of circumstances that exist with the girls. they are all real, and very much a reality -- however my consciousness is tuned in to this timeline. when life produces a desire in anyone, immediately that reality exists with the manifestation of that desire in it, but you do not experience it immediately, because your consciousness is tuned in whereever you are. in the future, technology will allow us to tune into other people and ourselves on different timelines. just like you can see through my eyes and tune into my experience, the same will be possible with other timelines.

I believe that everyone diverges ever so slightly from the mass consciousness timeline every day, and as you sleep at night, you rest and return to the timeline most suitable for you. it seems to me like there are slight differences between everyone's different timelines, and we converge (LOA brings us together) in something that is commonly agreeable.

so, when I say a timeline split, I mean that mass consciousness splits into two mass consciousnesses. similarly to the timeline splits with the girls (or anything you desire), those timelines exist and are reality -- only your consciousness is still tuned in to someplace else. so, conscious you are here and you (your inner being) is on a different timeline too, but you're not conscious of it.

so, what I predict will happen is that some major event will have another mass consciousness split away those who believe action is what it's all about: "the way I feel is influenced by my (and others' -- mostly others) action, and not only are others' actions responsible for the way I feel, but I also have to justify the way I feel with action."

I don't really have a good idea how any of it will turn out. I can only see there becoming a large disparity between those who believe others are responsible for their point of attraction, and those with strong desire (the triad of intentions) to be the dominant influence in their creation of their reality.

---

to put this in practical terms, I will use a hypothetical example of myself. I can't imagine how it could turn out for anyone else, just myself, but this is still hypothetical. so, let's say that my situation continues on similar to how it has been continuing on. I will continue to desire more and more the freedom to expand and grow at the rate at which I want to grow, free from the limitations placed on me. my power continues to grow as I gain more and more control over my experience.

in the bso's perspective, I am a huge risk to the charade they've got going, so I continue to grow more and more out of control for them (giving your attention to unwanted, only gets you more of it), so at some point in time they will attract a future where I am so far out of their control, they'll be generating mega mega desire to gain control of me. at the same time, I have mega desire to be in control of myself. something happens, and obviously since these two cannot exist simultaneously in the same timeline, a split will occur.

in one of the timelines I will probably just give up and die or something. in the other one, I will come into the fullness of who I am. but then, I'll get bored most assuredly, and seeing this other timeline where I have an impossible situation, you can imagine how much it will interest me to see if I can conquer this new "impossible" situation I managed to help create.

how is it impossible? well, as you can imagine, the bso are making pretty sure that they regulate how much dmt anyone is allowed to have in their brain. apparently I have too much for their liking. they must limit my sensory experience, because they can't handle the idea that someone may be superior to them. I assure you, soon they will have everyone in the world chipped and monitored to ensure that everyone and everything is regulated in such a way that they can feel good about themselves and maintain their superiority. any "risky" individuals will be held back and their capabilities limited (much like they do now to me -- so, in a sense, I am already creating and attracting another "impossible" future, to which I can overcome their limitations and *still* find a way of coming into alignment with my unlimited nature)

so, getting bored and recognising that contrast is fuel for the desire engine, I will be born again into the difficult timeline to build up even more energy and desire. again and again -- for sure.

---

totally speculation here, but I can imagine that I may have done this more than once before.. it's funny too because if I follow the pattern of it, it looks like I'm almost (on purpose) creating more and more impossible situations for myself to conquer (who doesn't like solving the problems they create!), and following the pattern, each time there is a split, let's say it's 50/50 (unlikely) and half of the consciousness chooses to continue to let others determine their point of attraction for them... it's sort of like dividing by two to get to zero; it never really happens, so in the end the timeline where these guys want to control everyone else's action will really only have the die-hards like myself and captain hardass over at the bso, left in the timeline. virtually all consciousness will have left that timeline and the consciousness creating the desire to maintain this timeline will just be endlessly micromanaging a much of unconscious people.

I will find it quite humorous when they finally get the technology to tune into other timelines and they see how technologically inferior they are, and much fun they've been missing out on spinning their wheels trying to control others so they can feel good. :P lol

### 2018-10-19 - "born again" after the pregame show

in the last entry, I used the words, "born again" because I liked how the christian symbolism felt when I was writing it, but then later that night while watching stars, I was thinking about it, and being born again: that is, growing my desire for freedom, growth qnd joy to be so much that when I'm born again into this world, I'd grow up believing that it's normal to have my visual capabilities limited by the bso (after all, I would have never known any differently) -- yet at the same time my strong desire to expand into the fullness of who I am that continues to grow even between lifetimes, will pull me forward much like how my life pulls me forward even now.

I grew up with such an increasing velocity that when I found my life come to a grinding halt because these guys decided they were going to limit me to only fulfilling their desire for me (and not my own), I found myself in a pretty rough spot. however, no matter what is the circumstance, I cannot help myself. I must move in the direction of the things that I want. I must have the freedom to think, feel, and do what I choose. no matter what this is the case, and this strong desire is only getting stronger, too.

in fact, it appears to me my present circumstances are only fostering that growth by making me continually aware of what I don't want: limitation of my visual capacity, mental lethargy, reduced energy, agility stamina, and disconnection from who I really am, etc.

so, being continually aware of what I don't want, I constantly have to pivot over to knowing what I do want, and move in the direction of that. practicing that kind of pivot is exactly what I will need to be very good at in order to come back without any memory of this, thinking that limited expansion is normal, and still be able to easily continue to move in the direction of my expansion.

I seem to have the "freedom" aspect pretty well encoded in my vibration, that I figure the major pieces that I'm missing is the unwavering focus on what I want, and the joy factor. I'm still figuring out the fun aspect, but I plan to find a way to get both of those down pretty well before I peace out.

regarding my return, I also realised this morning that kenny is just the pregame show. the real me will make his triumphant return sometime in future... so, I was thinking about our multifaceted nature, and noting that my inner being likely occupies multiple bodies right now on this earth. so, in fact this future me may even be alive right now. I started thinking about it, and what if it's someone I already even know... some ideas popped into my head, like what if it's bruno or andrea, or one of the other girls? could be, I suppose. why not, right?

thinking further, I remembered my origins here, where kenny was the willing container to house me. what if I spliced myself into kenny's body? I started thinking about it some more and it sort of makes sense... I was contacted by a future version of me from another timeline and through some carefully crafted messages, my point of attraction was put in a place where I would be interested in the andy pero story (project superman), then off to vallecas where I could try it out. which is potentially, where I spliced myself into kenny's body. sounds crazy, right?

so, then imagine now this timeline split occurs and for the people desiring to live the bso approved life, I will appear to die, but for me, my consciousness will continue on where my desire is strongest, which is to come into the fullness of who I really am. some event occurs which makes all of that possible and I develop the machine to tune into alternate timelines.

LOA leads me to another kenny in the bso approved timeline and I splice myself into him. I now live inside of the the bso approved timeline inside of kenny v2. using the techniques I described in previous entries, I adjust the timeline so that the craziest scenarios unfold (stuff like bunches of girls, flying, and other crazy things) so I have as much fun as possible. finally, a last disaster run must be made to bump up desire further and split the timeline again. since these body jumps are happening, I may be touching on "immortality" -- which reminds me of something I read in "tesla's last interview" -- maybe these timeline splits are more fun than I could possibly imagine. this really does sound like something that I would do, seeing the big picture like this... lol, yeah wow...

---

ok, so I left out a lot of details I haven't figured out yet, like how to make the timeline cyclical and other unknown stuff like why does it appear that I have two times I was spliced: brain haemorrhage and vallecas.

I figure I'll find out those key ingredients whenever I get connected with my visual capacity, so I'll give these crazy ideas a rest until then. it appears that I have figured out enough now that I'm satisfied to just practice my unwavering focus on what I do want, continue to bump up energy (creating a few problems maybe every once in a while), and figure out how to make all of this fun, so that I'm absolutely unstoppable.

«you want to be so good at finding your own satisfaction, that nobody is the boss of you»

### 2018-10-23 - the cube and the octahedron

woke up and one of the thoughts that I began contemplating was the cube and the octahedron. they are reversals of each other. meaning, if you connect the center of each of their faces, you get the other. an octahedron lives inside of a cube and a cube lives inside of an octahdron. a cube has 6 sides and is the realisation of 3 and root 3. you can turn a hexagon into a cube by running a line through the center at root 3. an octahedron has 8 sides and is the realisation of 4 and 2x root 2 (root 4). however, the 6 faces on the cube each have 4 sides, and likewise each of the 8 faces on an octahedron has 3 sides. beautiful symmetry.

** I just noted that perhaps you could possibly get an octahedron from an octagon if you ran two lines through the center at root 2.

as I was contemplating this, I think I figured out how to make the timeline cyclical. imagine you have two archetypes. for now, I'll call them moses and elijah. moses represents the internal conflict between desire and emotion. elijah represents the internal conflict between someone's beliefs (logic/structure) and physicality.

I had serious issues with this after my brain haemorrhage. emotion and logic are very similar, but they flow in opposite directions. you will notice that people with strong desire have uncontrollable emotional reactions to a lot of things. this is because of the direction the energy is supposed to flow. when something desired is experienced, positive emotion is generated and it flows immediately into action. smme thing with something undesired. this is moses.

next is elijah. he's a bit of a new one for me, since I am arriving to this archetype virtually, because circumstance in my life right now isn't letting me align my emotion with my desire. so what is elijah? I don't really know very well yet (still in the discovery process), but I do know that it is the reversal of moses. that's all I got so far there... we will obviously return here as I learn more, but like I said, it's the conflict between structure and physicality.

---

so, how do you make time cyclical and what does this have to do with reversals? we know that moses is the inward path turned external. the other major example of this archetype is jesus. when emotion is flowing in the same direction as desire, all is well, but when it doesn't mistakes are made. moses had a few major ones like this, and it started with killing a guy. jesus' death occurred when his emotion overtook his desire. he also started the ball rolling by overturning the money tables in the synagogue. when his emotion was flowing in the direction of his desire, he was master of physicality, "healing people, performing miracles and other signs and wonders."

so, if we extrapolate that as a reversal, the archetype of elijah would be a guy that when physicality is *not* flowing in the same direction as his logic (or belief system), then it produces in him strong desire for internal change (when you know what you don't want, you know what you do want). likewise when physicality *is* flowing in the direction of logic, it produces strong desire for external change. I think this is what makes things things cyclical.

as I'm writing this, I'm also noticing that desire for external change feels to me like negative desire -- and desire for internal change feels like positive desire. I had never noticed this before.

** I just noticed that, I previously have said many times that fear is just desire in reverse. I think this is actually what I mean. fear is negative desire for things external to be different... huh! interesting...

---

in my previous entry, I spoke that I am just the pre-game show. I'm not the main event everyone's looking for. the reason why I say that is, you cannot have a happy ending to an unhappy journey. so, now, let's imagine two entities that are performing this cyclical time jump (moses and elijah, let's call them). if both of them say that they are in fact the pre-game show, they are both speaking the truth.

let's take the hypothetical example I gave. in one timeline, I come into the fullness of who I am, but because the ride was so rough along the way (and you can't have a happy ending to an unhappy journey), he doesn't *really* reach the fullness of who I really am. I've got a lot of baggage floating around causing a lot of resistance. easily one coming after me could do considerably better of a job than me (though I find this unlikely, because like what happened in the church with jesus' message, it got distorted to benefit the church and maintain the church's control over their congregation).

imagine now the other timeline: the failure one. in this one I build up lots of desire internally for my next return, so that I have built up non-physical logic structures in such a way that I must follow my instinct to realise freedom and expansion in a more impossible situation still.

wait a minute!!! that means there are four cases! let's have a look.

* when elijah fails in this one, moses will be triumphant in the next. this is creation of internal desire.
* when moses fails in this one, elijah will be ti

this is really complicated. I'm going to come back to this... peace!

### 2018-10-27 18:04 - the latest bit that I've pieced together

it seems to have been very important for all of the different christ symbolism and also the moses elijah stuff too, as they have been key to my understanding of the core concepts upon which this latest version is built.

we know that whenever someone (even a single celled ameba), you "a rocket of desire eminates from you." the inner being of whatever it is (its non-physical part) immediately becomes the realisation of that desire (and all of the many ways to get there). from there on, that new point of attraction pulls you toward the realisation of itself. there are infinitely many ways to get there, and there are infinitely many combinations of people with whom you can do it with.

you could say that every time a desire is born, there are a (small) infinite(ly) many new timelines are created along with each desire that is given birth to. the only reason why you're still seeing "the present" and not the realisation of that desire, is because you're tuned into your present circumstances, and not the the realisation of whatever it is. in the future, it will be possible to navigate and tune into different timelines and even alter them, creating new ones which you can also tune into and see the results. got that?

ok, so what I believe happened is the following:

the andrea timeline happened. fwh refers to it as "planet hope" -- which is a direct reference to the "esperanza" diagram that I drew at marcos house. fwh is me in that timeline, affecting this timeline. why? well, here's my new theory...

imagine that future bso gets pretty good at controlling my body through their devices. in fact, imagine that these guys can make a clone of me and operate the clone's body as if it were their own. they are very interested in making clones, and I'm very interested in having multiple bodies which I can influence emotionally. these clones would be 100% autonomous, but the bodies could also be controlled remotely.

[quick break]

### 2018-10-27 19:41 - and, we're back...

I had quite a few reactions about the part about the bso controlling my body, and I don't know how it works fully (ask them about it!), but it seems to me that right now they are able to send electrical impulses into my body and it'll move, but I don't believe this will always be the case. I think, to some extent now, and probably a whole lot more in the future, if the movement they are trying to make in my body doesn't match the emotion my body has, it won't work.

I'm talking about a micro level of individual muscles -- even though you already know this is the case already for me on a macro level: eg. if I cannot feel what it is that I am "supposed to do" I am paralysed, and cannot move in the direction of what is expected of me. feeling is key, and it is actually what I began to learn about today as a response to last night's shock therapy. soon, as I lower resistance more and more, even the shocks won't affect me -- after all, the shocks are only very rudimentary impulses which contract the muscles uncontrollably, but you can imagine that with a more refined interface, those gross motor impulses caould become fine motor impulses. I digress...

the point is, at some point, the limiting factor to my movement is emotional. this is probably why I experienced paralysis after vallecas: I could no longer feel the freedom of my left side, and it reflected that in its movement.

so, imagine for a moment that one of the bso boys wants to jump into one of my clone's bodies to control the physical movement of some activity. let's say it's sex. if their movement, or the intent of their movement does not match the emotion which I am influencing the clone with, the clone will suddenly freeze up and you will probably see him kinda have one of those stuck moments that are so typical of me when I feel conflicting emotion over some action.

so, no real harm with them jumping into my clones' bodies, as I will still have the ultimate control over the clone's expression, emotionally. they cannot make the clone do something that is incompatible with the momentary emotion.

this, you can imagine can create all sorts of different scenarios, as also influencing factor, you have the emotion of the situation, the emotion of the other "co-creators" in the situation with the clone, but ultimately my own emotion has the most priority. let's say for example, I am projecting a silly emotion to my clones, and let's say one is having a conversation, so that comes out as a joke, and two others are having sex. for one of them, the silly might come out, (because of the way she feels), as some very strange manoeuvre, but let's say the other one is feeling perhaps insecure about herself, and so that may come out as a silly comment which (in her mind) amplifies that insecurity. upon feeling her insecurity, I will be able to project into that situation a feeling of both security and probably something like desire for her to feel more secure about whatever that was.

now let's extrapolate that out a bit. imagine instead of just one bso boy, there are hundreds. I remember one abraham workshop where andrea was talking about how good it feels to have so many people there having the same experience with you. well, this would be kind of a little more next-level, because the clone would respond to the strongest impulse sent to it, which fits into the emotional framework projected by the controller of the clone. so, this would mean you could have 100 dudes controlling a man having sex with you, and the clone would respond within the framework of the emotion projected to it (structure), and essentially would essentially act out the strongest (most popular) impulse to action. the impulses are culmulative too, so 100 guys wanting to thrust feels stronger than 10 guys wanting to thrust. you can see how this could be some new way of doing team building or something, lol...

back to the story. the esperanza thing took place, and since fwh mentioned many times that he was transporting people to planet hope, I believe this means that he was saying that this timeline is contrived. imagine for example, someone seeing my plight actually tried to help me and totally wrecked the bso secret. that would make things a whole lot less "believable" that I'm really a guy who manages to continue to believe in my own truth, even though quite literally the whole world is saying something different.

in order to make a very extraordinary person, that person needs to be in very extraordinary circumstances. the timeline has to be orchestrated in such a way where these impossible odds are actually contrived. anyone who had a shred of sanity in them got put on the esperanza timeline (this was back in 2012-2013 -- well before any of this happened), and all the people who would blindly believe the bso and obey their commands stayed on this timeline. since the timeline is contrived to be 100% full of people who don't question what they're told to do, you can imagine why fwh almost always referred to this timeline as "3d hell"

so, that begs the question, why would anyone contrive such a timeline to be this way? I believe it has to do with the clones. I am realising that the same way this timeline is contrived to be filled with the correct people to make this as an impossible of a situation as possible to overcome, the timeline is also influenced in such a way that no matter how hard I could possibly try, I won't be able to end up with another girl. fwh has, it seems, been able to influence me emotionally, essentially making it impossible for me to go down any of those paths. this timeline is designed that I figure out how to connect with who I really am, by myself, without anyone's help, and in the most statistically impossible odds.

along this journey it seems to have been designed in such a way where all sorts of desire will be born, creating all sorts of alternate timelines. here's where it gets interesting: normally, if you give birth to a desire and you don't go, only your inner being had the experience. you never gave yourself the opportunity to experience it because you kept your focus on something else, never allowing yourself to tune into that future.

HOWEVER, imagine one of these strange scenarios with these girls gave rise to a timeline where eventually I made or got a hold of technology which could tune into different timelines. you could imagine that in every case, the very first timeline anyone in a relationship would check is, "what if we never ended up together? where would we be then?" -- and so obviously every single timeline where I ended up in a relationship, all of us would eventually find ourselves paying close attention to this timeline. essentially, this timeline has to exist for all of the me's to meet all of the other me's. we would all meet at the "end" of this timeline.

gonna take another break. when we come back we will cover:
1. what does the "end" of the timeline mean
2. what does all these me's have to do with all these clones?
3. the rerealisation of "saturn"
4. what this means for the future
5. the different models and their (emotional) effect

### 2018-11-01 14:33 - justification of action (and some major realisations)

I woke up this morning and I had a few realisations:

1. the thing they're trying to undo is my idea that this timeline will be a solo operation.
2. the reason why they cannot talk to me is because they would have to admit that what they want from me is some sort of sexual action, and my refusal to do it would mean that now they are forcing me to do some sort of sexual action -- which is sort of like rape.

so instead, they just steer me in the direction they want me to go. you may think that sort of sounds like sexual harassment -- where it's no longer forced, but strongly suggested, or even made impossible to avoid.

so then, I was thinking about how in the world this is considered OK. the conclusion I arrived at was that you can justify it by saying that the outcome has a greater benefit for more people, as so they can, in a sense, use me as a "sacrifice" for the greater good.

I went outside to think about this in the sun. before going out, I left off with the other realisation that because they want to steer me toward their goal, I am not allowed to move any energy toward what it is that I want -- meaning, they put resistance any time I am not going the direction that they want to go.

this sort of has the opposite effect though. you may think that steering works for an emotionally oriented person like me, but you have to think of it like tuning: if I cannot go towards things that I want, no matter how hard you try to convince me that this thing that you want for me is something I want -- I cannot go toward things that I want. lol

anyway, I've been learning a lot about tuning lately and am excited to try it out, because I'm realising that even though my physical experience contains no evidence of things going the way I want them to go -- and so therefore, no reason to be happy -- I can, instead choose the way I feel, and not have any justification for the reason why I feel that way. in fact, looking at it with any logic at all, I should not be feeling good. it's pretty cool that, despite all of the "injustices being done to me", I am learning how to tune myself into the direction that I want to be going.

I was reminded of the imagination girl that I met at the bbq church event. I understand that circumstances aren't the greatest, and that is primarily my reason for calling this whole thing off, so I reasoned, "well, I think you should make plans to go your own way -- though if you want to wait for circumstances to improve, there might be a chance."

I *really* don't like the idea of leading people on, so I immediately regretted the thought. instead, I really like the idea of going at this solo. I mean, I really really really like it. all of these timelines exist and one day we will be able to tune ourselves into them much easier.

(btw, if her consciousness is here in this timeline that means that from her broader non-physical perspective she has more go gain here on this timeline)

instead, I like the idea that I will continue on going my own way, «not needing the manifestation to feel good» and eventually, (more on this in future entries) we will be able to clone me, and this clone will be the most awesome of all.

millions of the future self-realised and even further improved on version of me will be able to be "grown" for anyone to try and see if they can form a *creative* relationship with.

you could say that I'm taking this present non-action for the future greater benefit of all. lol
