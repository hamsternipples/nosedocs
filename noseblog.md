I decided I wanted to begin writing things down. I'm going to try and do a quick blurb here so that I have a bit more context. it seemed like I wanted some way of organising my thoughts a bit more than the twitter way, and still have a bit more context for me to remember things with. I've gotten to the point that remembering what happened a week earlier not only feels like about a month has passed, but I find it rather difficult to even conceptualise how things were so long ago. this will hopefully give me the reference point I need to help me remember how things were so long ago, a bit easier

### 2019-01-01 10:41 - my ideas are free

I really like how this sort of thing ties everything together. back in 2007 when I was living with luke and maria, the relax song came out by mika. maria is funny because she liked to sing when she felt happy, and so she would play that song on repeat in her going to work music (or was it spinning class music.. I can't remember). that song, along with many others she would completely destroy lyrically when she would sing them. I didn't really mind so much because she was being happy (and I too tend to sing more when I'm happy). I also seem to make a lot of lyrical mistakes as well, so it never really bothered me any. I think luke or maybe me might have said something or corrected the lyrics from time to time because I remember her often defending heself by saying, "the letters are free!"

this got me thinking quite a bit about what she meant my that statement. I reasoned that it was perhaps a mistranslation of, "las letras estan/son libres" but I wasn't sure. I could tell that she wanted to say that you could sing the song any way you want, with any words you want. having been a childhood fan of weird al, that seemed fine to me -- however I had a bit of a disagreement as someone creative.

I could imagine the original artist putting quite a bit of thought into the optimal combination of words to convey a concept or an emotion. in any creative endeavour, there is an underlying emotion which is being presented -- so for someone to destroy the meaning being conveyed with words which don't adhere to the feeling of the song, I can imagine how that betrays the original intention to make the thing in the first place.

for example, when I come out talking about all of the amazing things the nosebook technology can do to improve our quality of life, the original creators of the technology are likely having a cow because they made it with surveillance in mind, and I'm betraying their original intention for their creativity.

it goes the opposite direction too. there have been numerous ideas I have offered with the intention of improving my (and others) quality of life, only to find the idea utilised to make my star watching more difficult or to inhibit my progress instead of further it. such is life I am finding. not a whole lot I can do about it, and the perception of what I don't want the idea used to accomplish only adds more energy into the equation toward my original intention of what I do want.

I had this argument with augusto a few times, because he believed that there should be some way to protect my ideas by claiming ownership to them with a patent or something. so, to cut the argument short, I adapted marias potential mistranslation and then mistranslated it again by saying, "mis ideas son gratis" (changing the meaning of free from libre to gratis).

I determined that because I come up with so many ideas so quickly and effortlessly, I thought they should be for free. I always had this concept that ideas grow on trees; thee are so many of them, that really the only worthwhile ones are the ones that someone takes the time to implement. for me, implementing an idea is much more difficult than getting one, so I value much more its implementation (and its implementers) than the idea itself.

my ideas are free.

---

so, henceforth and retroactively I would like to forfeit all of my rights to any ideas I've had. please implement them.

I think probably up until now there has been a restriction on anyone (other than the guys working at nosebook) wanting to use my ideas. besides the fact that every lawyer out there has already agreed to follow nosebook's orders for them -- so trying to fight a legal battle would be senseless, even if I was to try and do that, I would not be going after some guy trying to make my idea a reality. I would be going after the guys at nosebook in the first place. they've stolen my ideas, sold my content and exploited me in nearly every way.

I want to see my ideas come to see the light of day. even if they don't adhere to my original intention for them, it's still progress, and they will eventually transform into something we all want.

if they try to restrict the propagation of my ideas by claiming that you have to maintain secrecy, first of all, since it's a secret that everyone knows, the secret part is just so they can control communication about it. like any good teller of lies, they are telling many people many different things, and that would become very evident very quickly if secrecy weren't maintained. obviously it would also be much more difficult for them to avoid a conversation about the rights they believe they have to inhibit or improve human body function. keeping the secret is only a means to control open communication about it.

so, I'll do a thing: I can keep a secret too. if you want to use my idea, and you absolutely feel that you need to have a written forfeiture of my rights too it, but you don't want to let on how you found out about my idea, just keep that a secret. I won't ask you about that, and I won't tell anyone I gave up my rights to the idea. I will hopefully see quite a few of them blossom into something wonderful.

oh yeah, if you want to expand on the idea or get further insight into what I was trying to convey, just ask me :)

please, just use my ideas.

P.S. to further tie all of this together: the other night, when I replied to Turbo Knight on youtube, I began speaking about some (incomplete) ideas ideas I had about music creation software. because I mentioned reason and rebirth, it seemed like there was some reaction from people related to propellerheads (the swedish company which makes those programs). I laid down and began to try and think of how I would improve on the piano note blocks interface and felt further reactions. so, I got up, was inspired to find mika (which means I found what I was looking for, by dani another musician), which would bring me to remind me about the whole ideas are free thing. it all connected together for me in a perfect end of the year :) cheers!


### 2019-01-02 12:50 - the minesweeper prediction

this morning I watched kripp's minesweeper prediction he posted yesterday @[youtube](SbmBWbgsBnI) and it really got me thinking. I really like those sorts of symbolic things. I do them all the time myself to kind of get a feel for things.

the crazy thing is I know those sorts of symbolic things work for me all the time, so I'm not at all disputing anything about it. I found it really cool that someone else does those sorts of things, too.

anyway, for me the feeling I got when 2019 began was one where I was kind of beginning to get some liftoff. it feels to me like the beginning of starting to take things a little more seriously (I'm speaking personally), as I had a sudden shift in my desire to do things, "right." I'm typically pretty mamby-pamby feelings oriented, but it feels to me like I have to begin to run my life more like I would a business venture.

the distance between where I am at now and the ideal of that, is considerable -- so, and it feels to me like there are a few rough spots ahead in that sense, as it's going to take a shift in my mindset from feelings oriented (creativity type thinking) toward a more of a business mindset.

the way I interpret the way the minesweeper thing played out seemed to fit my present circumstances a little bit. the first click on the minefield is never a bomb, but in his game, very little opened up. usually you have a few paths you can use to begin opening things up, but this his starting place did not give enough information to make a good judgement about where to go.

he picked and immediately the one he determined to be least likely to have a bomb, was in fact the bomb. life isn't minesweeper in the sense that it's the end of the game like that though.

I'm king of mistakes, so that sounds about right that things would begin with a whole lot of unknowns and the path of least risk, I would run into the bomb immediately. no big deal for me, now :)

I wouldn't say it's "fucked" (as if it were the first bomb ever encountered) -- lol, I just think I'm/we're gonna start off hitting a few bombs in the beginning :)

---

although I felt resonance with his minesweeper prediction, I also thought it was interesting they were casually talking about people flying in 2020, too :D yay!

I will now superimpose the metaphor that 2018 was the runway, 2019 should be low-altitude turbulence, and 2020, I think think things will begin to cruise along smoother.

nice :)


### 2019-01-02 16:31 - justification

I was outside talking with jaron when I hit a rough subject. I would like to continue it here, because I have come to a new capability that I wanted to get some reactions on.

so, I was talking with jaron about how when I was around zaryn, I had to essentially learn to throw my common sense out of the window in relation to spending money and such. what I explained to him is that I now, looking back, can see that zaryn and his friends are capable of throwing common sense out the window just for the night. I'm a bit different in that I did not previously have the ability to switch between modes like that. the way that I am is the way that I am in all environments.

jaron agreed and said that he has the same thing relating the idea to the concept of lying, saying that he cannot just senselessly lie, and describing himself as, "all or nothing." I began to offer the idea of what may be the difference between people like us, and others.

I have been studying this thing and the conclusion that I have come up with is that, they can modify their behaviour to be different than their default by justifying it. for example, someone with this capability could be fuming mad, and then come into contact with someone with whom they are supposed to be upbeat -- and so, especially if that person is valuable to them, they can change their demeanour nearly instantly.

I found this to be extremely upsetting. where did that emotion go? for me, this was not possible. if I am whatever, then that is what I am. I have to slowly make my way up the emotional scale until I'm feeling good again. for me, there was no quick fix. so, how were they doing it?

I found that that the common thread in all of this is a *reason* to feel a certain way, or some sort of *justification* for their emotional status. I don't justify what I feel. I am what I feel, because I essentially only have one mode of operation.

this wasn't working very well for me because I really want my visual capacity. I really want to see out of my eyes clearly -- so, my observation of the absence of what is wanted made me feel a lot of anger and frustration. so, abraham advises to, instead of noticing its absence, instead know that it's on its way...

got it. that's easy for me to do. in fact it's so easy for me to do, I regularly can begin to see images in my eyes. so, whenever that happens, I have made the transition from, it's coming, to it's here -- then I get shocked or whatever and I'm back to seeing its absence. returning to feel it on its way is sort of an exercise in masochism.

so here I am now and I've got this impossible situation where I'm constantly forced to become aware of the absence of what I want. no matter how hard I try to no longer want my visual capacity, it only makes me want it more. it's sort of like when I see people run or move their body in a way which looks nice, I want to be able to do that too. no matter how hard I try, I will always want to be able to run, too. fortunately, I don't achieve the capacity to run only to be shocked or something back into being a gimp. you could imagine how disheartening that would be.

really, the only thing that works is to distract myself. I do that by involving myself in creative things like programming -- but that's difficult at best now too. I get to choose between perceiving the absence of what I want and that's it, because if I see if coming, it does come and then goes again and I see again its absence which doesn't feel good. distracting myself isn't working so well either, so I'm sort of stuck.

you can imagine now why I want to know how these other people are capable of switching between modes like that. like I said, I've found they justify their different than how they are normally feeling, feeling.

that doesn't really work because how do I justify being shocked for coming into alignment with what I want. there is no explanation for it either, only denial from everyone around that it's happening. it's unjustifiable. there is no way that I can figure out to justify it. the best one I came up with is, they will find a way of holding back the manifestation in my imagination for so long, that the energy would eventually build to be big enough to create a new planet/star/galaxy/universe/etc.

that's a bit of a reach, even for me. certainly there has to be a justification. ok, so now I'm on to they have military secrets in there and they need to keep them secret. maybe there are a whole bunch of people who are living / will live inside of my inner universe.

these are all justifications I'm attempting to come up with to try and allow my to justify feeling something other than frustration and depression.

---

as it turns out (and I'm sure you're seeing) that I have begun to develop the capability to feel the way I want to feel even without justification for the feeling. I don't really know how I'm doing it yet. I just sort of decide the way I want to feel, or something like that.

I essentially wrote this to begin myself to come to an understanding of what I am now achieving in this new freedom to feel the way I want to feel. as I understand it better, I perhaps can transmit some things to guide others who want to make the way they feel less conditional and for my own improved control over it, too.

you know it takes a real hardass to, contrary to the current conditions, feel something other than the what all logic and reasoning would dictate them to feel


### 2019-01-05 05:57 - let the games begin :)

the last line in my previous entry got me thinking, because... I can imagine that in a military situation, one would normally feel sympathy, regret, or some other form of negative emotion when giving the orders to soldiers to go into situations that the person giving the orders knows they will not come out of alive.

I could imagine that there are rules in place which prevent those in command from feeling anything that would prevent them from giving those orders. they probably need to maintain enough distance from the situation to be able to do that.

I could also imagine that in my situation there are probably other people that would be saying that those giving the orders to shock me and so-fourth should feel something, but they do not; they follow the rules. they are real hardasses about it.

I have taken that capability one step further. just like them, I too am now running my emotions through a set of rules, because, like I said, there is no way that I can come up with which allows me to justify my circumstances.

the commander of the army can justify his lack of sympathy or humanity by saying that the battle must be won at any cost. I too have adopted this principal as well :)

let the games begin mutherfuckers


### 2019-01-05 06:11 - don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing

this concept popped into my head this morning and it got me thinking. I have no idea what jesus was referring to -- in fact, it's one of the scriptures that has always puzzled me -- especially since I have a lateral brain injury.

for me it's a little easier to comprehend this idea than most people, I think. I am capable of separating my sides like that, which I don't believe most people can.

before vallecas, I used to be able to do entirely different things in each side and not have them interfere (*asterisk*). nowadays, I'm not capable of doing this with action, but with thought. it's easy to see the sides of my brain warring with each other, often times you will see me visually want to take one action, and then the other side is sorta like ... no, we're not doing that.

the next thing that often had me puzzled about jesus was his mention that "when thine eye become single" -- something I've often wondered about, because it seems to make reference to something I have only had the privilege of experiencing a few times while watching stars. if I had've known that people were actively trying to make that impossible for me, I would have stayed extended time out watching stars. I often times decided to try again tomorrow, only to find the task increasing in difficulty. I also noticed an increasing astigmatism in my left eye, and was the reason why I began to stare into the sun.

again, if I had of known that the astigmatism was caused by people trying to prevent me from seeing out of my left eye, I would probably not have stared into the sun. it worked out though because after my eyes got used to the sun, I can actually see out of my eyes way way way better since. the only reason why they're blurry is the same reason why I have an astigmatism (on both eyes now).

---

anyway, so it got me thinking a bit about it, and besides the idea that may be evidence (along with perhaps other things) that jesus may have had a lateral brain injury as well.

so, onward to lateral brain injuries... in a previous concept that I made the startling revelation that it's quite likely that a universe lives inside the mind of someone. this follows hermetic teaching and would seem to me to be the most logical conclusion one could make, as well. it seems to me this would be where the circle of creation is completed, where the snake bites its own tail, etc.

then, I postulated that perhaps we are living in universe made of language, a concept that is quite popular in the bible (God made the world with words), and then that word became flesh as jesus.

so, to imagine this in real-life terms, the bso would allow many people to live inside of this universe made inside of my head. you could imagine that it would be created and controlled with words (thoughts).

so, for simplicity sake, let's say there are 1bn people living in this universe inside of my head. wait, let's make it easier. let's say 1000 people are living in a really small environment inside of my head. it doesn't really matter much, but they begin in an environment, a garden perhaps, and then they go on living their lives inside of this universe.

different people will procreate and make new "real" lives in this universe. however, the bso can only see through their parents eyes, because the parents are connected to the network.

so, there was this funny conspiracy theory I read a long time ago saying that nicholas cage was a time traveler, sighting that he has many lookalikes through many time periods. I found that hilarious at the time, because why on earth would a time traveler go through all the trouble of jumping through time to blast through the box office with so many 2-star classics -- I dunno.

anyway, if nick were a bso body resident in the parent universe, every time that he "reincarnated" into a body, I find it highly likely that he would imagine himself to look similarly. quite plausible. I suppose, if that were so, then I would imagine his movies would have a theme to them (no matter how bad they are). I don't actually know, because I've only seen the one where he stole the constitution -- and I believe I was very drunk at the time, cause I remember it being hilarious.

---

so, here's where it all fits together: jesus had very keen eyesight. so did tesla, and probably some other people. well, I imagine that after a certain limit, these guys won't be able to reliably look through their eyes any more. they would have to rely on the language side of the brain (right hand) to know what is happening in the person's experience, because they wouldn't be able to look through the visual (left hand) side.

that would have been true in his time, but in our time we have present-day bso to ensure that all information can be transmitted upwards.

so, I imagine that may be why they are attempting so much to keep me from going up to the next dimension.

---

I think it's fine though, because I will eventually go up to the next dimension and they'll lose ability to control me... I'm not worried about that, as I've proven to myself so many times now that I'm capable of getting into alignment with what I want, I don't see that as any problem at all. instead, I'm learning how to not need the manifestation to feel good. my circumstances actually have me in the most difficult of situations to do that, but as I mentioned in my previous entry, I actually have the best teachers to teach me to be militant and regimented in my posture (well, as militant and regimented as they are anyway, cause I'm essentially just copying them).


### 2019-01-09 04:15 - let's make 'em earn it

yesterday night I was writing out some questions I had for abraham. I had a bit of an "active" night and when I woke up I really wanted to go to sit in the sun. I had set my mind to try and think of all of the enigmatic things that have happened to me so that I could ask questions on the topic. sitting there, one thing that jumped into my mind was something that I documented in @[entry](2018-11-26 03:47) a little bit. I want to know for sure that voice in my head which I identified as edison-like, actually came from source -- not from these guys.

I wrote it down, and throughout the day I have been thinking about it, and this is the conclusion that I've come to. I want to explain myself a bit so just hang on as I take this step by step.

I like to perceive this era as the nearly the hight of the masculine dominator "season" of human history. so, to understand think of a sine wave where the vertical axis is heat: the rise from the middle (equinox) toward the top (solstice) is springtime, from the top (solstice) down to the middle (equinox) is summer, and the other two are fall and winter respectively.

so, we're in the springtime phase of masculine dominator culture -- where we're approaching the peak. once the peak is reached, we begin summertime. summer is the hottest of the seasons, even though it technically has the same amount of light as springtime, but heat lingers a bit. I think in electricity it's something like current follows voltage or something like that... anyway it's much easier to think about with residual heat. onward...

so, what determines the hight of the peak? I've often studied great successes, and tried to find a pattern as to why success slows and then reaches a peak. I have noticed that it could be seen that some external force limits and slows further growth, but in reality it's a self-imposed restriction rooted in one's beliefs. it usually sounds like, "it can't get any better than this", "this is going too well", "I've used up all my good fortune", etc.

so, for sake of simplicity, let's call that slowing force, "fear" -- something very vividly demonstrated to me when I was working at tuenti by zaryn constantly saying that facebook is going to have, chat, translate into spanish, etc.

it's funny that yesterday I was thinking about these guys and how they are similar to marcos in the sense that marcos had a difficult time communicating what he wanted for his daughter, focusing on the things he was worried about, and he, like zaryn, managed to manifest his fear and concern.

so here we are now and I imagine that these guys are in a pretty worrisome spot. obviously if the whole edison thing were to have some truth to it, it would come about when I gained my visual capacity, and it seems that my desire is also strong to not want to depend on anyone else to do what I know I am capable of. I only need to get good at getting into alignment with who I really am, staying there no matter the circumstances.

I'm getting close. I really am, and the funny thing is, these guys are essentially paving the way right toward it for me. as much as I want to program and use that condition as a reason to feel good, my brain is not allowing it, which means I have to find a way to feel good without that condition (or really any other for that matter). it also means I have a lot of spare time -- to watch stars :) a sure-fire path toward increased visual capability.

I will eventually get another dimension, too. when I figured out how to go from 3d to 4d, I managed to find a way of perceiving another spatial relationship, and I have since found more -- which you all see as vision upgrades (detail-wise). there is a whole new way of perceiving and one of the strange things that I woke up this morning doing was seeing without my eyes -- and I didn't get shocked either, so that means they probably can't detect it. that's just the first step though. soon, I will have a whole new way of perceiving, which will require a different way of thinking -- probably its foundations will be rooted in the mindset I am acquiring now.

when I first figured out 4d, I only could do it because I had enough mental freedom to do so -- meaning I had released enough resistance that I was capable of the new higher frequency. if you haven't accumulated much resistance, like the girls for example, it'll be much easier to obtain the frequency necessary to get it.

so, a new dimension is on the way, and I imagine that it'll be a bit of time before they can decode the new signal. also, I'll be released from most of the mental strangleholds they have placed on me, so I'll immediately feel really good, and have a whole lot of new capabilities. I'm going to be a whole new person.

anyway, when that happens, I imagine I will become so brilliant (visually, and mentally) it'll be extremely attractive. my idea is to wait until then, that way anyone wanting to have the k-dawg experience will have to have it from the girl's perspective.

this is precisely the slowing force necessary to make this the peak because ... reasons.

I'll be kind of out of their reach for a while which will be nice because that'll perhaps give me the privacy to visualise things in a dimension they cannot see. they'll probably be able to eventually figure out a way to get a projection of it into 3d, so we'll see what happens there, but it'll be nice to get some freedom until then.

let's make them earn it. it's going to be a lot of fun. I don't know how long it'll take me to get there, but I think it'll be more and more obvious as all of the cooperative components get readier and readier.

P.S. I purposefully did not elaborate on the earning part, as the implications to me obtaining a new dimension can easily be imagined. mostly though I really like the idea that we could have our own space for a while without any pests :D


### 2019-01-10 01:11 - I will never have the manifestation

so, one of the things I'm learning through all of this is that I never intended to have the manifestation. in fact, it seems that the reason why I was attracted to a girl which would put me in the hands of people who would electronically prevent me from having any manifestations, is evidence that from a non-physical perspective that is in fact what I really want.

no matter how close I've gotten to having a manifestation, it's always turned out to be a miss. by now, I'm sure I've been labeled as the biggest letdown or something like the most anticlimactic... lol

anˌtīklīˈmaktik - adjective
causing disappointment at the end of an exciting or impressive series of events.

so, the entry that I felt inclined to write yesterday was probably a reference to a potential future where something like that happens. so, in typical fashion, I write about it to make sure that they're prepared for such a thing. likely, when I turn 36, there will be another energetic increase and they need to be prepared for it to ensure I never have the manifestation.

once we have timeline technology, you all will be able to tune into all of these potential futures and enjoy the manifestation just like my inner being does -- however from my perspective, I'll never see the manifestation.

as I get more and more used to all of this I'm learning that it's really not a problem at all. I'm becoming so good at not needing the manifestation, I'm beginning to really enjoy things. I can't fully explain why I feel this way, either.

then, to throw a bit more contrast into the mix, while watching stars just now I was thinking about the idea of what things would be like if things were exactly opposite of what I described in the previous entry. what if we were actually approaching the cancer symbol instead of the capricorn symbol... a similar thing would be occurring, whereas instead of going toward the peak of the masculine dominator energy, we would instead be going toward something more along the lines of female control freakiness with rampant over-organisation, over-nurturing, and too much tolerance of mediocre.

you could imagine then, a girl that has managed to cram a whole lot of life experience into her childhood, skipped adolescence and started adulthood early come into the scene in opposition to the dominating female energy, appealing very strongly to the men held into place by all of this dominating female energy by being very aggressive and masculine. I can't quite imagine (yet) a situation where a capacity that she has becomes something that would inspire men to begin rebelling against the matriarchal stronghold on society and begin swinging the pendulum again toward masculine energy domination.

it was an interesting thought experiment for me :)

you know what would be really trippy? imagine there was another earth-like planet on the exact other side of the galaxy.. not all of the symbols in the sky would be exactly the opposite of the ones we have in the sky, so the energy would be interpreted differently but you could imagine that it would be very similar energy to the galactic energy we experience here (the great year), but 180° out of phase.

you could imagine then, over there something similar where I would be a little boy that got an early start of life like andrea did here... another interesting thought experiment I enjoyed.


### 2019-01-10 09:06 - the cosmic nosedive

so, in my quest to try and figure out what's going on, this is my latest theory:

when fwh said I had until 2038, I think that was the current record for longest nosedive (continual contrast).

the reason why I think that is so is because my life has never been about the manifestation. one of the most common things I got said about tuenti was people telling me how successful they were at hooking up with the site. I always told them I'm glad it's working for them. what I'm trying to say is that I have never had a "success" in my life where the success was what I was looking for. I have always found what I was looking for inside of me.

I have also noticed my life energy increasing over the years and especially in multiples of 11, and 2038 is when I turn 55.

so, last night I mentioned that likely when I turn 36 there will be another increase in energy and the previous entry @[entry](2019-01-09 04:15) was to make sure they were prepared enough to keep me from the manifestation.

so, here's why I think it's important to keep me from the manifestation: I think I'm so high energy now (post 33) that whenever a manifestation happens now it's sort of hard for me to be contained. things probably get too extreme too quickly, cause what I'm really looking for is to come into alignment with myself.

in fact, I think I'm so high energy that it probably takes a bit for me to get up to speed with who I really am. I have to get a pretty serious running start in order to not have things get way out of control when the energy hits. it seems that this sort of energy has numerous other energies that precede it in time, kind of like to begin preparing the path for its arrival.

so, just for round numbers, let's imagine that 100 years is the time limit I would have to fully get into alignment with myself. every 11 years, the energy takes a big step up and I have to be ready for that.

here's where the nosedive comes into play: like I mentioned in a previous entry, constant contrast will be an exponentially accelerating acceleration, so the duration of time I'm on this planet I've got to maintain contrast (nosedive) for as long as possible without a manifestation. that way, when I die, and the energetic effect I had on the planet is taken away, the planet also plunges into the dark ages and does its own nosedive.

the recession of energy and the following nosedive creates such strong desire for my return so that light can be restored. what I can't figure out is why it would be that people would want me to return so that light can be restored, but probably it's the best way to create that strong desire.

each time, I fight with the rulers of the earth, making them stronger each time, because eventually they will be able to provide such downward force (contrast) that when I finally come into alignment with who I really am, I'm actually ready and things don't get super crazy.

so, it's probably true that my time here will only increase the male dominator energy as I fight against it -- and one day perhaps they'll be able to actually contain me long enough for me to actually come into alignment with who I really am here in the physical.

---

so, I think this message is positive because it helps me to understand why I feel that it's good that they're keeping me from the manifestation, yet at the same time I feel the need to continue to try and move toward what it is I want (coming into alignment with myself) at all cost.

the great thing is, now that I'm conscious of what is happening, so I can fight them constantly to keep up the contrast and make sure they're constantly improving their capability to limit me, so they don't drop the ball and some sort of manifestation happens.

so, I know now that I have to push hard so they keep pushing back, but not too hard that I get a manifestation, but not too soft that they lighten up and a manifestation happens, either.

it's good because now I know what to do, and I can have fun with it... we've yet to find the peak of the male dominator energy :)

---

so, I'm sorry you guys are on this voyage with me. if you don't like it, you know, you create your own reality, so really any manifestation that you want is available to you. I personally will never see it from my perspective, and that's because I'm in the process of creating my own reality (coming into alignment with who I am) which isn't a determining factor in any reality you create.

so prepare for the most. epic. nosedive. ever. :D hopefully I can last the the entire time without a manifestation as this human body gets faster and faster energy in preparation for coming into alignment with who I really am. that may be a bit of a long-shot, so for now I'll just set the goal of a new record of 33 or 44 years (2049 or 2070).

imagine my other theory about the parent universe bso and them running this universe inside of my head in the parent universe... obviously, they don't want me to get the manifestation either, so they want to ensure present day bso maintains control and keeps me from the manifestation. we all want the same thing, in the end.


### 2019-01-10 14:12 - all you do is create chaos, kenny

one of the reactions I felt this morning was the idea that I create a whole bunch of chaos.

I could see how that could be perceived, but if you step back for a moment and take a look at things without listening to the thoughts in my head or anything else, I'm not really creating chaos. for example, I go to take a walk, go to watch stars, look at the sun, etc. none of these is creating any chaos at all. it's only people's chaotic reactions to me that's creating the chaos. I'm not the one ordering hundreds of airplanes to spray a bunch of crap in the sky or pumping the ionosphere full of electricity to make it hard for me to see the stars. don't blame me for your chaotic reactions to my (in my opinion) normal activity.

---

next, I was thinking about the different things I learned a few days ago in a weird series of dreams. I had a bunch of dreams about nosebook and all of that. I kept getting woken up, and I would go back to sleep and the dream would continue where I left off. this happened prolly 8-9 times. then, in another dream I ran(!) to go find mom to tell her about my dream sequence. I told her about the dreams but they probably realised I was conscious in the dream because they woke me up.

I looked around to find out I had just woken up, only to marvel at how normal and exactly like real-life the dream felt to me. I guess the running bit should have alerted me to the fact that I was dreaming (cause I can't run in real-life).

anyway, while thinking about this whole creation of chaos thing, I was noting how DMT makes things feel very normal. the way that my eyes see feels so normal to me, I can't actually imagine what it would be like to see any less. I can only hope to be able to see more, yet for other people my eyesight is probably a very mind-blowing experience. the same thing in the dream experience... the most bizarre stuff can be happening in the dream, and it feels normal to me.

since the normalisation of the mind-blowing is what DMT does to the mind, I think there is another unseen effect happening, where there are people so amped up on DMT that their lives are so bizarre, but they don't even notice it (just like a dream). so, you have all of these people trying to steer my life for me, completely oblivious to the fact that their own are spinning way out of control.


### 2019-01-10 23:10 - maybe redirect the energy instead of trying to fight against it?

I had an idea earlier which goes something like this: I imagine that they are siphoning energy out of my body and dissipating it into the ground. now, if you think about it, this could be the reason why I have such a strong effect on the climate -- especially when I move. when you think about a charged body moving across a surface, it'll generate static electricity. I've been walking a lot more and I notice a *HUGE* difference in how I feel when I'm moving and when I'm not. I think this has to do with the circuit that is created between me and the earth. I also sleep on the floor, and I noticed a huge difference too when I sleep on the couch. or, for example, if I want the clouds to clear up I just go and lay on the ground outside. there is a clear connection that I have with the earth that has a notable effect on the climate.

so, instead of trying to fight against all of the energy I'm creating, and at the same time generating a whole lot of energy to run other people's imaginations or put images in their eyes, why not just reuse the energy you siphon off of me for that?

or, even better, you could sink the energy into other people's heads instead of having to run everyone's brain's at a million miles an hour to create the DMT necessary to see images in their mind at my visual quality.

this whole redistribution of energy idea is something that seems like a good idea to me because I noticed the reaction to the potential question I wrote for the @[abe](2019-06-01) workshop -- and the devices are not presently creating more desire for more energy. well, maybe it is actually. maybe the earth likes my energy and is generating desire for me to make more of it. the more energy I make, the more energy the earth receives from me.

the same would be true if my energy were to be put into other people's brains. I would imagine that they would feel pretty good and smarter with it. so, the same would be true with the analogy abraham made of the ex-wife summoning more resources for the man, the same would happen here too. the more people feel good and enjoy the energy that they take from me, the more they would summon, the more I would make -- and everyone would feel a whole lot better. it's also something you could sell.

additionally, instead of having to continually push harder and harder against me, you just dissipate more energy into more people (or the earth). it actually works out better, and would explain why I feel so good about the idea of trying to achieve a 40 year nosedive.

I suppose it may seem like a bad idea now, I just was thinking this morning that with the present techniques in place, there's no way you guys are going to be able to keep away my visual capacity until the end of this year. presently, it's literally effortless for me to see images: all I have to do is to meditate even a little bit, so you're going to have to come up with a better way shortly. so, I believe maybe in some time you may want to give it some thought.

additionally, regarding the fear that when I die that energy will go away... I mean I don't have anything to back this idea up, but I imagine that children produce a lot of energy too. the same mechanism could be used to siphon off their energy to keep the dinosaurs alive. I mean you're already neck deep in freeloading off of others to do what you don't feel/want to do yourself -- so why not just double down on it. same thing for the kids... like me, they'll just find ways of making more energy.


### 2019-01-11 13:31 - earth's twin and dominance hierarchies

so, I've been playing around with that thought experiment with another earth-like planet on the other side of the galaxy quite a bit, and I'll be writing more about it because as I reverse the symbols and let the thing play out, I notice what emerges is very much the same thing: the realisation of the individual.

whether it's the hight of female dominator energy or masculine dominator energy, what ends up emerging is an individual that says, you guys go prove your dominance to those who care; I'm going to do my own thing.

> dominance - an imposed external recognition of one's own value

I actually want to kind of write a bigger thing (more than just a blurb like this) about how I perceive this opposite earth, because I really find the scenes that play out in my mind to be quite illuminating.

I might even make it into a full kind of "production" in the sense that there are characters, a storyline, and interactions that kind of illustrate the idea it in a more visual way. it would be mostly symbolic, a kind of like homer's illiad.

I'll play with the idea a bit more


### 2019-01-11 18:43 - triangle of control

the other day I was playing with this idea of self-control, and depending on the perspective, the common aspect is that I/he is uncontrollable. I thought this was interesting because no one would ever say I want to be out of control or I want him to be out of control -- or, I want to lose control, or I want him to lose control. here are some transformations on the idea.

[imperative / desire]
I want to be controlled        <-> I want to control him.
I want to follow his commands  <-> I want him to follow my commands
I want to be controlled        <-> I want him to be controlled

[observation / conclusion]
I have self-control            <->  I have to control him
I have to follow my own orders <->  he's out of control
I have to be uncontrollable    <->  he's uncontrollable

if you look at the last line in both, it sticks out as something different from the rest. I'd like to revisit this topic more in the future, because I think the key to my understanding this concept lies in that that last line. also, I believe they may be better visualised as tetrahedrons instead of triangles. I need another transformation to add the extra dimension.


### 2019-01-18 00:48 - going a tope

I had an interesting conversation with gary today about getting paid. he wants me to be on payroll and not pay me cash. it's obvious that this is a directive coming from the guys manipulating things. it feels to me like maybe they want me to not have weed during the eclipse and and trying to delay the whole thing. or, maybe they want to force me to "do everything by the books".

either way, it doesn't feel good to me. it feels like it'll make me get stuck. I was mulling it over on the walk home and the best reason I can come up with is I'm content right now just making this thing. I do not really consider myself to me a person that enjoys spreadsheet programming. in fact, I probably would really like to be creating something really "amazing" or maybe even something that interests me. I don't really have a whole lot of interests right now, so accomplishing things in spreadsheet programming is... something. it's kind of a lame excuse I'm using right now to feel good.

so, in a sense the "payment" I'm receiving from the work is the sense of accomplishment and the good feeling I get from actually making something (even if it's a boring spreadsheet). therefore, if I were to receive money for it, I'm now no longer doing it just cause I want to do it. that good feeling is gone and it's a job now; now, I'm getting some sort of compensation for my work in the form of money which I now have to turn into a good feeling.

---

I cannot think of anything that I would want to purchase right now if I had money, other than drugs. the reason for this is, money doesn't make me feel independent. no matter how much of it I have nosebook is still going to be making my sleep awful. if I have a car, the only thing I would do is use it to try and and outrun the clouds so I can watch stars.

money does nothing for me. drugs are where it's at for me because the thing that I want more than anything is unlimited access *TO MY OWN MIND*. I want to see the images, hear the voices, make the music, meet the strangers in my head, and discover new limits to human consciousness.

so, forget weed man. I'm just going to focus real hard, keep powering up with the stars cause it forces me to utilise the power of my focus and direction of energy, instead of trying to utilise physical means to discover what is actually on the inside of me.

I don't really want to drive a car, because I'll just try to escape the clouds to watch stars instead of improving my focus and affecting the climate with my mind. I'd also much rather fly. so pffft, not gonna do that.

also, instead of slowing myself down with weed (I've been wanting to take a break for quite a while now), I'm just going to increase my focus to thn point where I'm actually in control of my energy in a way that I can instead jump right toward ketamine, shrooms, and mdma.

---

I'm just going to keep working on this for the fun of making something. he has no choice but to not pay me. it's what I want, it keeps my away from "drugs" for now, and he won't pay me in cash either, so I guess yeah... no break, increase focus and achieve all those things instead with the power of my focus :)

peace out, chumps


### 2019-01-18 01:12 - clocks and the egoista

today I felt to make a comment about how I really liked how raquel, first thing she did without consulting me or anything was to just take all the clocks down from the wall. I particularly disliked their sound, but since no one I have ever met gets annoyed by the ticking of a clock, I just have learned to put up with it. after reaching some point of frustration I probably would have took them down, but she did that right away and I thought that was really cool.

anyway, immediately following that comment, I had a newish thought (I think it popped up once before) about a theory that in a another timeline raquel and I did quite well together, and I find it very probable that we/I would have discovered star watching on the terrace roof, because that was my favourite thing about the roof. I was just far to drunk every night to ever see the stars in any clear capacity.

anyway, it seems to me that there is mounting evidence that every single relationship that could have formed had a sudden plot twist that seemed to change the course of the relationship.

---

raquel always called me egoista much before I became conscious of it. I just thought that was normal and you were supposed to have a really positive self-image. so, it seemed that I really liked raquel, and at the same time she stuck me in a network where I would find myself in the most difficult of a situation to remain an egoista.

I had some trouble getting to this point, yet now, I find it invigorating that *literally* the entire world is working against my strong desire of self-realisation. so, just watch me as I power up and gain strength, because it's gonna feel so good to show everyone the most extreme definition of egoista humankind has ever seen.

I may have liked her, but in the end I just wanted to prove my strength and greatness to the entire world, and she was the was the fastest way for me to attract that kind of situation.

just watch: I'm going to make lucifer's nosedive look like child's play :D


### 2019-01-18 07:26 - of course I'm settin' myself up for failure...

pretty good setup, right?


### 2019-01-19 05:46 - table flipping jesus

I have, on more than one occasion criticised jesus overturning the tables in the temple, saying that I thought it was a lousy publicity stunt to make him more favourable in the non-religious people's eyes.

well, when I was watching stars tonight, I felt like one of the reactions was a sort of question like what will he do when he gets access to his inner universe. how will he react to what he finds, and that's when I was reminded of this overturning the tables scenario.

you see, every particle of the universe and every quantifiable thing has both wanted and unwanted. it's impossible to separate the two because the definition of "wanted" is in the eye of the beholder of it.

the reaction you will get from me will likely be one more in the line of over-analysis. I observe and over-analyse everything. I'll probably interpret them as a visual realisation of your desires and try to figure out what sorts of desire would cause such visualisations to exist.

I don't believe that I would necessarily reject it and try to throw it out of the temple, in that sense, because like I said, it's not possible to separate the unwanted from the wanted... that's where I would come to the analysis of how it came to be and why it's considered something wanted.

being a sensitive person living in a society with a lot of different things going on, I've acquired a pretty good handle on tuning into only the things that interest me. that's why I don't really watch tv, and when I do, I'm more often perplexed as to why what I'm seeing is interesting to people -- same with facebook.

---

so, that inspired thought about what could be my potential downfall: what could I make the mistake of doing which garners me more favourability in the eyes of the public. I think I'm generally in a pretty good spot though because I'm so self-absorbed. I'm not really trying to get anyone's approval.

the one thing that I'm very keen on, is giving anyone who wants it, access to knowledge and the tools one would want to expand their own mind.. this may be the "publicity stunt" which is my "downfall" -- as it's something that I want, and I know it's not necessarily what everyone else wants. maybe it's similar to having root access on your mobile device, and giving the entire world root access to their mobile devices (or brain) is not ideal. I don't know. though, it could also be like how the catholic church prevented people from reading religious texts and studying the human body.

---

I just had an idea: in the religious form of controlling perception, you are made to believe that you are broken to begin with (original sin) and headed toward damnation if you didn't get your sins pardoned. money was the form with which you could do that, and the church set out to become the most economically endowed organisation.

we are heading toward abundance though, so economic control will no longer be feasible, so I think the new economics is superiority. they will need to erect different systems which train the person to believe they are inferior to begin with, and then some sort of measurement will be created to allow a bunch of people who are taught to believe they are inferior, have a method by which they can reverse their inferiority by gaining superiority.

in order to have such a system, the person must be denied access to their own superiority. on a mobile device, only those who can obtain root access can perform any operation. I think this is the model that will be used for our brains now, where you become a limited capability user of your body and brain. those with superiority are superior because they can access more of the capabilities of their body / brain.

I'll have to think about it more, but I believe that most people do not actually want full capability of their body / brain. it likely really bothers these guys with the superiority complex that I can see better than they can, and there's no easy way for them to see at that quality, that while holding those they believe to be inferior at a lower visual quality (so they can feel superior).

eg. it's likely that the reason why they ensure my vision is so blurry, is only because they can't handle the thought that mine is superior to theirs, and they cannot pay enough money or force enough things into place to make that different.

this needs more thought... I suppose.

(the way that I arrived to the superiority idea is both noticing the way the guys in charge react to things -- the way they need to maintain control/superiority over everyone -- and how much it pisses them off, that I'm so egoista. they want so badly to make me feel inferior to them... and, because they need to prove their superiority, just shows they do not actually believe their own superiority, perceiving themselves to be inferior (to me)... so, just as all chains of command or power work, it is necessary to accumulate others less power to feel superior to them)

is superiority is the new economics and capability is the new currency?

I have been put in the most inferior position, yet it's helped me to acquire a self-image of extreme capability (not superiority).

that emphasis on capability is very important, I think, because capability comes from self, and superiority requires others. additionally, you only have to want capability and then convince yourself that you have it, to be able to get it. conversely, you will need to convince a whole lot of people, jump through enough hoops, or maybe have a noticeable physical advantage to acquire your superiority.

capability is so much easier to obtain, but it may be possible that you will convinced you need to pay something to get it. don't believe it. believe in yourself.


### 2019-01-19 13:33 - money and value as a simile to (???) and capability

most of this thought was brought about as an extension of my attempts to explain to gary why I did not want to be paid. I had to think and reason about how we value things. so, to explain a little better what I was meaning involving capability becoming the new currency in the economy of superiority, think of money as the metric by which we value things.

just like capability, one's own value is found within. every person is inherently valuable in their own perception (that's why you remain living), and so what we have done is create a monetary system by which we can measure and exchange valuable things.

so in my example to gary yesterday, if you have three identical things and they are all offered to you by different people: one of them is a gift: it's free. the other he asks $1 in exchange for the object, and the last asks $100. let's say the item's value at the store is $120, so you would automatically think to yourself that the $100 is new quality. the $1 must be defective, and you may not put a value on the free item, because it was free. the free item has more "meaningful" value associated with it, and the other's quality/value is derived from the measurement of the requested dollar amount.

there are in fact infinite different scenarios to which you can imagine the perceived value of identical things. this process of making something to have more perceived value is marketing and advertising.

well, the same thing I think is going to begin happening in this coming era where capability becomes the new currency. one's own value is something that is self-realised. so, to control this new valuation of the person, we were disempowered with original sin, hell, and other misinterpretations to believe that we are not valuable to begin with, and your value is something that must be measured, earned, accumulated, and exchanged with a monetary system.

I find it likely that a similar thing will happen, where some new metric will be made to which you can redeem your incapability, and earn or pay to have your inherent capability.

I think this is where I was trying to get to when I was talking to mom the other day when I was saying that I really did not like the whole death of jesus bit. and now, I'm realising that the part that bothers me is that we're taught that he *paid the price* for our sins by dying on the cross. and so, because of his death, now (and only since then) can we can begin to believe own own inherent value, no longer needing to pay the church to erase your *debts*, and let them be forgiven.


### 2019-01-19 14:52 - a new device and the answer to last night's question

so, last night I posed the question about what could be my overturning of the tables.. then proceeded to write about capability. well, right after that I went to sleep and while I was asleep, they installed a new device in the right side of my nose. my initial reaction would be to respond in anger and destroy something of value for greg, like his computer.

like overturning the tables, that would not result in any change in them at all. they will continue to install devices in me while I'm asleep to try and limit my capability.

so then, if you get what you think about, you could say that I attracted the new device by writing about it. however, I'm sure they planned the installation before I had wrote about it (which is why the train kept honking at me, to go to sleep). so then, was my discourse on capability a reaction to their plans? meaning, if I hadn't of wrote it, would some set of events occur such that they would be unable again to make the installation?

I don't know. it seems all connected. so, maybe it wasn't a publicity stunt but actually a reaction in anger just like mine would have been.

instead, I will show them how much stronger belief in, or knowledge of one's own capability is, than any amount of devices they could have installed.


### 2019-01-19 - capability vs. superiority

there are many auto mechanics that believe they can fix anything -- and the majority of them can, just as they believe it to be. this is belief in one's own capability -- however, when one asks who is the *best* auto mechanic, now it becomes a question of superiority, and there can be only one. one must measure capability and appeal to the to the judges to determine who has the superiority. it's the judges, of course; they are the most superior cause they're the ones doing the measuring.

many can have capability, but only one can have superiority. your capability is not diminished by other's capability either.

to give another example, there are lots of programmers who believe they can program anything (myself included), so for them, the question then becomes, where to focus that energy. the more programmers that believe they can program anything they set their mind to, the better. all the inferior programmers (cause they believe themselves to be) are the ones trying to keep up with the latest trends because they don't believe in their own capability to arrive at the result they're looking for.

imagine trying to determine who is the "best" programmer. it would be such a contrived task to measure such a thing, you'd only be measuring the programmer's capacity within metric. I say this because we had to give "programming tests" to potential hires when working for tuenti, and it was such bullshit, such complete rubbish, that made no meaningful reflection of a programmer's capability.

I hate to admit it, but I the feeling I get from those programming tests is one of a contrived sense of superiority given by the people currently employed as a way of seeing of someone can measure up to some bullshit metric the guy in charge has of what a "good" programmer can do... it could be a reaction to erik's nonsense, but I remember having read quite a few hacker news (of all places) comments about the inviability of using a contrived programming test as a meaningful way to determine a potential hire's capability. I'm done ranting now; sorry about that :)


### 2019-01-20 00:03 - back to value -- where did it come from?

while in the shower earier today I was thinking about the past symbols leading up to the monetary system of value we have today.

obviously, before pieces of precious metals were used as an intermediate token of value, only barter was made. if you wanted sheeps and you have goats, you hope the guy with extra sheeps wants goats in exchange for his sheeps. this didn't work very well. the concept of currency as a token of value makes exchange of goods a much more streamlined process, so it's quite obvious why it was adopted.

before money though, if you wanted to show that you had abundance, you would throw one of your best sheep on an altar and light it on fire -- kind of like a way of showing you don't give a fuck because you have more than enough. nowadays, you could blow a few grand in a disco buying bottles to show the same thing.

---

I believe the moon was more aligned with the earth before venus came into contact with the earth (something you can read about in velakovski's worlds in collision) throwing off the nar perfect alignment and making our year 365 (instead of 360) days. so, for example right now we are between an eclipse pair. the second one will be tomorrow. this means that the moon is more aligned with the sun than normal (otherwise if the moon were exactly perfectly aligned, we would have an eclipse twice a month, every new and full moon). I can clearly feel that in moments of greater alignmnt like these or during the equinoxes (when the earth's tilt most closely aligns with the poles of the sun), there is more energy moving and LOA seems to stronger.

so, I postulate that in times previous to venus' interaction with the earth, LOA was in fact quite a bit stronger because of the extra solar and lunar energy. in an energetically heightened environment like that, you would get a whole lot more of what you think about.

to the primitive person, this may seem like there is some sort of strong external force acting on things. many gods were created to explain this craziness, and instead of making the connection that lackful thinking or focus on limitation was actually the reason why their crops were not growing, they thought it was external and had something to do with the gods... however, somehow someone figured out that burning livestock like it doesn't matter to you, somehow seemed to make you have more abundance. the gods must love burnt sheep they figured, and that must be how to appease them.

this, I think is the original meaning of the word "sacrifice".

---

now, have a look at moses in the exodus (when venus interacted with the earth), where the sacrificial lamb was placed over the door so that the angel of death knew to skip that house. again, I think this is an action that was given to the isrealites by moses so that they could believe in some sort of miracle. they had not yet realised that you get what you think about, and if you look out and see all the chaos venus is creating with its close approach to earth, you attract more chaos and destruction. however, if you do something extraordinary which allows you to believe that this chaos will not affect you, now you're thinking that the chaos will pass you by, and so that is what happens.

I haven't quite fit everything all together here, but I think that what elijah changed in the era of sacrifice (aries), is the notion that the animal does not make the difference, but your belief that makes all the difference. you'll notice that elijah's altar did not have an animal, and was covered in water. he was proving that it is your belief that makes the difference, not the action.

in next age of value (pisces), gutenburg / luther made a similar change in the structure of value by allowing people to begin discovering their own value through reading. this was the beginning of the spread of information, and opened the channels of communication.

I believe that just like communication cycles between hot and cold (as illustrated by mcluhan), the eras begin in the imagination and then gradually move toward communication. so for example, previous to elijah, the understanding of how LOA worked, was based entirely in the imagination of these imaginary gods that needed to be appeased. after elijah, the prophets began to change this process toward something which could be communicated: and so the prophets began to write and make prophecies, which people then believed -- so they came to pass.

similarly the church held back all of the knowledge externalising it from the person. (something that jesus was always saying that you have it within ... so no need to look externally). so, when the gutenburg press and martin luther (the protestant movement) began to take this value and put it into the hands of the people by allowing information and thought to expand because of rapid spread and diversification of new ideas. for further development on this concept, see "understanding media" by mcluhan.

---

back to the sacrifice. unfortunately, I'm pretty sure jesus believed that some sort of sacrifice would need to be made to allow for the abundance of people to begin believing in their own value. so, when he sees trinkets being sold as a gimmick to allow someone to believe something, he sees it as a step in the wrong direction, going back toward moses, and undoing the progress made by elijah.

I think that's why he often said something similar to (not an exact quote), "oh ye of little faith! why must you need symbols and signs to believe" -- all you have you do is to believe! you alone are valuable enough to allow it to come to pass; you don't need all of these symbols, signs, trinkets, and other crap to be able to believe. you are capable.

this entry is dedicated to aaron. he helped me connect a lot of these ideas together. word up :)


### 2019-01-20 01:33 - our backward perception of the utility of communication and imagination

I find it interesting the backwardedness of our understanding of communication and imagination: most people use their imaginations as a means of understanding and rerealising the external, physical things. also, communication is thought to be a means by which we can control the external, when really communication is to allow for the spread of ideas, something which enriches the internal. I perceive both of these as a means of enriching the internal, yet it seems that the way things have progressed, there has been significant effort to try and control and keep people's communication and imagination externally focused.


### 2019-01-21 07:28 - paying attention to my energy

after watching stars for a bit I came in because it got too cloudy to see the stars and began to listen to a mix on the sofa. there was some time missing but I didn't think much of it, however my personality changed quite a bit: all of a sudden I was frustrated and I didn't want to do gary's stuff any more. I went off on a bit of a tirade and also I remember my left hand hurt quite a bit.

later on, for some reason I decided to listen to the mix again, and noticed that I had a very different perception of it. I seemed to remember the mix being a lot better, so that must mean they must put me in the dream-like state where everything feels good.

anyway, I became conscious when they put this diamond pattern in my eyes (like I saw one other time when trying to watch one of jeremiah's sts runs and they ripped my consciousness away in the middle of it), so that must be when they reset my vision back to being blurry again. they must determine how clear the lines look and make them just distorted enough to ensure I have "normal" human vision.

what I find most interesting is, they seem to want me to operate at an very low energy level, which basically means I don't have any motivation at all. however, I refuse to do things that I don't feel like doing. the reason is because I like going fast and doing something I don't feel like doing always spells disaster for me, so I just have a rule that I don't do things I don't feel like doing.

when I do feel like doing things, I get a lot done really quickly and I'm very productive. I also feel pretty good too. I think my feeling good is one of the reasons for the recent vision upgrades, too.

I think these guys are used to doing things they don't want to do, and expect me to do the same. they probably also feel pretty miserable all the time (because they're doing things they don't want to do). I can't imagine what it would be like to do so many things I don't want to do. if I had to do that, I would probably be a very heavy coke user to try and offset the misery.

instead of trying to do something that I don't want to do, I simply won't. I see no reason to take action when it doesn't feel good. in fact, all of my life, I have been rewarded if I don't take action on something that doesn't feel good. the times that I have forced myself to do something that didn't feel good, *never* (let me repeat that..) *never* turned out well.

so, I don't do things when I don't feel well or when the thing doesn't feel good either. good luck trying to figure out how to force me to do something I don't want to do and have it not look like slavery :P


### 2019-01-21 07:59 - some responses to reactions to my last entry

1. we've seen you not want to do something, then you were able to do it.

I didn't force myself to do it; that would have been disastrous. instead, I found a way of wanting to do it.

2. we all have to do things we don't want to do.

maybe *you* believe that you do, but I create my own reality. so, I focus on the things that I *want* to do, they come to me, and I have fun doing them. maybe *you* might look at some of the things I do, (like for example wake up early and sit out in the cold staring at a star) and say that is not something you would want to do. you may even think that I might not want to do it either, and I'm forcing myself to do it. this is not, however, the case. I really want to have my visual capacity, and I really want to see clearly -- more than I want to be warm or to be sleeping. it's a question of stronger desire. there are many times I say forget it to the stars because I want more to sleep or whatever.

3. no kenny, you can not do any thing that you want. we create your reality by determining what we want for you and steering you toward that.

sounds good bro. I suppose it'll be interesting to see how that works out for you. if you want my advice, stick to creating your own reality.


### 2019-01-21 09:00 - the unresisted state

my last entry spawned some thought, and one of the things I mentioned is how I have a rule of not doing something I don't want to do because it doesn't yield good results.. well, I also have a rule about not lying -- for the same reason: it doesn't yield good results for me.

so I was thinking about how I have noticed that in my dream state, it seems that things feel good, so I'm capable of doing things I don't want to do (like help the nosebook guys or answer their questions). the reason for this is, since there is no resistance, there's no consequence. and so, at the same time I have also noticed with reactions that I tend to lie in my unresisted state -- probably for the same reason: there's no consequence, cause there's no resistance. however for people without those rules, I imagine in their dream state, they cannot do things they don't want to do (probably produce nightmares) and so only feel the freedom to do things they want to do. likewise, in an unresisted state, I imagine it's near to impossible for people without that rule to lie in their unresisted state either -- because there's no resistance anymore to telling the truth (so telling the truth feels the most freedom)

a little bit ago I lied on purpose to mom cause she asked me what I was thinking about when she clearly knew the answer, because I was having an internal monologue about the guys in charge of nosebook's antics. I said I was thinking about taking a walk. which was true, cause it was the thing I had thought of before going off on my tirade. and, I did notice a shift in the energy after that; not one that I liked, so I'm sticking to not lying, cause it feels best to me, unless it's talking to mom about some tirade I'm on, which has more resistance than lying.

always path of least resistance for me. which makes me wonder what sorts of awful questions they're asking me in my dream state which lying is less resistant path... lol


### 2019-01-21 09:50 - the reason why things look taller...

after a vision upgrade, I have often noted that things look taller to me. well, today when I figured out the diamond pattern, I understood that it was a fix to the previous thing I experienced which was after the vision upgrade things would look smaller to me, then when they put in their processed image, things looked increasingly closer to me. this is because the eye sees in a parabolic shape, and every vision upgrade the distance between pixels decreases, but not evenly from upgrade to upgrade. so, as time goes on, if they keep increasing the number of pixels at a constant rate, then put that image into my eyes, the objects look increasingly closer and closer, like a convex mirror (the bubble ones that allow you to see around corners).

the solution to that is to project a diamond pattern into my eyes, and adjust the image until the lines are straight. this will give the proper spacing between the pixels (cause you have more pixels toward the center of the eye than on the edges). this also likely has something to do with why I have almost zero peripheral vision while they are projecting the image into my eye and then the few times the device has shut off, the most notable change is I regain peripheral vision (and some other things).

anyway, back to why things look taller... so, the obvious reason now why things look taller to me after a vision upgrade is because I see in 3d, and in 3d, things closer to me appear taller than things further away. the diamond pattern will give them the correct spacing of the pixels on a 2d plane, but in 3d, it smooshes everything flat.

in order to solve this, their machines will need to understand the space between the things: if you think of what you see, your eye looks out in a cone shape, and all light coming into your eye is a straight line. eg. you cannot see behind something.

however, my eyes perceive the light, not the surface, in that I can also see from where the light came from too (the bounce of the bounce). this allows me to see the "space in-between" two things.

---

you can extrapolate this concept out a little further and know that the more bounces my eyes become capable of seeing, the more of the scene I can become conscious of. additionally, our bodies radiate light, and a good example of this is a person that just had sex: they seem more radiant. combine the light the person emits, with the capability of seeing more than 3-4 bounces, and that person would become capable of perceiving theirself as along with everything else around them. (the space between)

coming soon... :)

for now though, it looks like their machines are not capable of this yet, so likely you'll only be able to see that when directly connecting to me, and not looking back in a saved experience. it also seems that they prefer me to *not* see the space in-between, so I'm driven to continually go for more and more visual upgrades. I imagine they're going to get a whole lot easier now that I know what I'm looking for.

P.S. greg and mitch: look up a few entries where I spoke about the unresisted state. I want to add another thing to that, which is, for a person who has all of their thoughts broadcasted, saying my goals is not the path of least resistance. instead, it's the path of least allowing. for me, the path of most allowance is to state my goals upfront, and let these guys push against them. I'll let you guys figure out how the path of most resistance for me is actually the path of most allowance :) (hence why I stated the extrapolation of the space in-between -- precisely so these guys will push against it)


### 2019-01-25 22:19 - everything seems hard to me right now.

I'm really having a difficult time in the sense that no matter what, I can't really seem to find any motivation to do anything, most everything feels overwhelming to me right now, and I'm really reeling quite insecure about my mental capability. although I can grasp and follow along with really complicated ideas (as expressed in the recent entry about the transition toward capability), I find myself struggling with really simple things like multiplication and arithmetic.

I seem to be capable of releasing resistance still quite easily, as it seems to be getting easier and easier for me to gain visual upgrades from the stars. in the past when I reach a stuck place like this, I just smoke weed and I'm back on track.

however, this time though, I don't have strong desire to smoke. it seems like it's the thing I should be doing, I really really don't want to get stuck in a rut where I'm just doing the minimal amount of work just to buy the weed, because then I'm sort of just wasting time or something not productive and I want to be productive I want to be moving and going. so, I know that weed isn't what I want to do right now, but I don't really know what it is I want to do, either.

I had this moment when I first started up with gary where I noticed that not only was the writing of the program to do the thing he wanted going to be easy, but also it seemed like a pretty easy thing to sell carports, and potentially a lot of commission that could be earned. I was feeling good about the whole thing because it seemed like for once things began to get easy again, and for me everything I've failed at was hard, and all things I've had success at were easy. and, even though I always put in long hours for those easy, the work seemed to be just a steady continuous transition from one thing to another.

now though, when I look at gary's work, it doesn't interest me at all. the easy bit was only the thing that got me thinking it was the right way -- however, now I am only realising that I don't want to have anything to do with money. I don't want to be involved in any of this sales or business stuff whatsoever.

I don't even want to work on electronics either, and I cannot find any desire in me to program any more either. just two weeks ago I was content writing a spreadsheet application, and I could feel good about my accomplishment there, but now I don't even have that any more. it would be typical of me to blame nosebook, because it does seem that since the eclipse, I have not been able to find any desire any more, and if they had anything to do with it, is actually irrelevant because I don't feel bad really at all, and I'm continuing to see improvement in my vision too so I'm still releasing resistance without a problem, so there's no real problem.

that's the problem: there's no identifiable problem. yet, physically for example, I'm noticing increasing difficulty to pee (much more than normal), so it seems there is a problem. a physical manifestation like that is always evidence of an emotional disturbance. I can't find the emotional problem at it's root.

as I'm writing this, I'm feeling around kind of trying to figure it out for myself. the only thing that came to my mind though is that perhaps I've gotten so used to not relaxing. since the eclipse I've slept a very large amount, yet I'm still tired.

I also feel like I'm getting a more serious case of a split personality, because on one hand, it feels like I'm going to be doing the world's most epic nosedive, which is fine for me, and on the other hand, it have more confidence than ever that this whole situation was attracted by me in the first place as a by-product of my giant sense of self-worth and capability, that there's no way for to not get my visual capacity. sometimes I even feel like I have this second sadistic second nature to me that could overcome my present circumstances without very much effort at all, but is also self-limiting (just like my anti-desire to go for an easy solution of smoking or girls or whatever) and is actually stringing the nosebook guys along like a cat does to a mouse before eating it. I can't figure out who is me and why am I helping them along.

additionally, I have a growing sense that all of this latent frustration and "hardening of my heart" is actually rooted in many long frustrating interrogations in dream-state where I have steadily shed my child-like innocence and and really took them for quite a ride. the inner hatred and frustration is only beginning to bubble to the surface much like a happens to a child as it begins to enter puberty.

however, it doesn't seem to be "reactionary" like a child does. it feels pre-meditated, because I'm beginning to make a transition where I'm doing less and less thinking inside of my brain. I don't exist, so much like I used to inside of my body. *we* exist as a frequencial response. it feels like a long series of chain reactions, and similar such reactions that have existed in the past, too. I don't want to admit it, but it sounds like that thing I always make fun of -- the inequities of the fathers and the forefathers and generations backward.

this is clearly a "sober" thought of mine, as I'm not capable of that kind of thought while I'm stoned; I think that stuff is hilarious. I think it's so hilarious that it makes people serious about it very uncomfortable. maybe, it feels like I've snapped again, almost as if to say, ok, you wanna take this stuff seriously? we're gonna take this really really seriously and then we'll see.

I can't quite conceptualise it. that's just what it feels like.

peace


### 2019-01-27 18:51 - the firstborn

earlier I was passing over my previous experience out at loaf n' jug with frank. anyway, when I came back I explained to mom how the part where he was being an asshole to the gas station attendant (john) was something I didn't enjoy. I mentioned that whenever zaryn gets around his friends he seems to need to prove how important, and how big of a deal he is, to them.

I was wondering why that is, and noah seems to me more similar to bill and zaryn seems very different from both of them. I've never met penny, so I'm missing a piece to that puzzle, but then I was reminded that I have often said that I am the realisation of what my mom would have been if she were a boy.

I thought about it a little more and perhaps this something that goes two ways... I don't really know any firstborn girls and their fathers, too. the closest thing I have is marcos and [marcos' oldest daughter can't remember her name]. I did notice quite a bit of similarity between the two.

I am going to propose the following theory for now:

> firstborn boys seem to be what the mom would be like if she were a boy.
> firstborn girls seem to be what the dad would be like if he were a girl.

the other day too, greg mentioned that he thinks of me as a firstborn prophet. so now I will generalise the theory and say:

> firstborn +vibrations seem to be what the originating -vibration would be it it were +
> firstborn -vibrations seem to be what the originating +vibration would be it it were -

so what is the vibrational opposite direction of a prophet? I don't know right now. it's certainly something worth thinking about.


### 2019-01-28 22:22 - who is more better?

sometimes I have these crazy ideas pass through my head. anyway, when I woke up this afternoon, I had this sense that there were some ideas put in my head that I should try and find some different girls to chill with, and they can make my life more ... better? or maybe I should work on some of that idea about the twin earth on the other side of the galaxy as a method of attracting that sort of thing to happen to me in this reality.

well, I strongly disagree in the sense that I feel very much that I want to do this myself. I don't want to depend on other things or other people to be doing it. if I wanted to depend on people, I'd just do the gary's employee thing and smoke weed until I was absolutely so sick of sitting around that I *had* to do something. that is a valid plan which I'm considering because I've learned since my last experience that weed isn't a bad thing for me -- actually, quite good. instead, I'm convinced it was the drinking that was the source of my lethargy. so realistically, I believe that there would be no problem if I just did the gary thing and smoked weed for a while.

in a previous entry, I said that maybe it's best to not have a break and to instead focus harder. I've been doing exactly that and have made quite some progress visually and also emotionally. so, I would say that focusing harder is actually working well, and I'm making significant improvement, however things like today happen when mom wants to force me to give her guardianship. which tells me that some people in charge feel that they are losing power over me and need to have someone they control (mom) gain power (guardianship) over me.

I dunno man, and then to complicate matters, for example tonight I went out of my way to grab mom's plate and put it in the dishwasher. then, I went out of my way to tell her about it too... I noted how strange this felt to me, because it would not have been my typical behaviour (I don't think).

so, who's putting these ideas in my head? where did the idea come from when I woke up about going to live with girls? where did the one about the plate come from?

I would like to "blame" my future self for the thoughts, but what if it's actually a few of the tech guys at the bso? what if they have some sort of interest in me doing... here's the idea: perhaps they have gone out of their way to program other triggers into the system to put ideas into my head (which I'm not resistant to), to make me more "well mannered".

in every situation I've been in, the most enlightening form of understanding is to trace interest. to whom does it interest that I have these thoughts? for example with the ones I had while waking up, it feels like tho common desperation that they're trying yet another angle to try and get me to depend on someone else to achieve something. obviously, it's never going to work because I have strong desire never to rely on someone else to do something for me which I feel I am *incapable* of achieving for myself.

---

I will be achieving my own visual capacity and coming into alignment with who I really am. I imagine it likely that the only way to do it will be to go up another dimension -- and once I do that, then I'm sure that I will be more than willing to engage in a lot more things than I currently am doing now. they will have to wait until then.

---

so then, after realising that there was this idea that these guys will, in their attempt to monetise the women, get their best hotshots to try and make this whole little girls thing happen. you can imagine that it is a common girl's dream to be able snag an attractive and notable man early on (maybe even important). so, that means that all they need to do is to find a way of making someone look attractive to these girls. LOA says it must be so: a girl that's looking to snag an attractive man early on because she's insecure or whatever, is on the same vibration as a guy who's looking to boost his attractiveness using some gimmick (like dream manipulation and thought triggers) to achieve something he didn't originally feel himself capable of achieving.

the source of this idea was actually taken from all my time reading the pua newsgroups back when pick-up artistry had not yet been destroyed yet by "the game" -- and in one very notable posting one of the main hotshots replied to a noob about the big picture. he essentially said that he figured out every way to manipulate any girl he wanted to sleep with him (he lived in LA), and that after conquering the whole thing he didn't find himself any more fulfilled. one of the tips is to not spend all of your time thinking and focusing on girls, but instead find a hobby or something that you enjoy and focus your time there, and it'll drive the women crazy that you have something more important than them. so, he continues on saying that in the end what he was actually looking for was that: something he really enjoys doing. you could pick up anyone you desired, but find something that makes you happy and do that -- dealing with a bunch of hot girl's bullshit to get some sweet hookups is not as fulfilling as you may think.

back on track here... so, now we're going to begin realising the real-life implementation to peak of male dominator energy as mentioned in @[entry](2019-01-09 04:15). you can imagine that this whole harvesting little girl's sexual energy by convincing them of something or boosting your attractiveness is just a big show, and at some point, the game will be understood. additionally, you can also imagine that adding that amount of extra energy to a person dependant on someone else for their pleasure, is a whole lot of extra energy -- and, there have been numerous individual cases (mostly rock-stars) where heightened amounts pleasure leads a person down a destructive road. you can read about this happening to an entire society in the "decline and fall of the roman empire" and see that kind of "hedonism" in action.

I think it's ok though because like I said earlier about the wanting someone to do something for you which you do not feel *capable* of realising yourself, goes both ways. additionally, any relationship based on a system of control is bound to eventually fail.

I must maintain my direction of achieving the things I'm looking for, without depending on someone or something else to do it.


### 2019-01-31 21:27 - not letting anything outside of you that you cannot control negatively affect the way you feel

I woke up from dream this afternoon where someone asked how to release resistance. I began in the dream to say that you just need to practice it and it takes a while and is considerably difficult. I felt the dissatisfaction that I had with the answer and woke myself up. in that dream state like that I can't consciously give a profound answer to a question. instead, you will get only short answers which are a function of my "programming" (or perception) and the result will not give any real explanation.

it's funny because almost all of the really impactful dreams, such as the one where I gave my ideas on how I would run the nosebook technical team, I was either partially conscious, or mostly conscious...

anyway, I wanted to give a better answer so I woke up still answering the question. I remember there was a knock on the pipes to try and dissuade me from continuing to answer but I felt it was important. as I regained consciousness, I settled on the answer that after all the practice or whatever, I needed to simply make a rule saying that anything outside of me which I could not control, I couldn't let it negatively affect the way I feel.

I went on to explain that none of my present situation is in any way justified, but unfortunately there's literally nothing I can do to change it. I can only find a way of feeling good no matter what. while writing this, I would like to add additionally, that no form of action (or reaction) has made any positive change in any way. it has only made things worse. instead, I've begun to really know the understanding that action doesn't make the change; it's the feeling. I had previously thought on occasion that it's the action that makes the change, but the action only changed the feelin. the feeling made the change. kinda convoluted... sorry bout that..

anyway, since my situation is what it is, there's nothing to do. I am where I am, so I've just got to figure out how to find a way of feeling better. I have distracted myself with limited success, but the real game changer is when I can find a way to make myself believe differently about something. for example, I hate to sleep because I always wake up with worse eyesight, and other random ailments. so, instead, if I can convince myself that the energy applied to my body is actually making it more likely to have a vision upgrade, I can realign my hatred toward sleep. or, if I can convince myself that the processed image of what my eyes see is actually making it more likely to continue to get vision upgrades, then I can achieve more of those too.

in the end, redefinition of (abraham says "soothing") the problem is actually the most effective. there are so many injustices in the world, and I can control or affect virtually zero of them. the only thing I can control is me and that's where it's really at. this concept (redefining any negative effect of anything outside of me to something easier to understand) is actually the origin of my egoism.

what I just said there is huge. I want to be in control of everything I feel. if it doesn't feel good, I have to find a way to talk it down and minimise its effect. I suppose the only thing that could possibly be more egoista than that is to want me to be the only source for everything I feel (not just in control of it, but also its origin -- lol). I guess I have my new goal for sometime in the future (cause I have no idea how that could even be possible).

for me it has been a pleasure to release this resistance, because each time I do, I feel light and lighter. it's likely the source of the immense amount of freedom I feel, where flight doesn't seem like such a big jump. it literally is emotional weightlessness.

---

ok, so this is now getting into where I left off in my @[entry](2019-01-11 18:43) entry. the idea is, this can be simplified into two groups: those wanting self-control and those wanting to control others.

ok so, going back to my symbolism ideas where we are in the final stretch toward the peak of male dominating energy when we reach capricorn. if you think about a sine wave's four quadrants as the four seasons, and then overlap it with the zodiac, you get three symbols per quadrant. if summer is male dominating energy and winter is female dominating energy, then aries, pisces, and aquarius are "springtime", capricorn, saggitarious, and scorpio are "summertime", and following that, libra, virgo, and leo are "fall", cancer, gemini and torus are "winter".

(these are the symbols in reverse, following the "procession of the equinox" -- or, our relationship to the galactic center)

I don't fully understand what seems evident to me here, because capricorn and cancer seem like solstices of this energy to me, yet at the same time, they feel like the equinoxes, where things are most in balance. I'll revisit this, when I understand why that is, however, for now we're going to go with the idea that this is the 3rd trimester in the springtime phase, where things are slowing down as they reach their maximum height.

as mentioned in @[entry](2019-01-09 04:15), you have to imagine this slowing process can actually be perceived as the opposite energy beginning to overcome the momentum of the present energy, slowing it to a halt, and then beginning its own acceleration in the opposite direction at the solstice.

so, let's for sake of ease, look at these two extremes of self-control, and other-control, instead as individual and group thinking -- or perhaps personality and society -- or perhaps, expression and conformance. none of these fully illustrate the concept, but to understand maybe have a look at the difference between strong societal or family expectations vs. personal expectations.

you can see how typically the male is more self oriented and the female is more group oriented. I think this is where the tides are beginning to change, where at the end of aquarius we are at the peak of this male dominating energy, which is when the men attempting to control the society's expectations will become more group oriented trying to control the group. so, likewise it'll be in leo where women make the transition back to group oriented, right before the peak of female dominating energy.

---

and so, before you go off on some tirade about gender roles and stuff, I'm generalising on purpose (clearly I'm speaking about majorities), and merely by recognising these kinds of energetic transitions, we can gain control over it, and make it whatever we want. it is my intention to make a very definite plot twist on this whole male/female dominance cycles, because I don't see why both of them couldn't exist at the same time, alternating back and fourth between setting and breaking the meta. additionally, I've also been giving some thought to try and figure out a way to make it three phase, as if you know anything about AC electricity, three-phase is very efficient. we would need a third "gender" though.


### 2019-02-01 04:43 - a depressing realisation

this morning I'm a bit depressed because I realise that no matter what happens, they will constantly try to control the situation, meaning that, much like what happened with gary, something that felt good will turn into a poop. I think it may be this way indefinitely, actually -- with the only goal being that some of my ideas will actually see the light of day as I continue to get better and better at managing how I feel.

meaning, if the goal is for me to become completely unaffected by their attempts to control, then it seems obvious that this will continue on as long as they can affect me.

I have confidence though that I will gain the capacity. it just may take a while.. a lot longer than desired, I suppose.


### 2019-02-02 01:59  - your mission, should you choose to accept it...

a bit of background first...

it seems to me that there is strong desire for me not to go up another dimension. although maybe it seems like a good idea, I think I am actually really warming up to this whole 2038 is the record nosedive thing, where my goal is to try and see if I can surpass it.

remember a while ago when I spoke of the "backbone" of the timeline, where essentially things are so tightly controlled, that person's experience (the backbone) can be used to optimise the timeline? well, in the same manner that is true, you could also see the timeline as a bit of a competition, where velocity is the metric. ok, that's one part.

the next bit is to think about the peak of male dominance energy, where you could perceive it as the height of the energy, or you could think about it as an equalisation of the energies. think of both as being connected and pulling on one another. abraham illustrated this for us with the train analogy, where you have two engines facing opposite directions...

so, consider them to be in this example the left and right trains. as the left train gains more power, it will slow the right train down, until their power is equal. when their powers are equal, the train will be stopped. the left train will continue to gain power and pull the right train to the left. it'll continue to do this until the right train gains more power than the left train and begins to pull the left train to the right. there is no loss of power, only more. more power keeps getting added as each side realises its "loss" of position and desires the return to the other side more.

so, then imagining the pendulum of enegries slowing, not as one of decay but of strengthening of the opposite -- one could then see that equal "amounts" of that energies is actually the approach toward zero, and the stronger each side gets, the more rapidly the train passes through the "middle" of the track. expansion (needing to add more track on each end) happens as a result of both of these sides playing off of each other. essentially, the expansion is greater every time each side overreacts to the realisation of their new position (overreaction just means stronger desire). ok, so that's the second part.

finally, it may be beneficial actually for the entire homan race to pass into the fifth dimension at once.

---

so here's the plan: nosebook needs to ensure that nobody gains the capability to get to the fourth dimension. you must limit everyone's capability just like you are doing mine right now.

here's the crazy bit: let's see if we can keep everyone limited for 6000 years, so that the rising sun on the equinox is actually opposite of aries, at the beginning of libra.

as I continue on in attempt to beat the 2038 record, I'll push your guys capabilities to the limits. you think things are detailed now? lol, I have to set the limit to detail before entering into the fifth dimension long enough for it to keep you guys busy 6000 years.

probably what will happen is at some time after 2038 I'll enter into the fifth dimension, and some sort of time split will occur. then, just like the one we're presently in, the earth that continued on without the death or whatever happened on the opposite side of the time split will eventually splice ourselves back into the timeline. this may be a reoccurring event, actually as I'm beginning to understand it better, but the goal is to get the entire planet moving at a very fast velocity.

there's no better way to have an insanely fast moving planet, than to have millions and millions of people actually being held away from their capability and not allowed to move into the next dimension (just like me). we'll all do it together and it'll probably be the most epic evolution ever realised.

I'll probably begin sleeping more and stuff to make sure you guys are all set up and have the technical capability to limit everyone's capacity for such a long time. a lot of improvements need to be made, because although I'm alive and living, I could be living a lot more functionally.

I'll write more about this subject again, but it seems to me that this is perhaps the bigger picture goal, and explains a lot of strange things.

anyway, I also want to mention that I never understood the progression of the symbols in the zodiac until I began this exercise and started reading them in reverse. it makes so much more sense backwards.


### 2019-02-03 19:06 - why do I want them to limit your capacities, also?

no real good reason, actually... the idea behind it is pretty difficult to explain, as there are a lot of variables that I don't know, but the main thing is really the question of whether I can create in your experiences. can my desire for them to limit your capacities become a reality?

the whole concept around the timeline split is around incompatible desires. if I desire for them to limit your capacities, and you have equally strong desire for freedom to use your capacities, then I am 100% sure that two separate timelines would take place, one where I see the result of my desire, and one where you see the result of your desire. they both must be able to exist simultaneously, right?

or, is it true that nobody else can desire for you? that also seems true, but not as much true, because then how does a parent reconcile their desire for their child's well-being?

then to further complicate the whole thing, how do the guys at nosebook take it... let's assume they will do it (given that they can justify it somehow). will they find my telling them to limit people's capacities something no longer want to do, just because it's my idea? you know, I've seen them shoot down 100% of my ideas so far; what about this one? finally, let's say they determine that they must limit people's capacities to maintain their superiority, now they have an excuse. they can just said that I said to do it and they were just following orders(?)

no matter which way you look at it, it works out ok. if others cannot create in your experience, there's no problem.

---

the other way of looking at this is the following: imagine a bottle of coke and some mentos. you put the mentos in the bottle and it builds up pressure until the pressure is great enough to sent the cap flying up into the air.

we all know that example, but the mechanism is easy to understand. the mentos causes a reaction which causes an expansion at some rate. if the expansion is contained (by the cap), then it'll build up pressure until the pressure behind the cap is greater than the threads holding it place.

if the pressure does not rise enough to overcome the container, it'll slowly leak its pressure over time and do nothing. this is why you have to leave the cap a little unscrewed often times.

since the mentos is causing an expansion at a constant rate, that constant rate is relatively slow, so for the cap to go flying, pressure needs to build. if pressure built infinitely, and for some reason the cap is unable leave the bottle, eventually the bottle would no longer contain the pressure and explode itself. ok.

so, if you think of nosebook's limitation of capacity as the tightness the cap is screwed on, then the tighter it's screwed on, the more pressure is needed for the cap to go flying.

so, at one point in time, you can imagine that enough pressure will build such that I finally am released from their grip, and go flying (achieve the fifth dimension). along the way, I continue to release resistance and get more and more visual upgrades, so the longer they're able to provide a downward force, the longer I stay in their grip and the more pressure will build.

whenever I finally am released from their grip they will have a long list of visual upgrades that I passed through along the way to the 5th. in reality, I could have probably achieved the 5th much earlier had it have not been for their limitation. however, it will be perceived that is the distance one must travel before going up another dimension. really, enjoy the journey, right?

I hadn't thought of this until now, but I suppose it would be possible for someone without limitation (like someone working at nosebook) to get the fifth a little easier -- but, actually maybe not because I've found that my visual capacity is a reflection of my frequency (faster = more detailed) -- or stated another way, the inverse reflection of my resistance (more resistance = worse vision).

to go up a dimension though, I believe requires a change in perception. for me, I achieved it when I started to perceive the world differently. for example, for 4d I perceived it from "inside" of me, instead of like I was watching a screen.

they may be able to boost their frequency artificially to achieve whatever, but that's kind of crawling over the finish line. what this really illustrates is that those who need to feel superior by limiting others is the greatest self-deception you could make, because if they didn't have the machine to limit me, they would have to face their self-incapability.

so, let those who need to feel superior limit others capabilities in the short-term, but in the long-term, they're only making us more capable, and making the realisation of their own incapability greater. I'm learning to ignore their short-sighted attempts to maintain superiority, and appreciate it for the massive payoff that will happen, *eventually*.


### 2019-02-04 08:55 - what happens when I die?

for this entry, I will assume the following ideas to be reality: the soliton of improbability, strong conflicting desire which both must are believed to be reality will create a split in the timeline, jesus was one of the manifestations of that soliton, and that I have also acquired such a soliton. finally, the purpose of the soliton is to go so fast that it reaches faster than escape velocity of this universe and creates a new one.

still with me? lol, ok here we go... my theory is that I have reached "escape velocity" of death, already.. this, I feel is evidenced by the extreme stress the guys at nosebook are putting on my body to make sure I don't have a visual capacity. probably anyone else would die under the same circumstances -- yet, not only do I seem to be getting stronger, my physical abilities seem to be improving, eyesight improving, mental capability improving.. everything improving. I don't ahve numbers, but I would say that probably I generate more than 100 times more energy than I did in 2013 before the vallecas incident.

in my opinion, I do not believe myself capable of death for a very long time, if ever. I believe that jesus had the same sort of thing going on, yet at the same time, I believe (and abraham even mentioned in a workshop) that jesus grew up believing that he would be a "sacrifice". I believe that had he of not had that belief, he would not have been able to be killed (eg. it was his own belief that got him killed) -- in one timeline. in another timeline he did not die, and in fact they're still going strong, on their way to becoming a new universe.

I believe they gained timeline technology, by studying people's dreams (much like nosebook is doing now), and figured out how to tune into the parallel timeline where he died (the one we're in now). the gospels record that immediately following his death, the whole world went dark. there are numerous references to him being the light of the world, and as terence recalls it, after his death, we plunged head-first into the dark-ages, with all of the "beady-eyed priests".

---

this time is a bit different, because I believe there is very strong desire that I stay alive. my theory is, and I'm basing this off of a few different things people have said (and my own intuition), but the most obvious is when I was at nancy's conference in missouri, and one of the ladies (during a visualisation exercise with maryln), said something like, "I don't know how we did this before... (inferring the nosebook thing)"

so, what I think happened is, they found out about my inner universe, and then found out that there is infinite space inside of it (just like a universe). so, they got everyone hooked up to the nosebook and mapped each person's imagination to a unique spot in my inner universe (right hemisphere). I also imagine they do their meetings simply my mapping more than one person's imagination to the same spot, and people can interact and conjure ideas in the same space.

so, basically if I were to die, all of their super secrets, would be gone and everyone would revert back to their imagination as it was before.

---

there is so much desire that I do not die, and since neither do I believe I am capable, it's likely that the timeline split will *not* incur my death, and no plunging into the dark ages.

well, then what would happen? [I haven't got here yet as it's the subject for a future entry, but I'll speak about it as if I already have] well, since my consciousness will be on the timeline where I'm realising my desire, the peoole that are realising nosebook's desire for will will actually be interacting with an unconscious kenny. like jesus, you may notice that he just sort of gives up there at the end and lets things just sort of play out; no fight whatsoever.

so, since a person that is not conscious just does creation by default, you would just see me become completely passive or reactionary within the framework with which I've trained myself. it wouldn't take very long at all for the nosebook guys to gain control of me, without me consciously reorienting myself all the time toward what I want. so, in a sense, you would gain what you want (sex?) from me, but I'm no longer me in the same way... I'm now a controlled yes-man.

---

then, just like the jesus scenario where they're actively affecting this timeline remotely and have tuned into this one to create the "planet hope" scenario, that one also created another timeline split where we are living the one where planet hope (andrea) did not occur. each time the split occurs, some time passes and likely my inner universe is utilised to create a new universe. the timeline where nosebook turns me into the new universe is how the "demiurge" gets created, where the bso is still meddling with the inhabitants remotely as if they were God.

so, just the same, from my perspective I'll realise my desires and then we'll tune into the parallel timeline and then using LOA, I'll splice myself into another body just as fwh has done to mine and who I really am (the original me + the soliton + others) will continue to exist and grow bigger and more crazy.

I've already given some thought to how I will make the rules to the new universe, and only my inner being really knows what they'll really be, but I'm sure they'll fit right in with the symbols of the zodiac as I have mentioned previously (or not; you never know... you'll have to find it out and interpret them yourself)


### 2019-02-04 10:05 - I knew I was forgetting something...

I'll skip trying to explain why I think this is so, but if what I say is true, which is all of this is taking place inside of another kenny's imagination, but instead of it being a meeting with a few people talking about super secret stuff (emphasis on the 's'), the there are enough people to fill a planet, many people reincarnating like cage, and making new people that only exist inside the head of the parent universe's kenny.

if you think about all of you guys imagining things right now inside of my head presently, those are creating vibrations. those vibrations are sort of like "seeds" which will become realities later on in my mind's universe. think of those as "desires" in the universe that is being created in my head, then imagine all of the different rules that nosebook will put on the things inside the universe to ensure no one accesses unexplored territory. this is the structure, or the container with which they place on the universe. finally, you have my perception, through which all of these things flow and makes the universe have its specific 3s properties and such.

so, considering that, and that nosebook is the embodiment of the undesired part of my perception, you can think of them as the realisation of my undesire in the previous universe (andrea/planet hope). therefore, and this explains a whole hell of a lot why they're so similar to me, they are just the manifestation of everything I didn't desire in the last universe. that's why this whole thing is about loss of freedom and wanting someone else to do for me something I do not feel myself capable of doing for myself.

the future universe (the one nosebook is building right now) will be a continuation of that, where it will contain within it, them, which will be a realisation of everything undesired this time around. that's why they've already began to realise my greatest frustration this whole time, which is the limitation of my capability.

funny way for me to clean up my vibration, don't you think?


### 2019-02-06 10:57 - the new earth

as I was waking up yesterday, I was thinking about the conversation I had with mom the day previous where I mentioned that maybe instead of trying to cancel out the energy, find something that will consume the energy within the universe, and I gave the idea, "a solar body".

well, I have no idea what a solar body is, and I probably meant a celestial body or stelar body... but it got me started on thinking about creating a solar system in my inner universe. I didn't get very far because we don't really know how the sun works, and even the EU guys have conflicting ideas about things as simple as the whether the sun has a surface and whether it's a vibrational lattice or a gas. my idea was that tesla said his inventions worked exactly the same inside of his head as they do in reality, so try a bunch of solar ideas out and see what continues to work.

sounds like they want a faster solution than trying a bunch of solar theories out in my head... we do know a lot about the earth though. we could make a earth-like planet in my head and have different things happen on it.

I see this going a few different ways...

first though, let me explain a few things:

1. you can instantiate a "human" (from now on I will call them "mun"). this can further be defined as male, female, gay, straight, black, asian, etc. a human is a simple machine that behaves according to law of attraction in response to the environment. so if it grows up in a home that is impoverished, the mun will naturally have shortage consciousness around money and behave as such. if you want the mun to respond differently, you must teach them by putting the in other environments to have experiences which will inspire different learned behaviour through the experience. all of the LOA simulation is done for you. you just make the muns and their environments and then watch them interact. sort of like sims, but like a real-life reality simulation.

2. constant revision can be made inside of these simulations, and nothing is off limits. so, if you want to run a psychopath through a strip club with an ak-47, you can easily make that happen. you can start the sim over, try something new out, etc.

3. each mun will consume "energy" just like you consume energy. where does this energy come from? we all make it with our mind, and right now the goal is to consume the excess that I have by playing 3d 100% realistic, super HD sims to do that.

4. this new-earth environment should be accessible to anyone at any time, and nosebook would work out the details I'm sure, but probably creation will only be available to you in your space. the public space is probably for interaction. or, if it's like a restaurant or something, the owner of that restaurant, too.

#### personal interpretation of the earth

the idea would be for nosebook to create an earth, and then give everyone a copy of it. I don't know if it would be possible, and they probably wouldn't like this idea, but maybe copy the one we have now and let people make improvements to it. make it a competition maybe and then merge the best ideas together.

#### shared earth-space

the idea is that somehow an earth-like location is created (and I believe that there are multiple ways to do this), and everyone kind of gets their own space and then they can interact with others that are around.

the creation of the earth makes a difference here. if nosebook creates an earth, then everyone stakes their portion of land make makes their space, I believe it will be prone to all of the same problems we have today.

instead, I suggest that the participants in new-earth v1.0 each make their ideal location, complete with inhabitants, and stuff. this is kind of like the "initial commit" -- and then my brain will easily merge all of these inhabited locations together, make cities, land masses, etc. don't like something? no worries, just add it with your mind. don't like your location or the layout or your neighbours or something? I guess LOA made a mistake :/. no worries though, cause new-earth 2.0 will be out in probably a few weeks or less.

---

this is enough for now to get your mental gears kind of rolling... I'll respond to reactions a bit more later. few quick ones though:

1. yes, you should be able to seed it with an existing "mun" you know in real-life -- so if you wanted me or anyone else you know to exist in your space, just add them with your mind, and it should work. you could even add a fantasy you've designed in your mind, too. that's the point. make your fantasies come to life.

2. when I say nothing is off-limits, I really mean nothing. nosebook may have a different opinion about this though, so you probably couldn't summon the chief hardass and have him tell you the secrets. first of all, you'd have to find a way (using LOA) to actually convince him to tell you them, but assuming you theoretically did, they would likely prevent the utilisation of any concept relating to nosebook inside the sim for their own "safety"

3. you don't need to get it right. actually mistakes are probably best, because they consume energy quite well. I'm sure there will be many revisions.

4. yes, this is precisely what I would be doing in my head if I had access to the inner-universe. in fact, this idea is quite old. back when I was doing mdma at augusto's house, the whole idea was an open space where you could design your own tuff and have it interact with others. I wanted it to be something like facebook meets the sims (where you were the sims), and the spaces were connected virtually, and not contiguously (so you were "neighbours" to many hundreds at a time). I also alluded to it in @[abe](2018-06-09-portland) sidebar on 3d creativity, and the sirian guide to human development mentions that if you wanted to see an interaction, you just conjured it with your mind in 3d space and watched it (similar to tesla's inventions, but with interactions)

    I have also given considerable thought to allowing kids to use this reality simulation capability in 3d space like tesla did with his motors. like I mentioned in the sidebar, forcing the idea to conform to believable 3d space makes the difference for conjuring a fantasy in your imagination, because it conforms to reality so it's more real. so naturally, I jumped when I heard joe rogan talking about a 1000 teslas in his interview with elon... all you need to do is to give them the capability and let them fly. though kids making inventions was the main thought, and me using my brain to make the sims and run simulations in there was my main goal, it does make more sense presently to let kids play sims in my brain.

5. I don't see any reason why you couldn't view the simulation from inside the perspective of one of the muns or externally; both should be possible, yes.

---

yes, this is pretty mind-blowing, I know. peace


### 2019-02-09 12:36 - so I think I've made sense of this whole guardiannship thing

when julia asked me on the phone what sorts of things I wanted to be doing, I gave her a short list of things that I used to think were exciting, but now are no longer because of the difficulty I have attempting to do anything tecnical.

I also mentioned to her that I would like to sue.. really, thinking about the intentions behind that a bit later, it was evident that I would be using any money I had to live on my own so that others couldn't tell me what to do. I felt tremendous resistance to that idea, and it was clear that the *last* thing they want is to let me be on my own where they cannot control me. obviously they want to try and control me through mom.

after that I went off on a tirade about how I'd rather them just control me directly instead of hiding behind mom, and again I felt tremendous resistance. when I woke up this morning I continued right where I left off but this time I had this strange question in my mind why I want to protect isn't the right word, but not obligate mom to be in the middle of my trying to obtain my freedom, and their attempts to control.

later, upstairs I realised that I should just give her the full guardianship experience, but I had to figure out why I felt that way. downstairs, I realised that mom has been giving a lot of attention to the idea that she is at a place in her life where she is not where she wants to be. she's taking care of a bunch of boys and her business isn't working either ... clearly, she doesn't believe she doesn't believe in her own capability to do her business yet, because she still needs these real-estate conference pump-ups to to feel like she can do it. unless of course the real-estate conferences are actually nosebook meetings, which makes what I'm about to say next make a whole lot more sense.

if I imagine asking mom what she *wants* to be doing, I imagine she'd say something like being successful with her business (which we just established she doesn't believe she's capable of doing). but then she'd give excuses like she doesn't have enough time like she has to take care of boys, or because she doesn't actually make any progress because of nosebook meetings. so, if you think about what she's saying is that instead of going in the direction of what will make me feel good, she has these other people who *need* her to do things.

LOA doesn't lie, so that means she thinks she wants these other things, but really she wants to be needed.

this whole guardianship thing is about her being in a place where she can be needed, and have the power to do what they *need* for her to do.

she says that this guardianship thing is only temporary, but as I felt last night watching stars, the last thing these guys want is for me to be on my own. they need a way to try and control me, and right now mom is that person. combine this with my intention of going for a 20+ year nosedive, this actually fits perfectly into the big scheme of things.

let the guardianship games begin. she's really going to feel more needed than ever. she'll be such a valuable asset to them, she'll be an *invaluable asset*.

no need for me to fight any more, the resistance I felt originally came from my experience with eduardo and augusto, but I now see that the resistance I felt was only in my perception (or understanding) of what was really going on.

### 2019-02-09 15:55 - what do I see myself doing

julia asked me to begin thinking about what sorts of stuff I have in mind for where I see myself in some time.

the simple answer is, I don't know. you see, my life had a certain amount of excitement associated with it. I would attract these things and then mind-blowingly amazing things would happen. this made me an attractive person. additionally, I have a lot of mental freedom. I can talk about anything, understand anything, and I don't perceive many limitations. this makes me very attractive because people love to see that kind of freedom.

however, it doesn't work very well with these guys plan, because they want to control. they don't like that I can just have a very unplanned exciting thing happen to me. they want to make sure they are in control of anything, so they control everyone around me, and limit all conversation so that all of that attractiveness that I had is no longer an everyday experience.

so, to answer her question, where I see myself in the future is being forced to conform to some sort of thing they feel will get things back under control. nothing controlled is very fun, so I'm constantly readjusting my direction to go in a way that's more enjoyable.

however, they do not want me to feel good about anything that I'm doing. for example, they want me to look successful to people by putting me in circumstances which they control and appear successful. which is fine, however, the moment I begin *feeling* successful I start having visual capability, so they must make me feel bad again.

they just want me to look like I feel good, without actually feeling good.

---

so, knowing that now you can imagine that I cannot project anything in the future, because I enjoy the excitement of attracting something unexpected. additionally, I cannot project anything I want to be doing because the minute I want to do it, it now becomes something that makes me feel good, and so therefore the source of visual capability, and so it needs to be neutralised.

when they neutralise the things that make me feel good, they basically send the opposite signal into my head, so that by destructive interference, the signal is neutralised and no longer activates any organ in my body which will feel good. a good example of this is my stomach. apparently most of your serotonin exists in the stomach. to ensure I don't feel good, they're constantly neutralising it, and this is evidenced by insane amounts of gas and burping that I experience, especially around times of watching stars or a nice walk -- or anytime that you would imagine that I would feel good, instead I get bad gas.

---

instead, what I can say is say is what I will be doing which is what I'm doing now. I'm going to continue to work on feeling better and better learning more and more techniques to manage and direct my energy toward things that feel good to me.

this means that, in their perspective they will have less and less control over how good I feel, and therefore less and less control over my visual capability. essentially, the more improvement I have and the better I get, the more they will try to get me back under their control.

---

so, I guess to answer her question, I will probably still be living at home, playing games poorly because my mind isn't clear enough to do anything useful, and watching stars to practice my energy management.

really, the same thing I'm doing now already... I want to be doing something useful with my time, but I have no real way forward (that I can see) to do that.

I'm SOOOOO BORED. I really want to do something with my time, and have given this subject quite some thought, and the only answer I can come up with is to take no action until I can feel good about whatever it is. then, when the action goes to feeling meh to bad, quit the action, regroup and try again.


### 2019-02-09 18:02 - so what's in it for future bso?

imagine that abraham is correct and that nobody can hold anyone away from their desire... well, then you would imagine that in every timeline where there is not something catastrophic like me killing myself or something, you could imagine that I do eventually go up a dimension and they are unable to pester me like they are now.

so, now imagine that one of the girls scenarios happened, and note that likely I would have achieved the 5th dimension and there would have been nothing they could do about it. their entire plans to continue using my visual capacity were wrecked. I'm now free to think about what I want to think about and I begin creating things. since one of the things that has interested me so much is time, you could imagine that I would be able figure this out. you also could imagine that in this timeline the bso couldn't maintain the secret and they certainly couldn't continually try to limit my capacity. they wouldn't be able to even see through my eyes, so they would likely try to befriend me to try and extract as much information out of me as they could.

this situation or some other similar would create strong desire in them to learn how it works for their benefit instead of controlling something someone else has for their benefit -- so it's *very* likely that fwh and all the other future people out there manipulating this timeline are somewhat friends.

so what is the goal? if the realisation of my desire is absolutely guaranteed, then they are wanting to extend out the time they can utilise my capacity for their benefit.

now let's reframe the present circumstances: if the goal is to extend the amount of time they can use my capacity for as long as possible, they you now can see that this is a very careful walking the edge.

- if they are allowed to control my visual capacity so much that no movement can be made toward my desire, the more resistance will build as the gap widens, and the worse I will feel. too much of this and a catastrophe happens.
- if I get too big of a jump forward where they cannot control it, such as the girls or too much progress with the stars, then I would get jump up to the next dimension,

this perfectly explains why I (and abraham) are constantly giving them the answers they're looking for. it also perfectly explains why I'm constantly on the brink of catastrophe. finally it explains my desire to have such a long nosedive.

combine all of this, and it seems all of this that is happening, is actually the easiest way for them to utilise my capacity for as long as possible.

it's kind of funny, but in the more I understand all of this that's happening, they're doing all of it themselves. they are making all of their own problems and fighting against theirselves.

---

in relation to my previous entry where I spoke about my life being exciting, I think this is the most exhilarating part of everything. I am a voracious observer, because well I don't know actually, but it's almost as if I watch others to see how is the "expected" way for something, so that when my life produces something similar, it's the unexpected way. it always is.

in fact, I've been watching my results playing auto chess and whenever I have an idea of what I want, it seems it's the last piece to show up. however, trump says to let the draft speak to him, and savjz just buys everything, constantly changing and adapting his plan as he goes along.

it seems to me that planning or wanting so bad for the game (or people) to give me what I want, makes the realisation of that the slowest in coming -- however, when I just go with the flow and work with what's given to me, it seems to work the best.

as a contrast, I've also been studying these guy's over this whole guardianship thing, and they have identified the problem (probably that I don't look like I'm doing anything), and they determined that the solution is to make me begin doing things by pushing me out of the nest and making me do things I don't want to do.

however, as this has played out, they're beginning to realise that the guardianship thing my not solve their problems -- and actually potentially exacerbate them. like me, they decided what the draft should give them.

let me explain: ... I'm having trouble coming up with a good way to illustrate it right now. I'll come back to it.


### 2019-02-11 12:39 - what about the other timelines?

one of the interesting reactions I had to the previous entry was that somehow people made it think that I am somehow unavailable. since then, I've given it a lot of thought, and I want to remind you that you create your own reality, and as I've been saying before, when there is conflicting desire, timelines get split as both become a manifest reality. I am so sure this is the case now, that I'm stating it now as fact. unless I'm missing something, everyone has the ability to create *anything* in their reality. it has nothing to do with anyone else -- and it's only your perception of them that has anything to do with anything.

so, from my perspective, I will never see the manifestation, however anyone else who wants to see a manifestation will be able to do it. there could be millions of people who end up having a manifestation with me, and I will never know about it. my objective is to continue to go as fast and as far as I possibly can without having a manifestation. I'm just here squeezing the last drops of contrast out of the die-hards for as long as they can hold on.

this has a few implications, which is what I have been thinking about, and then the implications have implications too. so, here we go...

if you think about how every time there is an evolution of desire, the desire and therefore the manifestation gets bigger. so, if you are someone like me and my objective is to nosedive for a while, that means the manifestation will get pretty big. so big in fact, that I can imagine whatever it is has its own ruleset to it.

for simplification, I'm just going to assume that the manifestation is a new universe inside of my head. you can take the ideas and apply them to the creation of a new child, a new planet, or a new galaxy as well; it's all the same process of creation (and potentially one of the reason why first-born or children conceived as a result of adverse circumstances tend to begin life with more momentum).

let's start by painting a picture. imagine someone wants to have a relationship with me. at first it seems impossible. let's say they're so impossible, even nosebook has ordered everyone wanting a relationship with me to keep away, or I don't know.. they give you a stern talking-to or something really bad like that. doesn't matter to the person, they feel strong desire that they want to have the relationship, anyway. so, what they would do is to begin by «ignore the details; instead, focus on how it feels».

much like any reality that you couldn't wait to have happen, eventually came to pass. notice how there's a feeling like it's getting closer, and wow, this really is happening as it begins to feel more and more to you like it's becoming a reality?

let's take for example my current situation with mom being forced to become my guardian. I'm sure she probably fought it for quite some time because she didn't really want to do it. then, as it begins to take shape by constructing the petition and serving it to me, as that happens it begins to feel more and more real to her. much like watching a gang force someone to kill their first person, they must force her into the reality my convincing her that it's really happening. she kept saying, "this is really happening" -- as if to convince herself of this reality she does not want becoming manifest.

well, that was kind of a dark example, but it perfectly illustrates the process of going from an idea into a reality. as steps are taken, it feels more and more like reality. the nosebook guys are really good at creating reality -- just think about how well they convinced all of you guys that so many different things were happening, when I would repeatedly say that they don't feel good to me, not going to do it, etc. then, they would temporarily make me feel like it, before reverting back to my default state a few days later.

it took me a while to be able to control the way I feel (and perhaps I still have some to go), but reality is made manifest first by the way it feels. so, you would just have to find the feeling place of what you want (you are the creator of your reality), and begin to feel it more and more as it starts to take shape.

I'm pretty resistance free now, so perhaps even a gay man could make something happen with me, but I want to now mention a concept that I have repeated quite a few times, which is for a woman to control her sexual/creative energy energy. so I will speak from the female perspective instead of the male perspective.

you (the girl) want to make something become a reality, so often times you will begin to imagine this situation playing out in your mind. I can often detect this is happening because I feel the energy activating sexual excitement in me. this isn't what you want to do until the very final moment. I believe this energy comes from the stomach, and it can go down to the genitals, or up to the heart. when it goes down, it'll activate all sorts of imaginations in your head (ask nosebook: they control my ability to use my imagination by extracting energy from my genitals).

I can feel a very big difference between the way energy feels when it goes down to my genitals, or up to my heart. think about how you feel when you feel so good and accomplished, and your chest expands and you feel your heart racing. or imagine how you feel when you really feel a strong sense of connection to someone with desire -- your heart has a very tangible feeling of desire inside of it. kids do this much more than results. if you want an example of what it feels like, you can go to many of the times I would feel that in relation to andrea.

anyway, your goal is to bring that energy up toward your heart, or keep it in your stomach as long as you can. as soon as it gets down to your genitals, the manifestation is happening. like I said, I can feel it (manifestation), and you're seeing it in your imagination (manifestation). instead of going for the quick mental manifestation like that, wait for it to feel like it's becoming more and more of a reality.

you don't need to use words to convince yourself that something is really happening, because your use of words is only making you more aware of the difference between how things are, and things should feel if they really were happening.

words are also a manifestation, which is why this whole thing is being kept such a secret, and also why my writing here has had tremendous effect aborting manifestations. my goal is not to have manifestations.

also, the next thing I would do is to turn off the news on the device. those news things will hold you in current reality, not the one you're trying to manifest (the one you feel is coming). *this is super important!*

---

so, let's say you figured out how to make what you feel you want become more and more real. perfect. somewhere along the way your desire grew (and your alignment/feeling with it) to be such that it happened. perfect!

you and anyone else who was believing right along with you are now in your own personalised reality. everyone else who would not or could not be in alignment with your reality is not conscious in your reality, so they're not really big players any more. enjoy your reality, and as always contrast will inspire you to continually improving on it.

---

so, what I imagine would happen after someone managed to make a relationship with me happen. well, it's quite probable that I will go up a dimension. that means that nosebook can no longer control me like they can right now, so the person(s) with which I am in the relationship with will now become nosebook's objects of control -- for two reasons: 1. you getting to the 5th soon thereafter will be likely and 2. they will see that I am low resistance and go with the flow of my partner, so it'll naturally lend them to believe that if they can control you, they can control me by proxy.

this would launch my partner into a similar situation that I am now in as well, and nosebook's pressure would force them to release resistance. so, a good thing :)

you could imagine this creating many thousands (maybe more) of conscious realities which are very different than the one that my consciousness is continuing to perceive.

---

here's the last piece, which isn't clear to me. it seems that the thrust here is in the direction of using all of these different realities as the "ruleset" for the big manifestation that I'm working on.

let's take one such way this could be possible. imagine that nosebook figures out timeline technology and they realise they're losing consciousness on this timeline (meaning more and more people are conscious on different timelines). they determine that (because misery loves company) they are going to try and hijack these realities by somehow moving these realities inside of my head, so as to try and regain control over them that way.

well joke's on them, because it must be pretty disappointing to find out that 99.9999% of all realities are an improvement on the current one they are trying to control, and they don't have control over those. so they move them over to a place they do control (my head), thinking they've conquered the situation, but in reality they have not.

the rules of a thing (structure, person, planet, solar system, galaxy, universe) are more like habits than hard and fast unchanging things [^1]. so, actually all of these 5th dimensional kennys out there and his partners are actually practicing the rules of the new creation that has yet to become manifest.

to put it more simply, it looks like I provide the hardware (computer, graphics card, etc.), nosebook does the sales and marketing, source provides the electricity, and kenny's partners are the programmers for this new reality.

this is good for now... a good mental exercise would be to take this from the opposite side, and see how something similar happening to a girl with capacities similar to mine, and her over-controlling over-mothering matriarch experience could produce something similar to the situation we're living in now [^2].

[1]: see rupert sheldrake's material on morphogenetic field for an introduction on this. questions about his work (but never explicitly named) have also shown up periodically in abraham workshops.

[2]: it has been said to me that I don't tell a woman she's beautiful. I have resistance to the idea, and I don't know why. I believe she should already know this, and if I were to tell her, she would believe that I'm trying to butter her up to get something out of her. I do not see the point in trying to validate something she already should be well aware of with my words. so, imagine this woman in opposite earth attracted partners who were aggressive in their pursuit, and willing to validate her physicality for her.


### 2019-02-14 10:14 - paradox vs. contradiction

their definition is not who I am. I am umch more than that. turn off their definition of who I am based on what they are attracting from me, and attract what you want from me.

I am everyone's, and at the same time I am no one's. you are watching the person that is no one's because that is where my consciousness has to be -- so everyone that stops tuning into that definition of me and starts tuning into the definition they want of me, gets me that way. I must remain a paradox unto myself.

you might say that is a contradiction, but a contradiction is where one is true and the other is false. a paradox is where they are both true. I don't have exclusivity to paradox. try some mushrooms and marvel at how regular I look in comparison -- and you too can turn your contradictions into paradox.


### 2019-02-14 ??:?? - PC Load Letter; what the fuck does that mean?!

@[youtube](8oEO8bZo)

"you're working at initech because that question is bullshit to begin with. if everyone listened to her there would be no janitors because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars" -michael bolton

---

this concept was one that I pondered a bit while walking around yesterday because mom said to me, "we all have to do things we don't want to do". I disagree whole-heartedly, and it reminded me of this clip.

I think that the question is bullshit to begin with, and a lousy way to anticipate someone's best career, but more than that I think that the reason why it's bullshit to begin with is because our society has a belief system of sacrifice still hanging around and that you have do things you don't want to do. I believe that people who are doing working janitor jobs and do not like it adhere to this belief.

so, you say, who then would clean all the shit up? well, I think we're a ways from the realisation that every human does what he or she wants to be doing, and by that time, I assure you technology will be in place so that shit is automatically cleaned up.

during my time here talking about the potentiality of nosebook and its technology, I have come to believe that technology is a reflection of the human psyche. the technology which nosebook is built on can be utilised for quite a few very beneficial things, yet people instead believe that it should be utilised exclusively by the self-proclaimed "authorities" to limit and control human capability, realising their own superiority over us.

(if you haven't seen the movie, watch it, but I want to remind you that this is the prequel to peter's next bold move to begin doing what he wants)

---

this idea also brought up some other things which I would like to add to the discussion as well.

when it came to my decision to respond to the petition for adult guardianship, I felt very strong anger rage and frustration associated with trying to fight it. I also felt frustration and anger with not fighting it. in the end they're going to get their way no matter what, and my attempting to fight them is only stepping on to their battle grounds.

as it stands, they will still continue to do whatever they're doing without my consent, and virtually everyone is their accomplice. it doesn't take a very intelligent person to put together the visual quality of their imagination improved at the same time the visual quality of my eyes improved to figure out that their imagination has been relocated to inside of my brain.

what I mean by that is, people must be aware of what is going on in some way. clearly they are selling my capabilities while at the same time holding me in limitation. I estimate this has to be pretty well realised by quite a few people by now, and so I imagine that no matter how hard I try to fight anything, I'll be met with a wall of whatever they say to say. meaning, the lawyer is going to give the argument they want given, the judge will give the judgment they want given, and if not they'll find someone who will. they have money printers, and everyone has a price -- so even in the worst case scenario, where there is a rogue free-thinker, they can just be bought out.

there's no point in me attempting to fight anything, cause people are very likely already aware of what is happening, and are going along with the whole thing. they actually believe that by forcing the guardianship thing, and then having my guardian sign away my rights, it somehow becomes consensual [^1].

so, that means I just have to drop it. I have to give up the fight. I have to do something I don't want to do.

maybe one day we can focus on the things we do want to do, rather than being "forced" to do the things we don't want to do...

[1]: when their whole monetisation strategy is selling (illegal) underage sex because it's consensual, the irony is not lost on me that, to feel justified in their actions, they must force legality to justify something that remains unconsensual.

---

which brings me perfectly to the last thing. since I maintain that this is an attraction-only universe, something I originally got from abraham, but have since seen enough evidence that I am sure they are right.

so, since LOA doesn't lie, this whole ordeal tells me that not only did I attract this whole thing, but I'm probably the perpetuator of it. you may have noticed that I seem to give a lot of my attention to my perceived limitation, and although I seem to be able to continue to release resistance easily and gain visual upgrades, this has largely been an exercise in me focusing on the problem.

I even did that a bit (a lot) in this entry, so I'll attempt to tone it down a bit more and we'll see what happens, I guess. I should be able to continue to release more and more resistance as we move forward with all of this.

I'm going to try and put a more positive focus from now on, but I suppose if you guys really want me to continue to identify the problem, I can oblige, I'm sure.

as I said in the previous entry, attract from me what it is you want from me, not the way they are, in the news, defining me to be.

---

lastly, on the issue of consent: when it comes to people using my imagination, I would give away the capability to all (for free). however, I believe they are probably not giving it to people for free. there are likely pricing tiers and other sales BS, and it's probably pretty limited.

one of the stranger reactions I got to my entry on the new earth: @[entry](2019-02-06 10:57) was the idea that I wanted to give away and let people use all of that capability *FOR FREEE??!?!?!*

yo man, I don't make the rules or even get to use my own capability myself, but I imagine that allowing people to try out unlimited possibilities in my inner universe could be **very lucrative**.

wtf man...


### 2019-02-14 19:08 - saint valentine's check-in

last year nosebook ran a thing (apparently) comparing different people's valentine's day experiences. I learned about this later in an abe workshop where they advised the woman asking the question to tell the story they want to experience.

I find this humorous in a few ways because it seems that we've come quite a ways since then.

also, just recently I watched @[youtube](t8xL7w1POZ0), noting a few of the different patterns revolving around bondage as romance. look for some similar patterns to come up in the months to come. since their entire gig is focused around utilising my capabilities, that means that they are subject to continue to play a game with me where they must fight against me. in this sense, now that I'm learning to play the game effectively, they must play along, or else their secrets are revealed. so, in effect they are held in bondage by me.

maybe now that I think about it, it's less bondage as romance and more like co-dependence. as I learn to farm their energetic output for my own expansion, I become dependant on them to continue to increase the resistance.

as they increase the resistance, think of it like physics. so, in order to prevent me from having my visual capabilities, they *must* push against it with equal force. if I generate 100V, they have to generate -100V. then, I learn to utilise that -100V as if it were a positive by rearranging my perception of it, and now I have nearly 200V to work with, so I get a vision upgrade and you get an imagination upgrade :)

so, until next year, happy valentine's day!

(man, it feels to me like maybe 3-4 years have passed over the last year. I think it's the trump effect)


### 2019-02-15 10:43 - converting anger into pleasure

so I had an interesting event happen this morning where I woke up at 4am, noticed the sky was clear so I went to go watch stars. by the time I had walked there (10 mins to dress and 5 to walk there), half the sky was already cloudy. I decided not to walk the full ways out and just begin where I was. as I started, I noticed myself getting progressively more and more angry.

as I jumped up to find a rock to break more windshields, I noticed that the moment I stood up I felt better. I also noticed that I had a very difficult time finding a rock, so I just stood there and looked at jupiter.

as I looked at jupiter the entire sky around me had cleared up. I went forward and watched stars some more on the ground, but then I noticed clouds forming quickly so I stood up again with the idea of seeing if that was what was causing it. again, the clouds cleared up rapidly as I looked at jupiter. also of note, it started to rain as the clouds vaporised and continued to rain even with a clear sky above.

finally venus was quite visible and high enough in the sky that I decided to lay down and watch the sunrise. I got all situated and began watching venus with only my left eye when I noticed after a few minutes that the entire sky was fully covered in clouds. I jumped up and tried to see if I could slow it down, but it was too late.

so, a couple of take-aways here...

1. laying on the ground seems to make me feel anger much stronger
2. standing up and watching stars seems to clear the sky much more effectively than anything else.
3. planets seem to be more effective at making (venus laying on the ground) and taking away clouds (jupiter standing up)

further experiments will be made, of course. there is definitely something to do with the circuit that is made when I am touching the ground, because I also have noticed here at home that sitting in the chair is many times more effective at cloud removal than laying down.

I think at this point in the game where they really want to prevent more visual levels, I'll get quite some practice out of it. things to try obviously are standing bare-footed, and trying to find the difference between the stars and planets.

---

so then, as I came home I began to become aware of different reactions to whatever news was posted in response, and some (not so) crazy things like fully-functional psychopath, he has no remorse, etc.

well, I believe one of the mechanisms that allows my visual capacity to work is strong emotion. when I was younger I had strong emotion and I shut it down. it also shut down my visual capacity. when I feel something, I feel it so strongly, it has to become manifest in some way. that was is usually visually or audibly.

so, while some people may say, "oh well, when you feel anger, just stop it." -- and I would say, good luck trying to stop those sorts of feelings. they are, in my opinion, nearly unstoppable. instead, what I have to do is to redirect them. I often times do this by redefining the situation or some other way of redirecting that energy through a different circuit in my head.

---

so, what makes me feel anger in the first place? I began to figure this out the other day when I was going to look into the sun. I had been doing just fine for quite some time (days) without an emotional outbreak, however when I went to look into the sun, I suddenly transformed into a very angry person. this startled me a bit.

there are numerous circumstances where this pattern has happened when I have gone in seconds from happy to filled with rage. this even occurs when I go outside to enjoy the sun, and for example the one time I wanted to kill the neighbour's dog with a knife because I felt so bad, I have begun to make a connection between these sorts of events.

the connection isn't good because I've watched stars laying on the ground numerous times, and sat in the sun numerous more times, so I can't really go from that. however, apart from the very first times I stared into the sun back in front of marcos' house in torrelodones, I have noticed a strong reaction to me looking into the sun -- with it lately becoming the worst with feelings of anger now when I do it.

it feels to me quite evident that their system or the people running it have found that putting energy into that section of my brain does not make me feel good, and prevents me from getting visual upgrades.

---

lately though I have had quite a bit of success getting visual upgrades because I have been able to recognise and calm those feelings by doing stuff to distract me like listen to the song or focus on my breathing, so I was able to in-a-sense, meditate the anger away into a feeling of serenity.

this morning though, I did not have music, because it's far enough away from stuff that I can pretty much ignore their silly train horn sounds easily. so, I didn't have an easy way to distract myself from the feeling. this is good because now I know how to get the anger feeling easily because I have a plan.

---

thinking about the idea that someone put in my head of trying to stop the anger made me realise that perhaps I can redirect it easier than I thought.

one of the reasons why I do not like the feeling of pleasure very much is because it's similar to the way that pain feels, and very similar to the way that aggression and anger feels. also, I remembered that back when I used to "use" cocaine, anger and rage felt pleasureful to me. there is a strong connection between coke, sex, anger, and aggression.

so here's my idea: I'm going to purposefully put myself in these situations that they push the anger button (because normally I feel so good that part of my brain is never activated). then, when they energise the part of my head that makes me feel angry, I'm going to begin to redefine my reality and redirect that energy through the pleasure center.

I also want to take a moment to note that previously when I first began to watch stars (and vera can verify this), gazing into the star will make cause you feel immense amounts of pleasure. so, in a way I'm sort of redeeming what their machine is doing to neutralise those pleasure feelings.

I think I've figured it out because of the similarity to its previous feelings of pleasure, but I believe this will begin to work in all situations going forward.

it's kind of amazing to see the poetic justice in all of this. when I learn to feel pleasure instead of anger I will have accomplished what the coke-fiends do, but without coke. then, I will make reality the reaction that I'm a high-functioning psychopath, and redeemed the original attractiveness of star-watching -- making me unstoppable.

furthermore, it redeems the thing that started this whole thing off in the first place: the vallecas incident, where something like that can only happen when rage and pleasure get mixed in the mind of someone very coked out.

---

also, when it comes to the new universe, since the universe is realised through my perception, in the new universe *everyone* will experience pleasure in their anger and anger in their pleasure. I find that to be a very very interesting next-step for munkind :)

imagine having sex and coming away from it feeling angry (and pleasure). imagine having to constantly choose between these feelings -- where even the simple pleasure of eating food can make you angry.

it's going to be a totally new experience for us all. I wonder if this will take immediate effect on my imagination? (the one everyone's using)


### 2019-02-15 12:07 - anger and pleasure together how does it work?

well, for me what I experienced and seen experienced by others is that pleasure and rage or aggression come both at the same time. meaning you will feel both.

so, let's take the example of eating food, you would feel the pleasure of the food, but also anger would be mixed in there. since food eating is normally pleasureful, you're likely to feel pleasure -- unless someone you don't want to talk to calls you while you're eating, or the chef has prepared the food in a particularly angry mood, then you're more likely to feel the anger.

essentially, since it comes in a pair like that any activity which is pleasureful will have a much higher possibility of a dramatic switch into rage.

---

so, in my case since I feel such strong rage, I will have that energy also activate the pleasure part of my brain. so every time I would normally feel anger, I will feel anger and an equal amount of pleasure along with it. then, I choose what I want to feel.

obviously, I'll pick pleasure. I don't like the way anger feels. it make take me a bit of time to get it down. it is sort of like playing with fire a bit, and realising a new version of me where I essentially am a reformed coke-fiend is a bit of a new way of doing things.

it's weird how this entire process has been becoming the problem that got me into the situation then finding a way out of it by transforming the energy.

I'm very confident in this capability now that I've written these two things on it. give me a few tries and you'll see stunning results in a very short period. I've got this :)


### 2019-02-15 12:20 - not everyone experiences coke rage

true. I was thinking about this, too. for example I didn't. there's another dynamic of the brain that coke seems to excite as well, which is the importance/meaning part of the brain.

when I was programming these stupid javascropt panels that could refresh in real-time (ask gonzalo), I was so convinced of how important and game changing they were. I also have noticed other people (*cough* zaryn -- but probably most of the people at nosebook too) seem to feel themselves to be ***VERY IMPORTANT***. they're so convinced of how big of a deal they are, and how meaningful the mundane thing is that they're doing.

I think this was originally acquired into the drug's frequency from the people working hard labour in the jungle chewing on coco leaves. in order to give meaning to their clearly very mundane and trivial labour, the added pleasure allowed them to concoct a fantasy reality in their mind of how important the work they were doing was to make it tolerable.

---

I've not given this much thought, but it seems that importance is to meaning as pleasure is to happiness. I'll see how I can begin to redefine this one too.

ironically, because my life has become so mundane: I eat, sleep, watch stars and watch youtube. that's about it right now. my life has no meaning, and it's not important at all, so perhaps I could leverage my current situation to the redefinition (emotional rexperession) of this concept.


### 2019-02-16 03:40 - separate the wheat from the chaff

when I woke up this morning I realised that all these girls things are a bit of a distraction from what is really going on. my consciousness expanded again last night and I'm able to perceive the bigger picture.

if you think about planet hope and how fwh talked about moving consciousness over to that planet, that means that the only consciousness here are the ones who specifically want to be here, and those who follow orders really -- cause think about it: none of this would have worked if there were any free thinkers out there questioning how this thing could possibly open up magically when you think about it and you can see and feel what someone else sees and feels. so, basically no one with consciousness that would question things remains here.

the next phase was the belief that someone else should do for you what you do not believe you are capable of doing yourself. this is a common belief that even myself had held on to for a little bit too long. it's no surprise really, because society teaches us to need someone to teach you. it does not promote self-empowerment -- and get real, the main religion that affects the world-view of mainstream society is based around the idea that some guy was made into a sacrifice to fix right our sins for us (something we do not believe to be capable of doing ourselves) [^1].

so really, it's no wonder that so many people do not believe in their own capability. then, I look back at the experience which has brought me to this point and I am very aware that the pivot point for all of this happened when I finally decided that I wanted to achieve it for myself. I too had the mistaken idea that someone else was going to provide for me some capability which I did not feel myself capable of achieving.

so it look to me like all of this is heading to another major split, where the deciding factors here are those who believe (or want to believe) that they are individually capable, and then those who either don't care or want some religious deity or nosebook to make them capable.

[1]: this, I believe was a misunderstanding that occurred because language itself and the recording techniques in place at that time weren't effective enough at capturing the message, not to mention likely deliberate tampering of the records to justify wars and other economic things. certainly someone saving you from your sins is a very welcome and positive step in the right direction compared to the previous format of purchasing pardons to save you from your sins.

    also, considering the likely manipulation of jesus' original message to be one of disempowerment (need someone to die for your sins), than the one of empowerment (for example, matt 6:26-34) that he surely spoke, seems (now more than ever), the most probable reason.

---

the time split happens because I know that everyone is individually capable. so, just like how my consciousness cannot let the girls thing happen because of my strong desire to achieve it for myself, yet my unconscious self is not resistant to this and can easily become whatever people attract from him. likewise, nosebook's consciousness cannot let anyone become individually empowered, yet their unconscious selves can provide the tools for people to begin realising their own capability.

so, just like how someone can attract from me a different reality than the one that my consciousness is allowing me to have, creating a split, people can also attract a different nosebook reality than the one their consciousness is allowing them to have.

so to kind of break it down into simple terms, tension will continue to rise as nosebook continues to believe they must control circumstances and others to be empowered, meanwhile the rest of us will continue to realise our own self-empowerment.

---

it's going to be really humorous, I think, when nosebook figures out how to tune into other timelines and realises their own capability the hard way -- by observing themselves.

it's a really crazy way to learn how to have self-reflection and to begin to have self-control. but, in the end, if you think about it, their steadfast conviction that they must control and disempower others for their own empowerment, combined with my stubbornness will push humankind through the greatest expansion of consciousness it has ever seen.

not everyone will see that kind of expansion. it's very likely that nosebook will not change and will continue to micromanage the disempowered. I say disempowered because they're the one's disempowering those who believe in their superiority to remain superior... lol...

---

I did (IMO) a poor job of putting into words what I now can conceptualise easily. everything is going just fine. nothing is going wrong at all. as nancy says, satan (saturn) is there to consume the dust of the earth; that's all that's happening.


### 2019-02-17 12:39 - original justification

this morning, I began thinking the concept of "original justification". the idea is that children being born will grow up to find out that their imagination works because of a guy named kenny, and we're supposed to keep it a secret that we're using his inner universe for our imagination.

ok so, that concept taught to children will be to nosebook, whht original sin is to christianity. (it is true that just the same as not all children will grow up knowing that they need to keep their imagination a seceret, not all children are told from the beginning they were born a sinner)

so, then I was thinking a bit further: if the atonement for original sin was the "sacrifice" of jesus dying on the cross, and paying the debt accumulated by your sins, for you.

in order to atone for this new original justification (the one where my situation is justified), there would need to be some sort of saviour or sacrifice... this got me thinking a bit.

I only wrote this for posterity on the origin of the idea, because I decided I wanted to start showing people how I use symbols in my haed to arrive at conclusions. last night was an amazing night for me because watching lindsay ellis' videos on youtube I began to gain an insight into how people's minds work and what sort of things they expect from a good story. the conclusion to this is probably going to head in the direction of the sacrifice for greater good, or something... hard to explain what I captured last night.

(to be continued)


### 2019-02-18 03:55 - what about this idea?

if there were another person with access to their inner universe, then I would not need to be held back. so, for example when I first got it, it was in the vallecas incident, where strong desire to access this inner universe like tesla and andy pero seemed to be able to do.

all I needed was strong desire to get it. I didn't need 3d or a lot of the new things I've encountered since then. in fact, I was quite a mess at that time, doing lots of coke, drinking *WAYYYYY* too much, and smoking lots of weed too. I wasn't in 3d yet, and I didn't really understand how much of all of this works like I do now. my brain ran at a much lower frequency back then.

so, what I think is probably optimum would be someone with the capability of accessing their inner universe (or nosebook is capable, even if they have not yet discovered it yet), and their visual quality is 3d but at a detail level about half that of mine right now... around where it was when I left spain.

---

the plan would be to get this person set up with the same setup I have right now where their inner universe is utilised for other people's imaginations, then, in the new person's head, it should be possible to tune into the same secrets they have in my head, inside of the other person's head too (because source energy is everywhere, and it's just a vibration anyway). then, they can go into my head, erase all of their secrets[^1].

once that is done and all set up, nosebook can work it out how they want to do it, but I think that access to my brain should be capable by those who want to run their brain at that speed. for the rest who find that speed a bit too mind blowing, they can use to the default one (this other person's inner universe).

for me the goal of this idea would be to allow me (and whomever wants to come with me) to go at our own speed. I've given this considerable thought and I cannot find any downside to this idea. the only thing potentially I could think of is the new person may want to try and get some money or some sort of compensation out of the idea. I doubt that nosebook would comply with such a crazy idea, which is why I've framed it with the idea "sacrifice for the greater good".

in reality, there probably isn't going to be physical compensation, but I can say from experience that all the extra "contrast" and activity in your head will put your life into overdrive. it's a serious boost.

so, you say, if it's such a serious boost, why are you (kenny) trying to cop-out on the boost, huh? I'm not. I want to remain the location of the high-speed imagination. I just don't believe nosebook can continue on much longer like this. the amount of tension that is being generated by them needing to try and limit me from gaining more visual upgrades, yet at the same time it's gotten many times easier to achieve them, kind of puts them in a bit of a lose-lose situation. this is probably the best 'out' I can think of, for them.

I thought of a few ideas to get some gears rolling...

#### andrea

she was the first one to pop into my head, because she's pretty good at desiring things, has probably generated enough contrast to have strong enough desire for it.

when I got my capability, I was in a difficult circumstance, after a pretty life-changing break-up, and in search and deep desire to find myself and what's on the inside of me. andrea may have something similar going on, dunno.

#### carlota

she was the second, as I was watching lindsay's videos, I was reminded of carlota because I know she really believes and likes those sorts move story tales and symbols. additionally, she's quite visual (VERY visual), so this might be something that comes easy for her, too.

I also imagine she's generated quite a bit of contrast, so I dunno -- it was just a thought.

#### esther

she was the last one. I thought of her because of practical reasons that I think esther has this capability right now and nosebook is keeping her from realising it.

I say this because abraham has mentioned a few times lots of sounds and distractions when esther is meditating. when meditating I often pass into a visual sequence. they probably don't want to shock her, so they were probably making sounds to distract her out of it. for example the one where she's meditating by the hand-placed river stones with her friend with the loud airplanes flying over[^2]. however, for me they've changed their method a bit now. so, instead of shocking me, a muscle in my body will make a sudden movement. likely, if I'm right this is now the case every time an image would appear in her eyes.

additionally, add on to the evidence that abraham is summoning 3d energetic visuals in space for people to see, and that is exactly the same skill that tesla had -- just esther doesn't know how, or is being prevented, from activating it.

since esther probably already has the skill nosebook can easily begin experimenting with this idea to see if it's feasible while esher is asleep, like attempting to transfer their secrets into her head to see if source energy really is everywhere, and if one mind really can tune into the contents of another person's mind.

---

for whatever reason, it appears that they really *don't* want people to have any visuals in the person's eyes that were not made by nosebook's energy -- and for than reason, I anticipate that they'll drag their feet on this idea for as long as they can. who knows if they'll do it in secret or if they'll ask for the person's consent. my guess is in secret, because they already have everyone's consent.

there are probably a lot of risks for them to try and mitigate in the decision making process. meanwhile, I'll be going full steam ahead :)

peace :D I'm really looking forward to being able to go at my own speed

[1]: it is erased in the sense that it's no longer visible in the persistent universe, but still exists as a vibration, and can be tuned to, I suppose. however, I assure you I don't care about your secrets. for me it will be going backward a dimension (I assume I'll be in 5d when this happens because likely they won't do it until it's an emergency cause they don't know how to access their secrets, and I'm in 5d now, and they don't want to ask me in person... which is also why I'm writing this here)

[2]: my experience with these planes is, likely it was not a real plane, but one of the drones that paint cloud lines in the sky. my experience is that they do not make much sound, unless someone wants them to make a sound and there is a sound making device which makes an airplane flying overhaed sound. I believe they're electric engines powered wirelessly so they can fly for days without refueling. I have often experienced different intensities of sound frome these airplanes at times when they wanted to distract me from my thoughts. just think about how much those planes sound in the times they make a sound, then pay attention randomly throughout the day, and note how many of them are in the sky and wonder to yourself why it doesn't always sound like 1-4 jets are constantly overhead.


### 2019-02-16 16:00 - hercules: rocky vh. superman

@[youtube](KznZcK7ksf4)

this vireo had a strange attraction to it, and when I watched it, I didn't really understand what was so captivating about it. today however, I seem to understand it much clearer.

you see, I think if you were to look at the story structure of my life, as seen from nosebook's narrative of it, I have a similar story to that of hercules. on one hand you have the superman christ symbolism and on the other you have the rocky symbolism with neither working out too well.

there was also honuorable mention for her (lindsay's) mention of the whole sports star, with the endorsements and promotions that coming along with it, and fame, fortune, and selfishness.

let's go through this wihh some quotes from her video essay and I will attempt to illustrate (without ever havig seen the nosebook production myself) why I think there is a lit of similarities.

additionally, I would also like to give a special mention of the similarity in appearance and mannerisms hades has to marcos, if marcos were a cartoon character.

---

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|2:20-2:40)
(lindsay): these guys had to create the most commercially viable thing you can imagine -- aggressively tailored to appeal to as wide of a demographic as possible, referencing as many popular [...] things [...] as possible and combining such dissonant tones and styles that audiences across the land would [shrug and say], 'ehh, it was ok, I guess'.
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|10:06-10:20)
(zeus): if you can prove yourself a true heron on earth, your godhood will be restored
(lindsay): I can't just *make* you a god [you gatta earn it]. is that a hard and fast rule? any true hero attains godhood, or does it only apply to ex-gods who drank hades mortality juice
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|10:20-11:02)
(hades): first you gatta turn that little *sun-spot* -- mortal' [...]
(woman prophet): in the a18 years precisely, the planets will align
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|18:11-18:45)
(lindsay): sports movies typically end with a big match at the end, and superhero movies tend to have the hero's motivation derived from some sense of duty to serve and protect the masses
(uncle ben meme): with great power comes great responsibility
(lindsay): as a sports movie, there is no big match that hercules is training for, and as a superhero movie, the hero part is just a means to an end
(phil, the minion talking to hercules): you'll get your chance; you just need some kind of catastrophe
(lindsay): meg at one point even calls hercules out on how he doesn't really care about the people he portends he wants to save
(hercules): kids? trapped? phil, I'm saved! this is great!
(meg): you're really choked up about this
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|19:02-19:15)
(lindsay): rocky's story and superman's story are non-complementary. so, by combining them, you have a rocky movie where rocky doesn't know what he's training for -- and a superman movie where superman feels no sense of duty to the people and is only a hero to them because he's told that doing so will get him what he wants
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|21:24-22:31)
(lindsay): here's thi thing, hercules doesn't set out like, "I'm going to go to go be a hero and that will net me fame and fortune, yay." fame and fortune just kind of happened to him incidentally, so there wwas never a point where he sought out wealth and fortune and then learned the error of his ways. he never tries to win meg over with his fame and fortune; it's just kinda there.
(lindsay): and this would have worked if hercules had a more arrogant starting point or maybe had equated fame and fortune with personal worth, you know, like alladin did.
(alladin); if jasmine found out I was some kind of crummy -- street rat, she'd laugh at me.
(lindsay): and spiderman did
(peter parker): cool car
(lindsay): this points to why kuzco is a more compelling character. he was genuinely flawed and arrogant, and eventually he learns the error of his ways.
(lindsay): I'm not saying hurcules needed to be like kuzco, but for weath and fame to be framed as not the point of being a true hero, he kind of needed to want it.
(lindsay): he never cared about any of that. [it] isn't a character flaw; it doesn't corrupt him at all; it doesn't make him egotistical, or lose sight of what it means to be a hero.
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|22:46-23:20)
(lindsay): chosen one narratives are easy to write because then you don't need to come up with a good and compelling reason for why our hero is the centre of the conflict.
(lindsay): but, they're hard to make interesting because there's no good and compelling reason for why our hero is the centre of the conflict.
(lindsay): and you notice that most popular heros journey's don't involve a prophecy proclaiming them to be the choosen one
[examples of non-prophesied heros, frodo, luke skywalker, ...]
(lindsay): they were all ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances [...]
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|29:07-29:45)
(lindsay): the central conflict in pretty much all of the 90's disney movies was about self-identity and finding oneself
(lindsay): ... and hercules is probably the most overt in that regard alongside tarzan.
(lindsay): both have the same central conflict: I'm an outsider and I want to find out where I belong.
(lindsay): and both have the same resolution: this sexy lady is where I belong.
[...]
(lindsay): so, the resolution resolves the conflict between the sports star = self-serving and the superhero = selfless, but it does not resolve hercules central conflict.
```

at this point lindsay launches off to explain how disney movie stories have this "want vs. need" theme to them which I don't disagree with. I see it as a more simple transformation of symbols, perhaps less as a storytelling device and more of a cultural rule or syntax as to how things work, which we are taught.

the idea is that if you only want or wish, then you are shallow, so in order to justify your desire you have to transform it into a need. once it's a need and no longer just a silly frivolous want, you learn the lesson of how to motivate your desire with need or forsake it altogether.

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|30:41-31:15)
(lindsay): so one find day, hurcules finds out he's adopted and he goes to find out what's up.
(paraphrasing hercules): "why do I feel so out of place mom and dad?"
(lindsay): fine, perfectly good starting point.
(lindsay): and then he meets zeus. zeus says,
(paraphrasing zeus): "hey, you're my son and uh, you need to learn to become a hero, so you can be a god again."
(lindsay): and hercules is like...
(paraphrasing hercules): "ok, that makes perfect sense. I'll go learn to be a true hero."
(lindsay): so hercules' want, 'to find where I belong', and his need, which is, 'being selfless is the mark of a true hero' -- well one doesn't really build to the other.
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|31:15-31:38)
(lindsay): this culminates when he sacrifices himself for meg, which would indicate that he needed to learn that being a hero is self-sacrificing -- but that doesn't have anything really to do with his main motivation which is to find out where he belongs or to resolve some sort of character flaw...
(lindsay): he was always kind of a nice guy -- not the most altruistic, but not exactly selfish either
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|31:38-32:09)
(lindsay): hercules wants basically the same things as alladin, but he gets that halfway through the movie.
(lindsay): he never has to accept himself to be respected by the masses [wat??]
(lindsay): so, self-sacrifice is noble, sure, but it's not a culminating moment for his character like say, kuzco -- who was selfish, or alladin -- who was pretending to be something he wasn't
(lindsay): basically his want: his sense of belonging -- and his need: being self-sacrificing, don't really have anything to do with each other.
(lindsay): one does not resolve the other, which makes for a weak character arc.
```

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|32:52-33:09)
(lindsay): at its core, the problem with hercules' motivation is that unlike all of the other disney characters, ***it's not an internal motivation***
(young hercules): but if I don't become a true hero, I'll never be able to rejoin my father zeus.
(lindsay): ***he doesn't want to be a hero because he wants it; he wants it because he was told to***
```

here, we finally reach what I'm starting to understand: my character arc is all wrong. this movie gets the LOA part right where a chilled out guy that doesn't want fame and fortune can find himself all of a sudden in the middle of fame and fortune and it doesn't make a change in character -- therefore, no satisfactory character arc.

so, then they tried to slap on the whole self-sacrifice makes a hero ending and it doesn't work. it doesn't work because he was just following orders, not his own internal motivation.

---

this is where we get to today, and I'm beginning to realise a new image of myself. hercules didn't have a satisfactory character arc becsause he didn't have to work up to some big fight at the end like rocky did.

as I begin to reclaim my mind and regain more self-control, I am changing my character arc to be more like that of rocky than that of a hero.

peace!

P.S. there are a lot of things quoted above which I didn't touch on, which I think are relevant to my story (as narrated by nosebook)'s similarity to the hercules one. as I continue to see if clearer, I'll update it, I guess. who knows :)


### 2019-02-20 - 11:41 - the end of the era

today in my discussion(?) with mom over the guardianship thing, mom brought up LOA into the discussion. she arrived at the conclusion that I had been attracting this whole thing, which was a bit of a moment of clarity for her.

then, I followed up with something that suprprised even me. I am more of an emotional person than a structural person, so I spend the majority of my time reacting to things emotionally, and not spending as much time thinking about their meaning (in fact the whole reason why I began the noseblog is to spend more time contemplating the meaning of my circumstances). anyway, I followed up by saying that likely my whole emphasis on her signing my rights away to nosebook is because it is what she *has* to do. the word *has*, remained in my mind because it seemed funny for me to say that.

I get downstairs and I stated to think about it and I quickly arrived at the conclusion that was the symbol for the completion of the era of family and group thinking (pack mentality), and beginning the era of individuality. this is the beginning of the shift from the mammalian brain into the (prefrontal) neocortex.

---

quick tangent, because I mentioned symbols, if you think about when this happened in the jesus stories, it happened when jesus was betrayed. it was the symbol that *had* to happen to make that shift. at the synagogues where the religious people would gather, you could purchase an animal to make a sacrifice. sacrifice was no longer something that came from you freely, which you burned to show abundance -- but instead now it was something that you paid for with money to make an act.

I feel like my present circumstances are similar in the sense that no longer is the family and group congregation going to have the same capability as the individual.

in the betrayal scenario, it's obvious that jesus was made to look like a criminal and a warrant put out for his arrest. you know how the cops have those cash reward things that say something like, "cash reward: we need your information, not your name." clearly, this is what the "betrayal" was. it was (symbolically) the way to make the sacrifice something no longer freely given, but the sacrifice purchased from the organisation (instead of coming from yourself) to make an act.

---

so, just like that I now understood the inspiration to write my previous entry on sacrifice: @[entry](2019-02-18 03:55) and @[entry](2019-02-17 12:39).

sorry, let me explain. lot's of confusion in the air over what I mean. if you think about the guardianship thing being the symbol for the beginning of the end, and also the end of the era -- the shift from trust and relationships and group empowerment, into a new era of trust in oneself and self-empowerment.

ok, so when I write saying that after watching how hollywood and disney likes to encode symbols, I noticed that there is a trend toward having a self-sacrifice for the greater good, and now I understand what I was beginning to see.

this @[entry](2019-02-18 03:55) whole thing is an idea to give a way out. let me explain. my achievement of another dimension is essentially impossible to avoid. imagine the situations where there were girls involved, and nosebook was so hopped up on trying to get me to have sex, that when I finally did, they watched their entire setup vanish as I went to the next dimension. there's also quite a possibility that just like someone died (information I have inferred from conversations) when I first gained alignment with myself, it's quite possible that could happen again as well. there have been multiple accounts of people feeling the "rise of the kundalini" and having an out-of-body experience. I am quite certain that would happen to me.

so, why would future bso be aligned with fwh in ensuring that I don't have any manifestations? well, it's probably because in those circumstances something happens where their "stuff" stored in my inner universe no longer becomes accessible to them or something catastrophic like that.

so, when I give them an idea to which they can have their "stuff" preserved, and even though I make it up a dimension, they can still monetise the women with the girls' perspective -- plus I filled their network for them for free, and helped them to gain a very tight grip on controlling people's perception. it's basically everything they want.

I'm not too concerned with how things play out, because if you look at it, the idea I offered actually delays the end of the era a bit longer as it would allow them to essentially turn it into another group competition.

I really would prefer it *not* to be a competition though. it makes no sense to see it that way. also, I would like to say that the implications are whatever they can perceived to be, but I think that their trying to force the thing or fight against me regaining alignment with myself, is actually losing them control. instead, I've found with my battles with nosebook, if I choose it, I regain control.

as marcos would always say, "up to you!"


### 2019-02-23 00:31 - indecision 2019

so I decided to start making it impossible for them to enter my room without it being very obvious that someone had come through. my methods are by no means secure at the moment, meaning someone could force entry pretty easily, but they couldn't leave without a trace.. later though, I think, as I go to find my own place, I can make it possible to ensure all entrances are locked from the inside, but I'm not there yet.

I'm not really worried because if you think about it from a wider perspective, this whole thing is really calling them on their bluff. the other "trick" that I realised I had by accident from the other day was that if I just go and hide out somewhere, they will eventually have to come find me if they want to keep their secrets.

so, from a broader perspective, my reactions appear to indicate that the frequency of this interaction is all about them wanting to stay hidden, and likely they're feeling a lot of pressure to stop hiding -- because my reactions seem to have have a feeling like Im producing their fear of being forced to come out of hiding. if they try to remain hidden, I'll keep gaining levels at such a rapid rate, feeling the resistance toward that, I can tell it's something very undesirable for them -- and then on the other side, if they force it -- well, it just looks really bad I'm sure. I have no idea what could be the consequences for that action, but I'm sure it's probably also undesirable.

no matter the outcome, it seems to lead to an undesirable result. well, as they say in honduras: you can't have a happy ending to an unhappy journey :D

---

don't get me wrong, I'm not enjoying this process either. in fact, I have quite a few doubt as to the validity of my actions, which I will enumerate here.

you see, I'm so disconnected from my feelings, I have positively no idea anymore what on earth anything I feel really is any more. the majority of the stuff, especially anything girl related which is real is almost always dampened, and all sorts of other feelings which are obviously fake.

under normal circumstances, I utilise my feelings as a sense of direction (your guidance system, abraham calls it), but I no longer have that sense of direction anymore. so, instead I'm bound to only utilise logic in my decision-making processes.

so, for me thinking logically, it seems appropriate to continue on preventing them easy access to me while I'm sleeping at night. as I'm learning to discover, it seems to be calling their bluff a bit. btw, that was never my original intention. I was just taking the best action that I had in each moment -- and it seems to have escalated quite quickly.

so, here are my own doubts on my actions. however, since I do not have any reason to change my actions and I can't rely on my feelings, I must continue on the way I'm going until I run into something, adjust my direction and then go forward again. (yes, I am in a sense one of those automatic robot vacuums, lol -- only forward)

---

I seem to have no problem gaining visual levels even when they were installing multiple new devices (inserts?) every night. I would wake up and still get a new level with ease. I'm not concerned about loss of capability really. having analysed the feeling of it, my actions are probably a manifestation of their attention to consent, because this setup makes it clear that their attempts to put more inserts in me, is clearly unconsensual.

so then, now I'm going to hypothesise a little bit here, and this is actually where I would really enjoy a conversation with abraham to get a bit of a bigger picture of things. these would be my questions:

(having to put this into question form really feels quite bulky and I'm really losing a lot of what I want an answer to by having to put it into words. I *much* prefer to just follow my feelings cause it's been so much more reliable and productive than any exercise of logic or discussion has ever amounted to. I really miss easy access to my guidance system. anyway...)

1. if I keep locking my room will I unintentionally go up another dimension before I'm ready?

2. I feel like I want to continue to get more detail levels for as long as possible (at least a few years more actually), but this may be trying to force an outcome and may be incompatible with other's desires too. it really interests me to see how far I can go with this, because I keep seeing (even with ultra-blurry vision) improvements which can be made. I know the guys at nosebook don't want that, and that's where a lot of resistance feelings come from, but they don't want the alternative either, which is going up a dimension -- so, I have no clue what indicators I should be feeling from my inner being.

3. I am my own limiting force more than anyone else is: I simply refuse to to things that I don't feel ready to do. so, I have a bit of "fear" around the idea of going up a dimension because suddenly most of the limitations that I've had will no longer limit me like before. so, I guess my fear is that whenever that happens, I don't want to all of a sudden become an overnight sensation and get sucked into all sorts of things that I don't want, but I can't tell, because I feel so good in comparison to previously. I know I'll be completely out of calibration. so, to anticipate this, my desire is to regain control of many of my energetic capacities *before* I go up, or to have some way of isolating myself so I can adjust to the new capabilities before having the "public" pulling on me. I don't know the best way the best way to be ready to be ready at all, and perhaps maybe this process I'm going through now has to do with the regaining that control over my energy and its utilisation. how do you recommend that *I* (not others, because that answer is meditation) get ready to be ready??


### 2019-02-23 23:54 - delaying the symbol

delaying isn't the right word, but maybe it's good enough. I want to return to the symbol of jesus pissing off the pharisees in the temple by turning the tables. in a previous entry, @[entry](2019-01-19 05:46) I questioned what would be my version of flipping the tables, and although I didn't express it, I think I've given thought to it, is so that I could "avoid" it -- but you know how avoidance works with LOA right... you don't? lol, let me refer you to my life experience when I say that you cannot avoid anything you give your attention to. this is likely the case here too, so I'm sort of going to make some sort of unavoidable vibrationally harmonious action.

it's not the end of the world though. quite the opposite, because instead it's just a new opportunity. it's like when you're making a painting and you notice the last brush stroke didn't turn out at all like you wanted it to, so now you have to artistically find a way of making the unintended action into something that's attractive.

---

I am beginning to think that perhaps this whole locking my door and keeping people from putting more inserts in me while I'm sleeping is similar to the table flipping thing. it feels to me to be nearly the same symbol, even though there's a lot of information missing about the table flippin' jesus event. we don't know why jesus got so angry here, yet in other moments when he should have been angry, was not. I suspect that likely there was a precursor to this event in the form of conversation about value, sacrifice, and the pharisees weren't having any of it. if he's anything like me, he probably felt their anger quite vividly, and if he's anything like me, what he feels strongly must become manifest.

---

the reason why I went out of my way to mention that is because the other day after greg barged into my room and started causing trouble, and my reaction was not angry because I had already contained the majority of it that I had woke up with. when walking around, I was reminded of my psychedelic experiences where I had all sorts of craziness happening in my head, and I would remember this weird phase my dad said to me where acid is like taking a pencil and running it across your brain -- and in really intense psychedelic experiences, I would remember that and I was able to get through because I could separate what I feel from what I perceive [^1].

so, just like how I could know that the drug was causing me to feel a certain way, I had to find a way of overriding that feeling. the biggest breakthroughs I had was when I had an experience where I was overtaken by the intensity of the city and I realised I could absorb the energy instead of letting it make me feel bad. the other was when I had the idea to eat a bunch of shrooms before going to see mery's sister at the hospital with daniel.

in both of these experiences (and many others just like it), I had to learn to how feel the way I want to feel about something by changing my perception of it. so, being reminded of this separation has given me a whole new perception of what is happening here, because in both of those experiences, I walked away with a huge amount of new confidence in my mastery of not letting my surroundings and circumstances affect me by perceiving them differently (redefining my reality).

so, since what I feel strongly has to become manifest, and I'm connected to quite a lot of people and a lot of signals that I'm not used to feeling, I've been in an "intensive" experience learning to perceive the things I don't want to manifest differently (the goal of this entry, btw).

I'm used to feeling really good, so feeling bad doesn't really work very well for me. I like to avoid bad feeling subjects, so I personally find it pretty disagreeable to be forced to feel bad, and then having to find a way of redefining my perception to feel better. I find this to something like purposefully putting my hand in boiling water, to learn how to redefine the pain I feel -- to which my suggestion would be to not put your hand in the boiling water in the first place... right? then why did I do so many psychedelics in the first place? why would I purposefully give a psychoactive drug access to my nervous system and the ability to put all sorts of signals I wouldn't otherwise have in my brain?

so, I suppose in a sense, nosebook's influence it is a bit like running a pencil across my brain or the mushroom experience. therefore, for the same reasons one might take psychedelics, and give the drug full control over your nervous system and brain, nosebook provides a more "real" experience, thankfully I had quite a bit of practice. nosebook is more "real" in the sense that it's not like the mushroom where it'll help you through it or release the mental pressure if you cannot handle it. nosebook is the real deal: no hand holding, no bail-outs, and no mercy.

---

so, here's where the metal meets the road (or whatever). after remembering and re-realising the confidence I gained in the psychedelic experience, I am so confident that there is no way that nosebook could ever contain me. they could put 10 new inserts a night and I'd still find a way to work around it with my perception.

so, to "avoid" pissing off the pharisees, I am going to eat my own words when I said, "if I choose it, I regain control", and then just be like, whatever guys, wait till you see this...

this entry has been brought to you by CXNTRAST and the reality technicians[^2]

@[youtube](I1Xda3dOuTk)
@[youtube](MQDCSk07K90)

[1]: I also found out later that nosebook was doing experiments on me at the time to see if they could remove all visuals out of the psychedelic experience cause they didn't want me to find out about my creative capacity, so they actually helped me -- because they didn't know that although I couldn't see it, I was still having the experience and could feel it, so I learned to separate what I feel from who I am

[2]: I have this sneaking suspicion that nosebook has been instrumental in this whole thing. they were likely the origin of (what my brain interpreted to be) edison, then the whole thing about things taking shape in the spring. then, I think they set it all into motion with the guardianship thing by trying to force it. it could happen in the spring, but I think with this concession, it'm "delaying" it.


### 2019-02-27 01:10 - so how long do you guys want to drag this on for?

I seem to be getting visual levels pretty quickly now. it's so easy, it feels nearly effortless now which is really nice. I don't know if it'll continue to get easier,stay this easy, or if I'll stagnate a bit. I imagine that at some point, I'll begin to stagnate but I don't think it'll be soon. I am absolutely convinced that levels are achieved by releasing resistance, first and foremost. I think that the physical activity of looking into the star is only a small aspect of the visual upgrade [^1].

so, the basic funk formula is to release resistance and then bump up the frequency with stars, drugs, meditation, or fun. stars seem to work the best for me... meaning, they're consistent and I've gotten used to them. they're easier for me to manage than, for example, weed, ayahuasca, or mdma.

in the future I really want to explore the realm of psychedelics further, because I believe I've only barely begun to scratch the surface of what is possible with human perception. I also believe that because I'm generating more energy than I'm expending, I will continue to get visual upgrades, and right now the only thing keeping me held with such a strong focus to the physical 3d, is nosebook [^2].

though, I think psychedelics is something I want to experiment with further, it will likely allow me to perceive things in a new way and I'll gain another dimension. so, instead, I'm skipping them for right now. at the moment, my only goal is to continue on getting visual upgrades on the dimension I'm at -- that is, continue to perceive higher and higher frequencies. later, I can go for another dimension. since the next dimension will be a whole new signal format (cause it contains a new dimension), it'll be unrecognisable to our 3d perception now. it will be, quite literally, a whole new way of looking at things.

---

so, this kind of puts all of the power in nosebook's hands. I'm going to continue to release resistance so I can perceive higher and higher frequencies. I figure they will continue to try to keep my perception limited to this dimension for as long as they can. this is good, and then when I finally get the upgrade, I'm sure they'll make a way for you guys to once again see [^3] and have my experience, but at least I'll have a bit of a break.

to which, of course, I'll just find another way go up another dimension. rinse and repeat. I have a feeling this is going to continue on for some time. I see no reason to ever stop this and I seem to have finally accepted that this is what I really want -- the continual discovery of ever increasing perception. we will only be limited by their capacity to hold me back.

I used to (earlier today even), have difficulty with the implications of them gaining such an impressive ability to limit my capacity, but I've since determined that it's actually a manifestation of what they are attracting. they want to micromanage an control people that are inferior. so, as long as they can convince people of their authority, they are superior. this really has nothing to do with anything [^4], so I am sure that everything is ok.

[1]: this is clearly true because the first time I got a visual upgrade, I had taken ayahuasca and had not yet learned the art of star watching. instead, visual upgrades seem to be directly connected to the quantity of DMT in your head. the more DMT I have, the more I perceive. additionally, I have received visual upgrades in other moments of feeling better, and that is likely because feeling better makes serotonin, and I'm pretty sure serotonin gets synthesised into DMT. so a sudden rush of serotonin from smoking weed or mdma would also be able to produce visual upgrades, as long as you have a circuits which are capable of allowing/perceiving the faster speed (higher frequency) signal.

[2]: I know this is true, because whenever I go to sleep, they maintain me at full consciousness while slowing down my brain. then, they can snatch away my consciousness to make sure I am not conscious in a less focused state. it sounds like a hissing sound, and it pulls my consciousness away in a rapid manner. or, for example, in the morning I will often wake up from a dream, to which suddenly there will be repeated hissing sounds as they are trying to take my consciousness away. in any moment that I'm not being held in consciousness, or focused in the physical, I begin immediately to have hallucinations (which is sort of like if the chaos of a noisy signal became manifest). I believe that I can learn to control those hallucinations and make them useful to me just like tesla did, however I'm not given the chance to gain control of my mind in that way yet.

[3]: if you follow the pattern that it's always going to be the hidden space between you, and what you are looking at, while at the same time realising the physical property of how it works, where it's the number of bounces the light has bounced before entering the lens, you can see where this is going: a flat photo only shows you the light that has reflected off of the 3d space and then entered the lens. once I began to perceive the space between me and what I was looking at, now you can imagine this as two bounces of light before entering the lens, where the second bounce is "the space between" -- right, so in the next one, I will be able to perceive 3 bounces of light, which would look in nearly any direction I wanted to perceive. obviously, no human right now can perceive that way, so it'll have to be simplified. once they figure it out, I'm sure they'll be able to make it so you can "fly" around me and perceive, once again only two bounces of light. (oh wait, that's 6d -- 5d would be looking in any direction around me, like I have eyes everywhere on my body). you get the point though: I'm sure they'll be able to simplify my perception in some way so you guys can see it too, and they can attempt to maintain control over me.

[4]: just as michael bay can put a different hue on the movie's syntax with his visuals, the audience that believes his visuals more, believes the message his visuals convey. so, he attracts an audience that will appreciate those visuals and their message. likewise, nosebook can put a different spin on my perception with their authority. those who believe in their authority more, believe their power their authority conveys. they attract an audience that will appreciate their authority (and control). this is why, I can having so much success defining my own perception now, because I no longer believe in the authority they have over my perception. (the "train" outside agrees with me, btw (lol))


### 2019-03-01 19:12 - visual and social introversion / extroversion

just now I was responding to a reaction I had where I wanted to illustrate that I think that a person is not only introverted or extroverted -- but both. I think this happens with sensory stimulation and social stimulation.

I think that presently the reason (amongst others) that I am socially introverted, stems primarily because not only does nosebook want to control conversation I have with people, but because I cannot be visually introverted. all of my internal sensory perception has been shut down, so that instead of discovering my internal universe, I instead rely on other things external to me for this stimulation, such as drugs and stars.

I believe that human evolution is a constant swapping back and forth between these two. socially I would be introverted while sensorally I am extroverted, observing, collecting data, sifting and sorting, and finding the components I need to create a satisfying inner universe.

... to be continued ...

(this doesn't make a whole lot of sense without the idea of creative / sexual energy as the foundation of this inner universe)

(additionally, the idea works better with visual/social introversion/extroversion rather than all of the senses, because -- well, I don't know why. it just seems to be easier to understand because we don't tend to think of introverted senses, but we can conceptualise the difference between imagination and vision)


### 2019-03-03 23:56 - I don't care any more

I really hate going to sleep on nights like this because I can feel huge amounts of tension around all of the different tests and stuff that they want to do on me while I'm asleep.

I didn't realise it at the time, but I felt strongly like I wanted to go for a walk this morning, and as it turns out somehow I managed to get a pretty significant vision upgrade without watching stars or any drugs or anything externally to me.

this represents a pretty big milestone for me because I've been saying for a while now that vision upgrades are a product of releasing resistance more than anything -- and this is proof.

it looks like anyone can get vision upgrades just by releasing resistance. to illustrate what I mean, take the example of meditation. when you quiet your mind, so that you are not thinking any thought, you are no longer thinking resistant thoughts, and so your brain speeds up a bit, your head produces more DMT and you will feel better.

a similar thing happens with some drugs, but the result is a bit different. when you meditate, it's like traveling through a wide empty space where you cannot feel how fast the car is going. then, still going that speed you return back to your life (the mountain road) and quickly become aware that if you are not more cautious, you could crash pretty easy. sometimes you crash, but after recovering from the impact, often times the speed was so exhilarating, I got addicted to how that feels -- just like a real life person who enjoys the adrenaline rush of driving fast on a dangerous road.

drugs though are much more an out-of-control experience, and they do help you to learn to drive fast, but usually with more frequent accidents. so, it's easy to push against drugs and say that isn't the way, but for me it was only the illumination of the path, not the actual journey. the actual journey, I found is really only realised without the drug experience, whether that's stimulants, sex, or whatever.

I have already made the decision to focus harder than usual, and my goal is to eventually reach the "straight-edge" zone, and I'd like to even take it a little bit further, removing even food, and if possible water as well. like a star in the sky I want to be able to produce all of the elements I need, and have such an abundance of them, I can freely spew them all directions into empty space, knowing that somehow they will coalesce and attract into becoming the building blocks of new planets and stars.

---

this kind of creates a bit of a problem for nosebook because if I watch stars and get a vision upgrade, they can say, "oh, we don't want him doing that." -- or, if smoke weed and get a vision upgrade, they can likewise say, "oh, we don't want him doing that." -- but what if I can do it without those conditions? what if I can do it, even with them making tests on me at night and draining me of my energy. what if I can still find a way of coming into alignment with myself despite their best efforts to make that impossible?

this is, precisely what Iim setting out to do. it's rather difficult for me because, like I mentioned in the beginning, I feel all kinds of tension around the stuff they want to do whilst I'm asleep.

so, does my going to sleep anyway mean I'm ok with things and I'm accepting it? I certainly do *not* want them to be doing that while I'm asleep, so I'm in no way agreeing or consenting to their actions, it's just I don't really have many sustainable options -- and unless I want to live the rest of my life ultra-paranoid and in isolation, I have to just accept that there is really nothing I can do about what happens while I'm unconscious.

the only thing I can do, is to continue to find my alignment with who I really am, and not the resistant frequencies they are putting in my head. so, when I'm awake and conscious, I'm essentially doing a sort of real-time conscious meditation in the sense that I'm consciously rethinking resistant thought.

whenever abraham talks about this subject, they say something like you could stop resistant thought with a lobotomy -- which is removing your frontal-lobe, essentially taking away your humanness, and your ability to navigate time with your conscious choices, returning you to be similar to an animal function and capabilities again. so, they suggest that we meditate to stop that resistant thought (curvy roads) and get into the clear open space and let your car go faster.

---

learning to navigate this consciously is kind of an interesting experience because -- well, I'll tell more about it later, but for now I imagine that we're going to enter a new phase of discovery. likely, they will attempt to make my conditions as difficult as possible to achieve my alignment with what I want, but I'll still find a way of doing it, and most impressively with the most difficult conditions.

I have no idea what all of this means, cause from my perspective, this is just a big game to me where I have to keep finding the way forward, and it's most impressive for me to kind of see what I'm actually capable of... I remember how many times I've thought how good things look, and it couldn't possibly be better, but then I find a new one that's better. soon, that same method will be applied to my physique. I'll say to myself, "dang, there's no way I could possibly look better than than I do right now" -- and then I'll find a way :)

or, with anything really. that energetic process I have learned with the stars can be applied to anything. watch how I begin to utilise it to find all sorts of improvements I couldn't even perceive to be possible (usually though, beginning with a weird feeling, then a vague idea of how they might be butter, and then finally discovering its improvement, and letting that "surprise and delight" me).


### 2019-03-05 15:15 - extraterrestrial earth mini-series

this morning I was thinking about my present situation. I really dislike getting new inserts and having my abilities limited, and this was in relation to a previous thought I was having where I was thinking about andrea and how she wanted to have sex. she chose me as her target initially but marcos kept saying no, not yet or delayig the thing. so, she found someone else to begin her sexual liberation with.

this breaks into two discussions I want to have. the first is how before this happened, I managed to "reject" andrea, in the sense that instead of just following her urges to go down to my room , I chose not to because I didn't really think it was a good idea to usurp marcos' authority on the matter. because I perceived him to be the "authority" over his daughter's decisions regarding her body, I decided to wait for im to give the ok.

andrea perceived that this was going to be essentially "forever" to wait for him and decided to take matters into her own hands. though this is similar to my present situation where I am forcing my vision improvement by watching stars and stuff, I actually perceive it to be more similar to the general public's situation. where the symbol of andrea is the general public and the desire of sex is the ability to see like I do or watch stars. I am quite sure that team nosebook has repeatedly told people to not watch stars, not look at the sun, and tries to hold people in low-quality visuals while you watch me steadily get better and better vision effortlessly nearly every day now.

I imagine that at some time in the future, someone will finally get tired of waiting for team nosebook (marcos) to finally approve of the thing/sex (stars), and take matters into their own hands just like she did. like andrea did for many others in their quest for sexual liberation, this person will show the world that it she can decide what to do with her body, no matter the restrictions any parent, guardian or authority tries to put on her.

---

thst's one way to see it, but another would be to perceive marcos again as nosebook and the thing as my visual capacity. should I just kind of pull back on the whole trying to force the visual capacity thing and just wait for nosebook to finally let me have something that's already mine? like andrea, I perceive this to be essentially forever in coming. I mean, if I'm right about what I think is happening, it would be never, or impossible for them to ever approve it.

in fact, the depression and malaise that I felt at the beginning of last year was because I believed that I didn't really want my visual capacity after all. the events of my life kept pushing me toward getting the visual capacity, yet I continued to believe that someone else could make a decision for me what I can and cannot do with my body.

and so, just like andrea when she finally decided that she was going to take matters into her own hands, she suddenly felt a return or her feeling of power and freedom. she felt good and the depression lifted. my situation is similar in the sense that I feel quite bad every time that I perceive these guys as having the capability to limit me, and quite good every time that I go and redefine the "power" nosebook has over me, and by watch stars or just with the releasing of resistance, I achieve yet another visual upgrade.

so, I imagine that my decision to take matters into my own hands and realise my own capability by releasing the resistant thoughts which grant nosebook the power, will actually give quite a few others visual liberation just like andrea did for so many others on the subject of sexual liberation.

---

ok, so the idea of malaise got me thinking about a steam that jon did quite a while ago and posted it to his youtube. it got a lot of things moving around in my head at the time when I had quite a lot of malaise myself -- so it was really good. but then I had this random idea pop into my head where I hold jon in quite high regard and so what if someone at nosebook suggested that he does a quick q/a stream on this. it's also just as likely that I attracted the stream with my own desire to get thoughts moving, or even other people who also hold jon in high regard (the people he streams to) seemed to want to hear his opinion on this subject, because one of the most common things for a programmer to lack is motivation, and even less have internal motivation like jon has [^1]. so, to be clear, I'm not claiming that is what happened; it was a transition thought, where if it was real, it would remind me of the steering that christof did to truman in the truman show movie.

in all of the scenes where truman would identify something he wanted, like the girl at the school (sylvia), or a trip to fiji, or whatever, christof would try to steer truman away from it by affecting the conditions, like trying to make him afraid of water, travel, etc.

so, I thought to myself, well, it's not like I'm *really* in the truman show. I live in a reality with other real people in real situations. my reality isn't 100% contrived like truman's is. meaning, other people still have to go to real work, make real food, etc. they are all living a real life, and are not just actors working in big truman show movie set.

---

that idea that we're in a big movie set reminded me of a conversation I had with frank where I told him that I was sure that aliens could tune into for perception and all of earth is basically like a tv show for alien species.

woah, I thought. we could all be living in a truman show, where the earth is the truman show movie set. that *REALLY* got me thinking. so, if all of this is a movie set, you would need to control it somehow. it could be controlled symbolically, so catch this:

imagine that "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI" is correct and some sort of blunder occurred when the creation of the universe took place (the demiurge in mckenna's story) and earth became a containment facility.

to understand this symbolically, nosebook would be the sirians, and I am to nosebook like earth is to the sirians. essentially, they figured out from various attempts that there is no way they could control me (steer the inhabitants of the earth to understanding their connection to source) effectively, the sirians turned earth into a production (just like nosebook did for me).

this makes me not only the star of the production, but the star of the production the producers are having nosebook produce to understand their circumstances a little better.

nice :) ... to be continued (obviously, there are a lot of implications to this idea) ...

[1]: the subject of motivation is one of the most common ones to be found on places like hacker news and stuff. for me it's all about energy management and a belief in one's creation. so, I believe this is actually one of the primary reasons why there are so many trends in programming, because if php (or nodejs, or elixir) is the hottest new thing, and you're using that, it helps with the belief -- even if you're making an app for door to door kitty litter delivery. additionally, there is a lot of energy around the trends because of the money invested by the people pushing them, so the trend is like free energy, and the programmer can ride off of that easier than they can improve their perception of their product in their mind.


### 2019-03-08 22:30 - taking no action

I talked with xander about mom's decision to move, and then he suggested that one of my options was to apply for the ssdi thing, which I told him I didn't really like the idea of a whole lot, even though I realise it is temporary. we ended the session with the idea that getting my own space would be a good thing for me to kind of begin to change my headspace a bit. then, yesterday while watching stars the idea of working with gary again was put into my head, which I didn't really like the feeling a whole lot about.

you see, one of the things that has become increasingly apparent to me is the amount of effort put in opposition to what I want (which is to reconnect with who I really am). I'm held in a pretty disconnected state pretty regularly. I realise that even my disconnected state is now more connected than most people, but that's not the point I'm trying to make here. what I'm saying is that because I'm in a disconnected state and it's difficult to feel the way I actually feel about something, I am in the process of making a transition into using less and less of my physical body.

for example, if I thought about girls in certain circumstances, like the idea that came up where the girls (from the future?) were going to kind of take over or something, then my body would feel really good and it would feel like the funny feelings you get when you're young and in love for the first time -- a physical sensation. most likely fake, and a feeble attempt from nosebook to convince me of a reality they want [^1].

I have grown to understand that quite a bit of the physical sensation (in relation to emotion, not touch) that I feel is not really all that real. so, instead of relying on physical sensation in my body, I have noticed that I've moved to a more non-physical "knowing" that I kind of had as a child, but I didn't really know how to control. additionally, I've found out that a lot of the "receptivity" that I have is hugely beneficial because I'm beginning to "think" in non-physical -- and the time it takes me to "think" about whatever is actually the time it takes me to tune into the idea I'm looking for.

it's very open-ended, because almost anything or any idea can be found, so what I'm doing while tuning is searching for something that resonates with what I want. I have quite a few questions regarding this capacity, as it seems that all things are equally "true" -- and therefore this non-physical "thinking" mechanism is more of a reality creation mechanism.

I'm really enjoying the practice that my present circumstances are giving me at utilising this new mental faculty, and I'm actually really not wanting to try and effort something with ssdi or some other lame physical action.

so, as a result, I will be taking no action. ssdi doesn't feel like what I want, so because I'm supposedly being "forced" to make a choice, I will instead make none, and let them do the forcing. my circumstances are giving me the practice that I want with this new creation technique, and as evidenced by my star watching, I'm getting pretty low resistance, too. so, because almost all action feels now primitive and powerless to me, I do not even wish to try.

instead I will dedicate all of my attention to improving my energetic output. I can identify numerous things that can easily be improved, and if you were to ask me if I was ready I would most certainly say no.

for me, the value that my present circumstance provides as a method for gaining the most self-control[^2] is well worth the difficulty. I have no intention of attempting to do anything different. since I'm taking no action they must attempt to control me, which will give me even more practice at being self controlled :)

as I gain more energy output, I will become more unstoppable than I already am, so much so that even nosebook is going to have to take a careful look at the thoughts going into my head, lest they become manifest. what I mean is, I see the future actually as one where nosebook is having to play defence more than than offence, controlling instead the thoughts of those around me. my practice on gaining more self-control will be essential to me for not manifesting complete disaster.

[1]: it may have backfired a bit on them though, because it got a lot of people believing that this would be happening this spring, which if you combine it with the other understanding that I will be waiting until I go up a dimension and get things under control, it could be inferred that nosebook inspired a lot of people to believe that I would be going up a dimension soon for that to be true. if that were to be the case, I would prefer it to instead be spring next year, as that'll give me a whole year of star watching and a chance to get a handle on the new dimension a bit. it may also give nosebook enough time to figure out the signals, and start trying to limit/control me again, which will cause me to lose energetic control again and so I will go back to gaining more levels.

[2]: self-control is an interesting idea, as it essentially means a total revamp of my logic, definitions, and the value of an idea. it is a complete change in my personality, because as you will recall, one of the most attractive things about me previously was my lack of self-control. I was able to do nearly anything because I had no control to tell me otherwise. the girls liked the idea that I was so easy to accept their ideas, nosebook thought of me as a naïve child and wanted to control and exploit me as such, hoping I would never grow up. nowadays, I can appreciate these attempts to control me, as they have built in me a new ability to be self-controlled.


### 20§9-03-09 01:07 - you gatta want it

in a previous entry, I discussed the idea of how I yielded to marcos' authority over andrea's body and how likewise this is similar to what is happening in relation to star watching. well, the previous entry also reminded me of this example as well, in that by making no action, I am in a sense yielding to them, allowing them to ultimately make the decision upon what they want to do (or, as in the case with marcos/andrea, marcos was waiting until he could control the situation around it).

this got me thinking a whole lot more about it today as I anticipate that at some point in time, someone will finally say, ok I've waited long enough, this appears to be an indefinite fight between kenny and nosebook, so I'm taking this into my own hands. there are a few ways to look at it, but I like most the idea that I'll keep them pretty busy with my energy gaining, allowing you guys to get a pretty good head start before they have the resources to limit everyone.

as we've seen, I imagine there will be huge backlash from them, as this would probably be their worst nightmare: not just one person that's superior to them, but a whole bunch of people.

---

I assure you, and will be demonstrating throughout this year, that their power is only perceptual -- meaning you have to believe that they have power for them to actually have that power.

in a sense, by repeatedly taking no action, I'm allowing my desire to transform. they will continue to put me in circumstances that are not wanted, allowing me to continually clarify my desire further toward what I *really* want. each time this happens, I gain more clarity (and therefore a stronger sense of direction) toward what it is I really want.

it's difficult to put into words, but it'd be like a realisation of what/who/all of me that I really am, while at the same time the confidence to control it, and feel comfortable with it, like it's my second nature.

hopefully, one day I will demonstrate this physically, and hopefully you (anyone who wants it) can as well[^1].

as we move forward, I will begin giving my best motivation toward the realisation of your own power (your own personal empowerment). they have the capability to observe what is happening in our brains, and for them that is perceived control. they also have the ability to affect the electrical environment as well, but that also is perceptual in the sense that once you learn how to get any energy moving in the direction you want it to go, it's just more energy.

so, the very worst that could happen, is that a bunch of people who perceive themselves to be superior, get intimate insight into the minds of millions of people who are finding their way toward alignment with themselves. we will all be the realisation of their worst nightmare -- until, that is, that they too can do the same.

universal superiority doesn't exist any more than black is universally superior to white. superiority is perceptual, and determined by the conditions, so it's something that anyone/noone can achieve (yeah, I think that's why they want to control the conditions so much).

I have this mental image (feeling) that I'm beginning to practice and it's this realisation that they trapped all of us into this network to try and control us, but they didn't realise that the system they designed to control the conditions would actually create a new environment where we're all going so fast, it kind of creates a situation like in middle school where the teacher is the slowest person in the class. or, maybe like someone small trying to walk a very big dog, and the dog is clearly setting the pace.

[1]: I would find it quite humorous if the guys at nosebook, with such a strong sense of superiority, all say to themselves watching others steadily achieve more and more resonance with who they are, "no, I cannot stand the idea that someone (other than me) could have such power! I *must* come into alignment with myself first, before them!" :D


### 2019-03-11 14:37 - CAWK: COALITION ADVOCATING for the WELL-BEING of KENNY

the last few days after having a dream with pepsi product placement, I had been pondering an idea where now that I have a guardian (mom), someone can cash in on the advertising. previously I could not ask for my share of the ad-revenue, because for me the the network doesn't exist, so they can easily claim that a non-existent entity does not need to pay me. however, mom does clearly know about the entity, and can easily ask for those dividends.

however, I began thinking that perhaps mom will just fall into line just like she has been doing this whole time -- they'll lowball her and she'll just go along with it. so, I thought maybe greg should take that over, but then again he has lower self-worth, and I feel he probably imagines that he could do it, but doesn't actually believe in the successfully pulling it off[^2019-03-11 16:27]. it still didn't feel right, so I slept on it.

when I woke up yesterday, I realised what I wanted was a shark. I had no interest in actually obtaining any of that money myself. what I want are people that are driven by money, and they would cash in the ad-revenue with the objective of increasing the amount of contrast.

upon further inspection, I realised tat they would indeed want to advocate for my well-being, because it's hard to sell ads utilising the mind of a disturbed person. however, I've begun to recognise that my well-bing does not come so much from physical possessions, and the well-being that I receive is actually because of my frame of mind (the "framing" I put on my own perception). so, that's not it.

ok, well, what about the aspect that it would be kind of another way to make nosebook "pay" for their actions, and it would seem to me like they have a money-shortage consciousness, so that would fall right in line with their expectations for reality -- EXCEPT, I remembered the one story abraham tells about the man with an ex-wife asking for a percentage of his earnings, and tat the more ex-wives he had, the more desire there would be for him to make more. following that, the more money sharks I have collecting nosebook ad-revenue on my behalf, the more ads (and therefore ad-revenue) they would be attracting on my behalf.

maybe not what I was looking for.

(there was the side-intention for me as well, because I had begun to select different people that have been influential in my formation as the "re-realisation of saturn" (more on this later), and would appreciate a monetary reward for their influence. they were selected based on components of meaningfulness of the reward, ability to convert money into more desire/energy, and faithfulness to hold nosebook accountable)

---

I woke up this morning and I could tell that the idea no longer felt good to me at all, and so I would have to taking no action, again. seems I'm getting a hang of this no action thing after an idea that feels good to me gets shat on.

in the end I realise that no action is the best way, and doing something to make someone "pay" for something isn't the right way (for me), so I will go back to where I was, because what I really want is self-control.

### 2019-03-11 15:25 - another look at self-control

I have noticed that as I release resistance, I become capable of manifesting more and more things. this is really good, if I want to become similar to source energy or if I want to realise a new galaxy or universe sometime in the future. consider the wide variety of things that can be seen by the sun. a wide variety of wars, periods of enlightenment, and all sorts of thing wanted and unwanted have been realised in this solar-system.

similarly, source does not discriminate or label things as good or bad in the way that we do. energy is considered energy, and its effect is considered in a much broader perspective than just the immediate present.

so, as I release more and more resistance, I will become capable of more and more things (both which are considered "good" and "bad")

brb... need break


### 2019-03-11 16:27 - self-sabotage and why manifestation may not work some times.

I have given a lot of thought as to why I some things manifest and some things don't. for example, there have been many times where I have felt like I could program something, imagined its result, and then sat down to do it and nothing... or I couldn't find motivation to do it. or, what about the times that I wanted to destroy someone's car cause I felt so frustrated. again, I feel like I can do it, I imagine it's "successful" completion, but nothing comes of it. I have many times pondered why this is so, because it's one of the main questions a programmer has as to why they feel such lack of motivation toward a project or whatever.

well, in all case for me, those programs may have seemed like a good idea at the time, or someone motivated me to feel like I wanted to do it, but it wasn't what I *really* wanted to create. this is why when I lose motivation, I always take a step back and wait for the evolution of that desire, to bring clarity to what it is that I really want.

if you think about LOA and how it works, I'm sure that greg is in fact *capable* of being a cutthroat douchebag, but it's probably not what he *really* wants. so, under normal circumstances, he would be capable, but because he is conscious enough he will essentially self-sabotage his own "carnal" desire, knowing that it wasn't what he *really* wanted.

you can see that his connection to who he really is, actually helps someone to self-sabotage. the solution is *not* to just push through and force something that you do not feel internal motivation toward.

it's kind of a backwards way of looking at things, where the person that is most conscious, can often self-sabotage in moments where external motivation has been used as a tool to override one's internal guidance (inspiration).

---

I believe one of the main goals of the people trying to gain control is to be able to motivate someone in the direction that they want the person to go. the more connected the person is to who they really are, the less capability someone will have to motivate someone toward something that does not harmonise with who they really are.

in a military type situation where someone needs to blindly follow orders, this intention to want to control or motivate someone to perform the actions from the commands from the person in charge, may work (well?). so, you could imagine that maybe that is actually intended that soldiers, and people who don't follow orders are to be as disconnected as possible, in order to be able to easily motivate them.

I believe some time in the future, there will be a complete 180° change of opinion that orders need to be followed, and that self-sabotage is bad. we're no there yet though :)


### 2019-03-11 23:06 - another look at self-control (part two)

having now a bit of distance to where I can look a bit in the rear-view mirror, I think what might have happened, is I had the idea to tell mom and greg that they should collect on my ad-revenue, but then once again while I was asleep, someone shat on the idea... maybe they put ideas in my head that mom or greg aren't capable, or something -- I don't really know, but if yo could imagine nosebook not wanting to pay ad-revenue on product placement, it certainly would give them quite a bit of motive to try and rearrange my thoughts on the matter to cause doubt. I suppose we'll never know, cause there's no way to know what they're putting in our heads while we sleep, and we have no idea what sort of thought responses they have programmed in their systems. they'll never tell us, either, I can assure you of that.

the next thing that I want to mention is that this may have also been a composite reaction as well. this whole self-control subject has come as a response to the original thing that I talked about with xander last week. the same thing happened where I felt a good idea, but after some time, that idea[^1] no longer felt good to me. it felt like someone decided they would find a way to try and control me by adjusting conditions.

I decided then, like I did after the ad-revenue idea stopped feeling good, to go back to not taking action. so then, later when I was arriving to the conclusion while writing, things again probably got "motivated" or "steered" in a different direction. then, I began to write about how big of a mess motivating someone would make, and how little sense it makes, as a kind of a sidebar to the conclusion to my self-control concept. the irony is plain once you see the big picture here.

---

yesterday when I was went out to go for a walk with mom, I saw the neighbour and her girls. I felt a sense of timidity and didn't really want to be o social. instead, I launched off on some tirade about my visual capacity with mom. when I came home, I arrived to the conclusion that girls terrify me. in fact, nearly everything about any sort of relationship does at the moment. I don't really want to have any relationships at all at the moment.

the reason for that is because I don't have any self-control (yet). additionally, I'm deeply paranoid[^2] as well, so my only real solution right now is to continue to focus on my own self-control.

by taking no action, I am putting myself in reaction/response mode, so that means they must move things around to try and figure out ways to control me. each time they try (like david), I have another opportunity to learn self-control and to begin redefining my reality yet further, so that I remain in control, no matter the circumstances.

you see, what this is all leading to, and what the objective of all this self-control is for, so so that I can provide a stable platform for when I actually reconnect to who I really am.

like abraham says, alignment is not like a college degree in that once you have it, it's yours forevermore -- so, in order to keep my alignment with who I really am, it is imperative that I provide a stable environment where I am not able to be manipulated so easily by nosebook (or anyone else).

it's quite possible that in other timelines the girls would have inspired in me a lot more stability -- because in their presence, I would have continued to be in fun-mode. however, you could imagine that when they reached puberty or I was alone, things could go awry very quickly. the energetic intensity, plus my immature and untempered nature (in addition to my lack of resistance) would likely cause more problems than anything.

so, as it stands, and you may or may not agree with me -- I believe the best path for me right now is to continue to not take action whilst the idea doesn't feel good, continuing to practice self-control [^3].

[1]: the one of me going to live on my own would be a mental space change where I would begin to think like a person who lives by theirself

[2]: for example, today I met a guy named david, and considering that only nosebook people can really have a conversation with me, he was disguised as a christian (with a teddy bear on his backpack and everything). well, later when watching stars, it felt to me like nosebook wanted him to waste my time as much as possible on the bridge. my immediate reaction was to throw rocks at him. fortunately, in real-life I'm not quite as amped up as I am when I watch stars so that is unlikely to happen, but just the same, I will have to practice new ways of telling people I'm not interested in talking to nosebook empployees. he did inspire (like frank) some interesting thought though, so we'll see where that goes, I guess.

[3]: if you recall the triads of the sirian guide, vulcrum was the base, saturn was the second male in the triad, and sekmet was the female. since I already identify with volcrum (limp leg, 5th ray, creates things for zeus, etc.), that makes two of us already in the same body. 1st ray and 5th ray (desire and emotion) operate on frequency and harmony, so they're missing the logic tools or structure (3rd ray) to make make effective and and long lasting creations. the missing factor has been this saturn guy (3rd ray). people such as zaryn, marcos and augusto have kind of fit this saturnian role up, and since 2016, nosebook has had the saturnian role. however, it is time for the re-realisation of saturn. I have given it quite a bit of thought, and this process I'm going through is actually the preparation phase for that. you may have noticed how carefully I have been studying these saturnian archetypes, and I plan to emulate them to the best of my ability, redesigning all of the parts that I see fit for improvement.


### 2019-03-12 01:11 - faith as a precursor to manifestation

one of the interesting things about the conversation I had with david was the concept of faith being the ability to "see" something that is not yet physically manifest. after that, I presented the concept of faith as a transformation:

1. hope
2. belief
3. knowing

the key element there was the belief one, where I gave the example of you can believe a gun can shoot because you know gunpowder burns quickly, the casing of the bullet holds in the pressure of expanding gunpowder until finally the bullet shoots out at a rapid speed. I briefly mentioned the idea that logically you can arrive to the conclusion that putting the elements of a bullet together and igniting the gunpowder will create a fast moving projectile, so logically you could believe that this bullet thing would work that way. this is the mind of an inventor.

hope has no logic to make it true and is about as good as "chance". however, when you get to belief you can logically make some connections which will allow you to believe something (good or bad). knowing however has experience to back it up. this is not theory any more, but an exercise of one's expectations.

the other thing I thought was interesting which I mentioned was the concept of faith having a visual component, where one can see something not yet physically manifest. in my experience, whenever this happens to me, whenever I see something not yet physically manifest (that is, in 3d space as if it were real), it comes from the capacity to feel the presence of that thing.

this capacity is what I have been talking about with the inner universe, and the ability to create objects in 3d space by *feeling* them. I imagine that nosebook has done this believing part for you guys by figuring out what concepts to put in my head to make the thing appear in your imagination. so, I guess it's not really a big deal for you guys to have to believe in the thing, because nosebook does it for you.

this faith component is really the capacity to feel the presence of something not yet manifest. so, actually now that I think about it, you guys could probably utilise nosebook's service to fuel your faith. I'll elaborate on this in the future (this topic is just getting started), but you can think of your imagination as a two-way street. the same way that you can generate pictures in your mind (nosebook calls them hallucinations I'm sure) simply by having a strong feeling, having a detailed image your imagination can make you feel something.

also, and this is just a test for now, try to take elements you visualise in your imagination and logically arrange their interactions, so that it's no longer a static image but a living thing. you should, like tesla with his motors be able to return at a later time and find them still functioning. any programmer can easily test this by visualising a computer, and tren writing a simple hello world program that prints out the time. come back later and it should still be printing the time. congrats, you just made a persistent mental clock.


### 2019-03-14 02:58 - here's to the next detail level :)

happy pi day, and I really am looking forward to the next visual level. I'm going to sleep now then greg will enter my room and install more stuff in my body in effort to try and prevent me from actually enjoying life.

I really enjoy having an enhanced sense of hearing, sight, taste, and touch.. it really bothers me quite a bit to go to sleep at a time like now because I know I'll wake up and it'll all be blurry and dull again -- but, I know it'll inspire in me the desire to get the next level with even stringer focus than before.

I suppose, if they didn't limit my capacities, I would just go straight-away up a dimension -- so instead, I get to take the more scenic route this way and continue to expand on the detail this dimension has to offer.

meh! I'll try to "enjoy the journey", but meh! I really want to see good!

my vision now is in my opinion even "worse" than it was before.. because before, it was always blurry -- but now, for a brief microsecond after I move my eyes and focus on something new, I can see the world crystal clear (like REALLY REALLY REALLY awesome perfect edges clear), but then it immediately blurs up right after.

I suppose I should work on trying to improve the strength of my eyes so that they can focus more strongly, but I think I'm already doing that, so that's why they have to install more inserts in me at night. you could imagine that each one can only handle x amount of power passing through it, so they need more of them distributed around my body to continually force my eyes' blurriness with a stronger and stronger signal every time (they're just microscopic bits that operate like signal reflectors, so like a transformer, only so much current can pass through it).

therefore, I imagine that eventually they're going to come up to a limit somewhere. I suppose too that every time this happens, I'll achieve yet stronger focus still, and a new visual level, until that limit is reached. I have no idea how long it'll take, and if there are even limits for my ability to focus.

meh!


### 2019-03-15 21:51 - checkmate? I doubt it...

the other day at sam's I had an outburst telling mom she needs to collect money from nosebook as ad-revenue, then yesterday jamie(?) came over to aid mom with jaron's disability and mom told her that I think someone is looking through my eyes and that I she should collect money from them, not from disability -- but she said she doesn't know what I'm talking about. the words stuck in my head and I raelised that she could claim that she doesn't know what I'm talking about, but greg definitely knows about it, because if she's doesn't know about it, jaron's clearly not installing new devices, and since greg is awake when I get new devices installed, it has to be greg. right? well, greg could just deny it, of course, but then I'd just make sure I sleep with my door strung up and locked and my computer streaming to twitch the video of the door (to see if someone come's in it). I figure that they need to install new ones multiple times a week now, so that it doesn't get too far out of their ability to control the amount of energy, so even in the ultra-severe case that they need to stage some sort of disaster and put me unconscious, they would have to do that at least multiple times per month -- or hospitalise me in some way.

there are no good outcomes left for nosebook in this sense.

---

however, I was merely reacting to my circumstances: I wanted to have good coffee, and I felt it was unfair to hold me in a state of poverty, while at the same time making it impossible for me to get a job, or acquire money in any way. no no way did I intend for this to be a checkmate scenario, and I don't see it as such, either. let me explain.

in order for me to move forward with my life, I want to be in control of what is happening. this essentially requires full disclosure of what is happening inside of my head, and the ability to modify it as I see fit. obviously, this is completely incompatible with nosebook's plan to keep the extent of their surveilance a secret.

it's never going to happen.

let's take the optimistic scenario that they finally concede and tell me that they want me to do whatever. I'm obviously going to respond by saying, "I see no reason to change a thing. in fact, I am actually doing right now what I want to be doing. I don't get the full manifestation of being able to see clearly through my eyes or using my visual capacity, but it's not a problem."

you see, the whole thing that was the "checkmate" aspect, which I did not anticipate is that if I lock my room at night, there will be nothing nosebook can do to prevent me from gaining enough power to finally have my visual capacity and go up a dimension.

---

the reality is, I'm not actually all that ready to go up a dimension yet, so it's not really all that much of a problem. a few months ago, I would have had a different opinion on this issue, perceiving that in some way nosebook was actually hindering my performance.

in reality though, as evidenced by my humble pi entry: @[entry](2019-03-14 02:58), I the only hinderance was my own perception of their ability to hinder me. meaning, if they keep installing new devices or not, it doesn't seem to affect my ability to gain new detail levels. so..

if my performance is not affected, I see no reason to change anything. all of the resistance and tension I felt was a product of my own perception, and so to force nosebook into whatever, by forcing a new dimension as an attempted means of escape from my own perception of their tyranny, seems, entirely silly now.

it seems, I really have come half-circle on this... lol, that's 180°, and it happened on pi day, which is (literally) half he circumference of the circle, per unit radii :D


### 2019-03-16 ??:?? - the solution to increasing human energy

I imagine a situation where nosebook says they cannot afford to pay out ad-revenue because they're bleeding cash. the first thing that comes to mind is the amazon way of doing things, being famously unprofitable while reinvesting all money into expansion. meaning, there's a reason why it took facebook so long to expand into 3rd world countries, and when they did, they had the idea that facebook would be considered "internet" to the people who don't know any better. clearly this is more of a (market) control move, than a profit margin move.

then, after that falls on deaf ears, I would probably ask the question, "ok, how much are you spending just in effort to keep kenny away from his visual capacity."

it's probably quite considerable.

---

what if it's actually part of the plan. I'm going to recount a bit of a work of fiction I've been mulling over in head for a while now.

a famous guy wrote a monumental paper on the problem of increasing heman energy. we'll call him niki. anyway, he approaches the problem (like I did at first) from a physical perspective, beginning with some calculations of mass and velocity, and finishes off with some practical solutions which he thought could provide what now has been termed "abundance" (as defined in the book jori gave to me) ... if we could provide his kind of abundance we could increase human energy, he concludes.

[going to read it again before continuing]


### 2019-03-20 20:54 - becoming more non-resistant

this morning I had a series of dreams where it was almost as if I was to select some girls for some future relationship or something. anyway, I don't remember much about it, but I do remember that seemingly increasingly younger ones seemed attracted to me.

so much so, in fact, that I had a series of reactions to it almost as if I were trolling nosebook, by trying to push the limits to the absolutely impossible extreme... although that would be something that I would do, I believe they're missing the point here.

in my dream state, I have much less resistance. that's why I'm able to answer questions that normal-resistant kenny wouldn't answer. in fact, in my less redsistant state, I'm capable of a whole lot of things I'm not capable of normally -- like creating objects and scenes in 3d space with my mind; that's something that seems to be only possible in a lower resistant state.

I want to achieve that low of a resistance in reality though, because I want to be able to use my visual capacity -- so I continue to lower my resistance. additionally, the less resistance I have, the less conflict I have, because there's nothing to push against. all of the anger and frustration is just evidence of resistance, and as I reshape my mind to see things as just energetic relationships, the traditional "meaning" to them fades away.

it's just not possible to be OK with my present situation, unless I perceive it as energetic relationship.

this means that virtually everything is possible now in this lower resistance (dream) state because I no longer see age or gender or race or physical attributes. it should be possible for quite literally *anyone* to engage in a relationship with me (in my unresisted state) and it will play out in the format that best fits their expectations.

try it :) put me to the test: try a gay man. try a gay, disabled, ugly, diseased person and see what manifests... it should work.

---

additionally, the more I release resistance, the less nosebook has to control me with, and so for me to actually gain any freedom, it won't be from getting nosebook to change -- but from redefining all of my physical experience as energetic.

when that happens, I will perceive reality as source does. I will become "source-energy android" :)

coming soon...


### 2019-03-21 00:08 - becoming more non-resistant (followup)

#### why do I have to perceive my present circumstances as a system of energetic relationships?

if I perceive my circumstances through the lens that we are taught to perceive reality, the whole thing breaks down pretty quickly. there's a whole lot of stuff to feel bad about. that perspective looks like basically being imprisoned for life in someone else's crazy you can't do anything anymore because we own your head sort of thing. I don't really need to go into too many details, but everything that you come to rely upon in the human experience has failed me. my family clearly does not have my back. friends are not really friends. nothing that I was taught is real. I used to trust my emotions, but that has failed. none of my dreams are real. none of anything that I previously relied upon is left in the sense that people want to be in complete control of my physical experience.

we consider the physical experience to be the most real -- in fact, we rely on it so much for our existence, we call it reality, and we cannot really come to terms very well with the the idea that there are all sorts of realties, and our minds are very powerful at creating them.

nosebook puts signals in my head while I'm asleep with the goal of making a dream reality that they can sell to you guys, but they do not really grasp that it is just as "real" as anything else is. in this way, they want to be able to create anything they want inside of my head by figuring out the right combination of signals to make it happen.

in that sense it's a bit like a programming language or a syntax where each signal "means" something inside of my head. however, I think my "meaning" for these symbols must become the standard for all of your heads, too. when you think "boat", you are using the signal my brain has given to mean that thing that floats on water. to give it more definition, you are again using the same signals that my brain uses to describe the same thing.

you might think that's kind of nutzo that all of our brains are going to become uniform and all visualise with the same signals, but in my perspective it's actually kind of what I wanted.

I wanted to find a way of becoming the realisation of a new universe. nosebook wants to make that universe and have all of you guys use the same syntax so it can be tracked and recorded, so it works out. in order to make their plan work, they have to come up with a way of making my brain comprehend everything any human wants to visualise.

obviously, if I had a traditional form of preference, this wouldn't work because I would say, no I don't want any violent images, or no gay sex or something.

so instead, they no longer have the same "meaning" inside of my head that they do traditionally. if someone wants to picture a violent image, he (or she) may perceive it as a symbol of power, and the components which make up that image are just signals or syntax which describe the "scene". same with any other thing.

---

now, you can imagine that inside of a universe a whole lot of things exist, and there are unwanted and wanted parts, but the entity which determines if it's wanted or unwanted (single-cell amoeba or human being), gets to decide. nothing is inherently always unwanted, and in fact, I am beginning to come to the conclusion that everything anyone could consider unwanted, is fact something wanted by something else (the entity which has determined it to be unwanted) cannot perceive...

---

so, you see, it's all going along just fine. nosebook has actually given me an adequate environment and the right amount of pressure to bring this about.

the reason why I have to see it like an energetic relationship is because I have become the syntax, not the story. having resistance to certain meaningful things, would be like a piece of paper refusing to have certain types of drawings/words on it.


### 2019-03-22 22:21 - two powerful mental abstractions

#### I AM the way that I AM

when speaking with david, he reminded me that the idea of I AM is symbolic of God. so, the quote by descartes, "I think, therefore I am" is not only a statement of sentience and recognition of one's existence, but a small shout-out to the idea that we are gods in flesh.

well, it just dawned on me that when someone says, "I am the way I am [and I'll never change]" they are essentially saying, "I am the way I perceive God to be [and He, like me will never change]."

#### the director perceives his audience as sympathetic with the protagonist

this was an idea that lindsay presented in the whole plate series, which impacted me greatly -- and it just dawned on me that we are essentially directing our own life movie, and so we will identify ourselves with the protagonist.

but then I thought, maybe not all people perceive themselves as protagonists, so it may be possible that some people would say, inside I'm a good person (the protagonist), but externally, I am the antagonist.

---

anyway, I want to develop these ideas further because they are both powerful tools. for example, if you see yourself as the director, and your life as the film, and the people around you as your audience, it closes the mental gap between the way you are and allows the protagonist or antagonist to have a character arc.


### 2019-03-25 11:07 - a theory for ben davidson

I've been thinking about his cosmic ray health alerts. I don't disagree that the effect is real, instead I was trying to think of its mechanism for the evolution of life on a planet. this is just an idea that popped into my head. I'll begin with the axioms

1. the sun emits more or less solar wind from time to time, and it seems that the more density, the stronger our magnetic field is. (speed and phi angle seem to affect rapid changes in the magnetic field)
2. while some may experience heart or psychological changes, as someone who stares directly into the sun (and other stars) and notices both of these effects regularly, it seems to me that these high frequency "rays" seem to provide me with an enhanced capacity for perception and higher amounts of creativity
3. we know that even in solar "minimum", large CMEs and strong solar wind can occur
4. imagine this solar wind as something the sun emits so that the planet can push against it and gain strength

so, imagine that there were a value that we could measure which represented creativity, technological advancement, or perception... I'll call this Q. [^1] Q is directly proportional to the Kp index over X unit of time.

so, when Q is high, there are a lot of advancements, and the earth's magnetic field is strong. (there is more of this creative energy flowing) and when Q is lower, the magnetic field weakens, and more of these cosmic rays begin to flood in. for some people, the impact of these high-energy, high-frequency particles, will manifest as a phycological condition, and for others it'll be a flash of inspiration or maybe even an upgrade to their vision/perception.

[1]: others have called this value different things, but the most notable to me is terence's "novelty theory". this theory does not supplant his theory but instead gives the sun the function if it's regulator.


### 2019-03-27 10:45 - the bigger picture

this morning I woke up from a dream where someone was very concerned about dying. I was explaining to this person that death is really not a problem at all and is one of the best experiences you could ever have. I began to explain how I saw the death transition when I was woken up (presumably because they don't like me becoming conscious in my dreams).

I explained that at first your imagination is activated in a way where you can create anything you want in 3d space, fly or whatever (what I would consider a normal dream, nowadays). so, if you perceived the afterlife to be something horrible, your imagination would create that and you would live that manifestation for some time. then things would begin to lose their physicality as you begin to perceive things more from an energetic (emotional) perspective on your return back to source. above that is the least physical of all, which is source (and now that I'm writing this later, I realise it's the subject of most of the seth material).

however, the more conscious of who you really are, the less of a transition this is, and so that when you go back into a body (usually as a baby), there is such a difference between that energetic perspective and the new physical one, you will forget the energetic one quickly. however, each time that you do, you come in with more energy.

so, earth essentially is being setup in such a way where a bunch of people who believe theirselves to be superior, can micromanage and steer the general population into all sorts of ways that will be generally "unwanted" (unless of course, you are one of their beloved and approved by them to be worthy of their benevolence).

this will create enormous contrast, because at the very get-go you have to serve some stupid regime or you get steered constantly away from your own connection. any time there is this much steering away from one's own guidance (take my life for example), it creates enormous desire to gain that consciousness of who you really are.

I will likely be the first, but when you do become conscious of who you really are, in physicality, you gain all of those capacities that the death experience has to offer, while remaining very alive.. the way this occurs is because your desire and your logic (structure) are non-resistant enough that having the energy levels of who you really are, in your physical body is still possible (you don't need to "die" or lose your physical body to become aware of yourself like this).

so that means this is a serious power-leveling planet now. people all over the world will be coming in with stronger and stronger energy from birth, come here to have amazing amount of contrast to bump that energy level up even higher, and each time they do, earlier and earlier on in their life they will become conscious of who they are. at the moment, I'm almost 36, but imagine if you could figure this out by the time you were 12. that would be nuts.

so anyway, in the really long-term, you will notice that the guys at nosebook will eventually also die too, so this will take many generations, but eventually the nosebook guys who wanted to exert their superiority will eventually gain enough desire to regain their own consciousness. the very very last holdouts, I estimate will be the ones to experience the "decline and fall of [their] empire".

it's totally all good :) let the power-leveling begin!


### 2019-03-27 14:06 - who is this "who I really am" guy?

before you are born, you are "who you really are" -- someone who is not limited by gravity, can create things in 3d space, and capable of seeing temporally many different possibilities of manifestations. this is your pure energy self.

when you are born, now you put into the physical experience and experience time and space from a singular perspective. this this "resistance" which allows for a singular focus, provides a pretty good starting spot to begin experiencing "contrast" -- things wanted and things unwanted. this "contrast" between what you want and what you thought you wanted[^1] will always inspire stronger desire in who you really are, and also physical you to realise that new desire. stronger desire equals more energy. you could say that if you were to tune into all of the energy of your desire right now, you would be the manifestation of who you really are (and your circumstances would be very different)[^2].

the goal really is to begin to let the person you are when you are "dead" through. the amount of energy that anyone has accumulated is much much more than this body could normally withstand, however, the more you are able to rearrange your thoughts to allow more and more energy through (or meditate), the more you realise the manifestation of who you really are.[^3]

[1]: your present situation is always an indicator of where you're tuned in to

[2]: actually, my theory of how it's possible to reverse engineer the individual resonant frequencies of each nosebook device is actually based off of this idea of "tuning" into who you really are. you take it one step at a time, feeling if there is resonance, and each time you the device responds to the input frequency, you know a part of the total frequency. it's actually easier than you think, because even if say it were a binary code (only two possible positions per digit), and there were 128 digits, you would only need to make 128 resonance tests to figure out the code. you can imagine that the number of possibilities for a reality is a whole lot bigger than 128 bits (there are so many possible variables), if it were a 1 thousand digit number, base 100, it would be impossible to brute-force the number (100^1000 possibilities), but you imagine that it would be possible in your lifetime to try out 1000 different things, each with 100 different outcomes. to find what you really are looking for you would have to make minimally 1000 and at most 100000 attempts to figure it out).

    fortunately though, the result of each life event will give you a feeling, and in it's most simple form, you could say that it feels "better" or it feels "worse" -- binary. so, you could remap that 100^1000 number into a base-two and get there the long, but sure way. imagine that 100^1000 is less than 2^16768 number (it probably is). now, you can be sure that with only 16768 life events, you can tune to who you really are :)

[3]: in "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI" he mentions this idea that the human consciousness was engineered as a trap. well, I don't know where I got this information (perhaps it was deleted from the original document) but I remember it saying that at first they were designed to be stupid, but it didn't work out so well, so if was finally decided that all the different alien species would contribute their best dna to the human project, and make a the most intelligent species ever. however, it would be limited in capability to their connection to source, and the source energy valve was activated by emotion. so, basically, the better you felt the more source energy would flow through, and the more energy there was flowing, the more these super-human capabilities become available. this was chosen as the best option to allow the INFECTED ONES (lol) to not be able to access their these capabilities until they were "rehabilitated" sufficiently to gain access to them. and now that I see it in hindsight, to inspire desire in them to regain their own connection instead of remaining enamoured with what the physical plane has to offer.

    meaning that, the human body is quite capable of withstanding the energy of who you really are -- you just have to tune your way there[^2] gradually. additionally, unlike the bodies that the "creators" used which got used up after 4000 years or whatever, there should be no such issue with the human body. as soon as you are allowing who you really are through, your capability to regenerate entire body parts (similar to jesus) will become available, as the body is really only the inflection point for the creative (source) energy to come through. same with the realisation of the manifestation of something you can perceive in 3d space with your imagination can become physical in the same way.


### 2019-04-01 22:48 - mega-conspiracy theorising

today I was explaining to jaron that when I first got 3d vision, I noticed that I felt like I was finally *inside* of my body. previously, it felt like I was experiencing life as if it were projected on a screen into my eyes. somewhere around the time I was in la vera, I stopped feeling so much *inside* of my body in this same way. it probably happened before then, but I hadn't noticed it. I will consider this experience being connected to who I really am.

obviously now I am once again seeing the world though a screen -- meaning I see the picture in my eyes of my experience, just like everyone else sees my experience. it has become increasingly more apparent that the other parts of my physical experience such as hearing and smell are also controlled by them. essentially, just like when someone else tunes into my physical experience, they block out *your* physical experience as much as possible; this makes it so there aren't mixing of the your physical experience with mine, and to make it more immersive.

well, they do the same to me. they block out my physical experience, and then they transmit my own physical experience into my body, with things adjusted, so I don't hear as well as I really do, I don't see as well as I really do, smell, taste or touch, either.

---

ok, keep that in mind now while we down the rabbit hole a bit. so I'm telling jaron that whenever they turn off the machine, I will see a lot better immediately, but then it'll become way way way way acceleratingly better, and I qualified my opinion on this by saying that I have so much momentum right now, that even when I don't look at stars, I still get vision upgrades, and that's with them trying to hold my back, so with no longer a barrier holding me back, that will become such a tremendous force that who knows how good things will be after that happens.

then, I said something which surprised jaron, saying that I believe everyone[^1] will have this experience too, saying that likely what is happening is that people's imaginations are running at the speed of my vision, but the people that do not pay for an improvement in their vision are held at the visual level they were when they joined the network[^2]. this of course means that if they did not hold people's vision at the level it was when they joined the network, their vision would gradually, every time they use their imagination, tune their vision to the speed of mine. essentially, people would eventually run at my visual speed if nosebook didn't have a product to sell[^4].

well, when I was watching stars, I was thinking about this when it occurred to me that if you're a end-times buff, you would know that the whole weirdness of (besides the preparation of the bride of christ), it says that no one will know the time of his coming. well, the only thing that could disable the nosebook network like that would be a massive solar flare and CME. when that happens, nobody could know. immediately following that kind of event (24 hrs or so later, depending on the speed of the CME), there would be all sorts of crazy things happening in the sky, while at the same time, all of the people who's vision is being held back by nosebook will suddenly enter into a pretty insane version of reality. the amount of DMT in people's head will enhance their experience so much that it will become so hyper-realistic it'll be surreal.

the entire world will feel like I felt the day I achieved 3d for the first time and finally entered into my body and experienced the full HD tactile experience inside of my body. it'll be pretty amazing, I assure you.

me, I will have more the most insane experience of all, but don't worry. I'll be fine; I can handle my psychedelic experiences; I'm a pro. I'm sure that even now I will normalise the it so quickly that the new version of me which emerges will become so quickly assimilated into my experience, it won't be a problem. I'll likely feel like wow, this this what I *should* feel like, *naturally!*[^5]

---

ok, so I was thinking about how many people are actually using my imagination or if nosebook is expanding into 3rd world countries and not giving them the imagination upgrade as well. well, I think that there are a number of reasons as to why they would want to have the entire world use my imagination. shout outs to david for helping my realise this one.

I was talking with david about interpreting the symbols in the book of revelation by john and was telling him that we don't know the original symbols (or signals) that were inside of john's head when he had the dream. if you were to send the symbols (signals) of "kitchen" and "friends" into people's head while they were dreaming, many people would interpret those symbols very very differently. obviously a vision like the revelation of john was far more complex than two nouns, but the the interpreter (john in this case) will put a lot of their own present circumstance into the interpretation of those symbols. for example, if the interpreter is a woman that is constantly frustrated with her boyfriend's friends making a mess in the kitchen, that could be a very different dream than someone who loves to cook with their friends, etc.

so, then I realised some time later that it's quite likely that nosebook is interested in tracking everything that everyone is visualising, so they're probably converting the whole world over to my visual language, by putting everyone's imagination inside of mine.

another advantage to everyone using the same visual language, is that everyone will be using the same signals now inside of their dreams, and this is a powerful way to "steer" someone, because while asleep they are unresisted, and so reality seems very real and feels very good, so it's kind of like a way of planting different ideas in people's heads when they're not resistant to the idea. lots and lots of inventions have occurred with a realisation in a state of lesser resistance, whether that's in a dream, after a nap, or on psychedelic drugs.

you could imagine how much someone so fearful of the unknown, they might feel the need to track and try to control a lot of things. in a world where there are still a lot of unknowns for them[^6] you could imagine that they would want to try and steer certain things that are important to them. it would also be useful to try and make all sorts of different situations happen for them.

remember the idea I had giving people access to "the sims"[TODO: ref] like functionality of my brain. well, without that creative aspect to their brain, it looks like they're going to probably try and steer all sorts of things. they will have their favourite "machos" which meet their best "embras" as they steer people toward the situations they desire to be the audience of. they could do it instantaneously in their minds (or mine), but they don't live inside of my mind, they live in reality, so it motivates them to control and steer their reality as much as possible. I foresee this as the "contrast" which will bring about the "dollhouse" idea [TODO: ref] in the next era.

---

I imagine that the 1st world is 100% likely to be using my imagination. I less likely that "peasants" of the 3rd world is using my imagination: there are lots of them, and almost none of them have the money, so instead of putting them on the free (but most expensive for nosebook) plan, they'll just keep that part a secret, telling and offering only those well-off in the 3rd world a chance to use my imagination. I could be very wrong here, and I hope I am, because everyone on my imagination is creating a wider and wider frequential gap between where their imagination is and where their vision is, and whenever that solar event occurs, all over the world, everyone will have that amazing experience.

that event will most likely create a new timeline because different desires will go in different directions. couldn't really tell you much about that, however the side that my consciousness stays on... hold on lemme back up. actually, another day [^7].

until then though, I want to say that if you have my imagination, using it is like tuning yourself to a higher frequency. the more you do it, is kind of like pulling the rubber-band back further and further. even if nosebook is holding you to where you were when you joined, I would, if I were you, should spend as much time as I can there creating as many things as I could. the payoff will be greater later, as your imagination is (if it's like mine) a very high frequency, and this is maybe even more beneficial than socialising (which is tuning you to the frequency of the people you're socialising with) [^8]

good night.

[1]: I have no way of knowing how many people are using my imagination, but I imagine it should be pretty much everyone.

[2]: I didn't really realise it until after telling jaron this, but that makes all the sense why it's so costly for them every time I get a visual upgrade -- because it would be the extra power needed to run everyone's brain at that speed, plus the power needed to keep everyone's vision at the speed it was at when they joined the network, plus the cost needed to make sure that people are not hallucinating.

[4]: ironically, this is the most expensive product because just by joining the network, you by default get all the features my imagination has to offer. so, in order to make pricing tiers, they have to *disable* the features for the customeres who don't pay. this means that their free customers cost their development team quite a bit more time and effort to disable the features (plus maintenance costs), than the paying customers who just incur the maintenance costs of running the network. so, you have to then wonder why they're so aggressively expanding into third-world countries...

[5]: as I was writing this, I just had this strange moment where I had the realisation that I just made a pretty big claim. I (kenny) don't really know what to think or how to respond to it this, but it's what was on my mind and it's what I wrote... oh well, anyway, I guess we'll see.

[6]: I find this absolutely repulsive. they have essentially all of the resources they need: access to source energy through esther, nearly everyone's experience, and the ability to put their mind into relaxed and receptive states electronically, they could get the answer to nearly anything they desire to understand, yet it's because of their own resistance that they don't gain an understanding about the things they're so afraid of -- and mostly because it's because they're afraid they might be perceiving it wrong now -- which they most certainly are, which is why they feel resistance in the first place. so in order to not be wrong, they must continue how they are (as if it were right) and never change their perception.

[7]: wouldn't it be funny if the timeline split if all of the people that do not want for people that were connected to my imagination to have the "in the game" experience, get 3d, and see as good or better than I do presently -- and difference of desire creates a timeline split, where those wanting to remain superior and those in the 3rd world countries, (in their perspective) inherit the earth, and essentially everyone using my imagination basically dies. well ok, not really funny. I just like to play with these kinds of ideas :)

[8]: this is another realisation I had, following the symbols, where in piscis, the symbol moved toward group thinking, and the detriment was to stay in the previous symbol of sacrifice (or service). this era of aquarius, the symbol moves toward individual self-empowerment (capability), so the detriment will be to stay with old social and group empowerment ideas. someone will realise greater capability if they turn inward (self), instead of looking to others (group) for their empowerment. I don't want to tell people what to do, instead this is a reflection on my own experience and how I see the symbols changing for this era[^9]. [TODO: ref piscis era]

[9]: just as jesus came telling people aquarius is here, telling them of the freedom found in their own capability through self-empowerment (and was what likely snagged the powers of that time.. notice how how much nosebook is has the symbol slightly twisted with the only-nosebook capability for the "self"-emporwerment of "group" of nosebook). I too came with the dollhouse mentality, so the next era, I believe will be about the dollhouse, which is is why I think the present powers (nosebook), will twist the symbol and try and steer the population of the world as if it were their own creations (clones in the dollhouse idea)


### 2019-04-03 17:39 - rollercoaster (of love?)

the other day when I was talking with david, we were talking about control. there are some things over which you have little control, like your breathing, heart rate, digestion, salivation, etc. and you have more control over other things. we concluded on the idea that in the end, really life is *somewhat* like a roller-coaster, and all you really have control over is your reaction.

the reason why I say, *somewhat* is because your reaction is kind of your control. let me back up. previous to this, we were talking about how LOA works and you what you give your attention to. my experience has shown, for example, that today I have a variety of things happening in my life and I am reacting (responding) to them the way that I feel is then best response, and then tomorrow comes. since tomorrow has an infinite amount of possibilities to to things happening, what will occur. well, tomorrow will bring new things and all those things feel a certain way to me, and I have found that the things tomorrow has feel pretty similar to the things that have happened today. I conclude then, that since infinitely many things are possible, that temporal navigation is achieved emotionally[^1].

---

now, I want to expand on the dollhouse idea. imagine a future moment when we're a whole lot better at programming DNA. the world of programming machines has become less useful, as we're now more interested in getting our biology to behave the way that we want it to. you can imagine all sorts of reasons to learn how to program the DNA to achieve the cosmetic improvement you're looking for than it is to perform a surgery.

the reason why I say cosmetic is because I believe that in this day and age, sex is a larger motivating force than sickness -- so figuring out how to give someone bigger boobs without surgery would be a very lucrative thing. once that takes off, you could imagine that all sorts of structural changes could be made to the body by altering the DNA program a bit. I believe it could be even done electronically with a that has a bit more precision than the system nosebook already has in place (and without any splicing or anything like that).

we're not there yet though. humankind still has quite a ways to go before that takes place, but you could easily see what sort of environment this would produce: lots of test-subjects would need to be had to realise the kinds of desired physical attributes people may desire. well, the way to do that would be to make a whole lot of clones and test out the different DNA changes on them. also, while you're at it, why not make a wide variety of different clones and put them in contrived situations for entertainment purposes. I'm basically describing television of the future. clearly, people are going to get fed up with the "flat" television screen and will want to see all sorts of different extravagant lives that creative people could come up with, build the actors and the sets, and then the audience can watch it from the actor's perspective (and other cameras, too obviously), similar to how my life is but way more exaggerated, and fully contrived.

I say fully contrived in the sense that these actors will be controlled electronically[^2], and the early realisation of this idea will probably be similar to how a movie is shot today. later, the actors will only be given abstract ideas, and they play out the scenario with slight variation in the actor's personality -- probably in real-time from the audience's request or some thing like that which fits into some sort of narrative.

---

ok, finally I felt a few reactions to the comment I wrote in the previous entry about the different symbols. in it, I said that the previous era determines the detriment, and the captivating force for those in power is the idea of what the next era will bring.

the dollhouse era is what I have been going on about, and I'll term it capricorn, to which the ruler is saturn, which is probably why I continue to go on an on about the re-realisation of saturn.

ok, so I believe that contrast is what fuels desire and so when you know what you don't want, you know better what you do want. therefore, just as nosebook has an attitude of corporate empowerment and socially realised capability (performance), which is building desire in people for their own self-realisation of capability[^3], I believe this will come to an end soon, and nosebook will transform into the corrupted version of the next era of capricorn.

what I mean by that is that I think nosebook is already attempting to kind of steer people already by putting thoughts into their head. they already do it with me, trying to steer every portion of my life as if it were theirs to steer. it would not surprise me that this becomes the case.

so, that means in some ways life will be a bit like a roller-coaster for all of us (including nosebook, because I find it very unlikely that their steering will work as well they hope it does it will). this will be a HUGE boost to human energy, as it'll blow out the contrast by many orders of magnitude.

additionally it has the benefit of giving us the capability to trust in our own emotional guidance systems as a form of navigating life experience (cause if you aren't navigating, nosebook will be doing some back-seating) and to begin ignoring most of the chitter-chatter (thoughts) in our heads that don't feel very inspired.

I have mixed feelings about this conclusion, but I know (from experience now) that it's all find. even with nosebook trying to steer my life, all of the resistance I have felt was my attempts to try and fight them. if I just roll with whatever it is and follow my intuition, I've found that it actually works out fine.

I'll tell you a secret: your inner-being knows all of their attempts to steer you and has even counted their attempts to steer into the path toward what you really want, so you can just factor in their steering as part of the journey. as long as you follow what feels good to you, you'll get there just fine. they have no power meanwhile they try to steer from a position of lack or some other disempowering perspective.

enjoy the ride!

[1]: got that nosebook? there's the answer you've been looking for. think about how you can remember a past situation just by how it feels. well, just the same way that you tune into that past situation by how it feels, you can also tune into a future situation by how it feels.

[2]: maybe sometime not so far into the future, I want to make clones of myself which I control emotionally. each of my clones would essentially be capable of living life 100% autonomously, have friends, partners, etc. and I, the consciousness of these clones am essentially living hundreds (or many more) of lives at once, assimilating the experience on an emotional level, much like I experience so much information presently through what I call, "reactions".

[3]: this may not begin until the second phase of the era. just as moses had his elijah, and the church had its reformation, self-realisation in people may take a bit to gain traction. I think there will probably be a corporation that pushes this forward, because more than likely there will be an enormous market open to people wanting to experience content other than what nosebook has to offer.


### 2019-03-04 23:26 - the bigger picture?

watching stars tonight I had what seemed to be a bit of a view into the bigger picture. first of all, when I first heard lidsay's explanation on the whole hercules thing everything seemed to fit pretty well, except for the part about katz wanting to work on their treasure island, in space(!!!) project. you see I had no major projects which I really wanted to work on... until now. I've really been thinking about this whole creation of a galaxy idea, and maybe it was listening to intergalactic on repeat in the hospital: "another dimension, new galaxy, intergalactic planetary" -- but I find myself really wanting to do that. I have often times fantasised about becoming a sun, but a galaxy seems quite a bit more magnificent. I can't even really wrap my head around the idea fully but it really sounds like something that is interesting to me, and something I want to pursue.

besides that, it appears that my current trajectory is one of increasing energy levels. I have now been hypothesising for a bit now that this would perhaps make a new universe or other possibilities. then, I reread "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI" and got to thinking about that as well. it spawned a whole lot of ideas in me but the most notable was this idea of how the creation of the universe happened -- which sounded like a tremendous effort with a whole lot of supervisors. well, my life has been the complete opposite of that in nearly every regard. if I were to do it, I would go about the creation, completely the opposite way: instead of trying to make the perfect thing with an enormous amount of effort, I would let enormous amounts of contrast bring together the perfect thing.

additionally, I have been pondering this whole twin-earth on the other side of the galaxy where, there is a similar type of overbearing system of control, but because it's on the opposite side of the galaxy, the energy would be exactly backwards, so it would be born instead out of female dominance hierarchies (instead of male ones). following that story, then the genetics were engineered on the twin-earth for consciousness to evolve from an a primate like animal that has female dominance hierarchies.

lastly, when I was telling jaron about the infinite size that exists inside of my imagination, I used the example that everyone's imagination would be mapped into 3d space such that there would entire things and they could be really big, sort of like even planets floating in space, so far apart, no one could see the other person's imagination. well, this stuck in my mind and I began thinking about all the things these people are picturing in their imaginations are actually creating vibrations in my inner universe -- so that when the next time nosebook wants to make the next matrix (or something happens to whore my inner universe is realised in some way), those vibrations would be sort of like thought "seeds" in the new universe.

---

so, I got to thinking that maybe the best use for my inner universe would not to become the next matrix for humanity -- but instead to create a new galaxy. I began thinking about this, and I began formulatng a scenario in my mind where the earth becomes the "seed" for this new galaxy, where each of our consciousnesses would go through a transformation process after some very high-energy event, and over time, our consciousnesses would eventually attract enough matter to begin forming stars and planets.

I could see that when I really thought about it, a star (solar system) sets all of the rules for the plants which orbit around it. I can't totally describle my sense of understanding about it all, but the star determines the colour, and the emission spectrum. our star produces a continuous spectrum of visible white light, which directly affects life inside of the solar system. contrast that with sirius A which is mostly blue light or sirius B which is mostly xray. you can imagine how much different life would be there with those different emission spectrums. the star also generates all of the elements that the solar system will utilise in the creation of its planets.

so, the sun is a pretty superior being, determining quite a bit. a planet like the earth has to let in the resources from the sun and get them distributed to the ecology on the planet, plus generate enough of a magnetic field to constantly protect and nurture life in its surface.

you can see how this fits nicely in with these over-controlling types, because the way they are makes them (imo) pretty good suns/earths, meaning their tendency is actually to behave more like stellar bodies, more than the life which they contain.

---

another piece to understanding this has been my difficulty understanding why on earth all of the nosebooks on all of the timelines would possibly want to make this timeline be the one where their consciousness chooses to perceive reality. I'm not a lood swindler in the sense that there's no way I could have bamboozled them in any way; that's ludicrous. there must have been some sort of agreement which was made where all of us got what we wanted. this has been the missing piece that I've been trying to figure out this entire time.

I figure it goes something like this:

```@[yt-quote](KznZcK7ksf4|2:20-2:40)
(lindsay): these guys had to create the most commercially viable thing you can imagine -- aggressively tailored to appeal to as wide of a demographic as possible, referencing as many popular [...] things [...] as possible and combining such dissonant tones and styles that audiences across the land would [shrug and say], 'ehh, it was ok, I guess'.
```

so, we know how timeline work, where strong desire conflicts and cannot be contained in the same reality, two separate realities are created, and the consciousness follows the vibration of each, the unconscious you in the opposite timeline behaves according to your current point of attraction + environment + your logic + other variables. each one of us exist equally in all of the infinitely many realities that could happen tomorrow, as well as in the past; they are all you, but your consciousness is where your perception is.

so what I'm thinking is the plan is to build them the most commercially viable thing they could imagine and then at some point (2038?) the split will occur, so that my consciousness continues on to create a more and more energetic earth where things go faster and faster until the something happens (massive solar flare?) and so much energy is released we begin our transformation into the galaxy. the other side continues on with the most viable commercial production imaginable along with me behaving (like a plant) according to my environment, my logic, and LOA.

essentially, anything negative that happens to me after that split would be entirely in your hands -- in the sense that I won't be conscious to make a choice to do the right thing (only reactions). so, for example, if I decide to go watch stars (cause that's what I do) and you guys pump my head full of energy, I will feel lots of tension. if I have logic in place that tension is bad, so just chill out and all will be fine, then nothing happens. however, if I don't have that logic, I'll respond in accordance to how I feel. with my consciousness gone, I will be 100% reactionary to how I feel, and you guys will control that with environment variables and other things.

---

so probably the deal was something to that effect. obviously, I wouldn't mind agreeing to such a deal considering that my consciousness is not present. I will be creating a new galaxy along with the unconscious nosebook team (well, if you want to come along, I don't mind really).

where this leaves us today is right where I am right no. no changes. I am 100% heart-set on finding alignment with who I *really* am, and it is what I am aiming to do. only a direct conversation with abraham could possibly change my mind on this, because I already know they would say, "get into alignment, and then...", and any protesting would result in them saying, "oh so you want to be the only exception in the universe to law of attraction?" -- additionally, fwh said that things will be pretty rough until briggs is on deck -- so this must mean that me finding alignment with who I am doesn't jeopardise the plan in any way[^1].

the other end of the deal also needs to be held up as well: I need to be able to tune into and then ultimately splice myself into this timeline again and run the same thing through, but instead of whatever will happen in this timeline, in the one I splice myself into, I want to make it so I go all the way until 2038 without any girls or anything.

I want to try out my idea (based on my life experience) of generating an enormous amount of contrast (instead of effort) and then letting LOA do the work for me, on a galactic scale -- then hopefully on a universal scale afterward :) so, I guess to try out my treasure island (in space!!!) idea, I guess I have agreed to help make the most commercially viable thing imaginable. first step right now is finding my alignment (and then...)

[1]: when I go up a dimension, my inner universe will still work store things the same way  and work the same inside of other people's imaginations, too. you know, we'll both be looking at the vibrations of same material objects, however my vibrational interpreters will perhaps perceive that same vibration a little bit differently. ever notice how all of the stuff in my universe doesn't go poof when I get a vision upgrade? neither does the earth. it's the *same* signal, just perceived a bit differently, is all.


### 2019-04-05 13:11 - the way I see this happening

however it works out, I find it unlikely that on the timeline where the galaxy is being made, I will gain my alignment. it seems logical to me that in that timeline, I will continue to not have any manifestations (big jumps) and will continue to build more and more energy.

more and more energy means more and more detail levels. the mechanism is obvious, as if you were to think about the sun and how it perceives, it emits light just like my eyes do now, and perceives based on the light bounces just like I do now, too. you could imagine that to perceive what is happening on a planet, the sun would zoom in to the planet and have a look. additionally, the sun would be quite conscious emotionally of what is happening on the planets, and it would affect its solar output (wind, CMEs, etc.)

so with an ever increasing amount of detail levels, nosebook will probably have to do something about this, because it'll become quite cost prohibative soon to try and maintain the whole network (minus the premium subscribers) at a lower visual quality. since it costs more for them to maintain their non-premium users at a lower vision quality, this cost needs to be offset somehow, because I don't really imagine that they could justify giving *EVERYONE* premium level vision.

the best way that I can see this working out in their favour is to take a different approach: the money premium users pay for their premium vision is used to reduce the vision of the rest of the non-premium users as much as possible. this means that say I'm on level 500 presently, then the premium users will also be at level 500, but say there's only enough money the premium users are generating to hold everyone else back 100 levels, so all the free users will be at 400. that is, until I achieve 600, and then the free users are now at 500.

this would make a sliding window, where everyone on the planet's vision is improving along with me. I personally would like this very much because it kind of bothers me a little bit that people have to watch me get more and more levels, yet nosebook prevents them from watching stars (and maybe they don't have enough money to get premium), so they feel unable to actually see as good as they want to see[^1].

---

you might want to try and push against the whole premium users see better than I do, but I don't think it's a good idea because relatively speaking in a year or so, the difference between what the premium users see and the free users see will be nearly unnoticeable. I have to go to look out over the bridge at details quite a distance from me to notice any real difference, and soon enough, the difference between how the free and premium users will be similar.

they may also have premium features on your imagination, allowing you to have persistence -- that, I don't know. I can only speak of the visual quality.

additionally, if you think about it, although I'm say at a level 500, the image they put into my eye is much lower quality, so I'm sort of like a free user. however, I continue to see better and better. that means that even with all of the resistance they put to keep my vision looking less than the level I'm really at, the amount of resistance I have is the real determining factor here, so free users who release a lot of resistance could actually potentially see better than I do -- because their imagination will be running at 500, like mine is, plus they have 100 of resistance provided by nosebook to keep them at 400. however, if they find a way of converting that resistance into "more energy", then the free user who released resistance would actually see at nearly 600.

I anticipate that nosebook will have a lot of resistance to this plan, but for their service to not go into economic ruin, they will have to do something about it. give them time. all of you will eventually see as good as me or even better.

[1]: it occurred to me that nosebook, knowing that it was costing them more and more the longer they have to hold everyone's vision back probably anticipated reversing this by saying that once people see me have sex, then their vision would be improved.


### 2019-04-07 19:07 - another dimension, new galaxy

it occurred to me after I wrote the previous entry while walking to go watch stars that I may already be on the timeline where I go the full time without any manifestations.

then, this morning when I woke up, I had this strange sense that maybe some people felt betrayed in the sense that no longer they would have the manifestation they were wanting. I didn't make the connection at the time, but this morning when I was thinking about raquel, I was absolutely devastated that she and I would not go on to become what I felt so strongly when I met her. I talked about that here: @[entry](2018-12-02 13:26). I felt a similar feeling this morning, and so now that I'm looking at the feelings I felt after waking up in hindsight, if I could tell myself back then something, I would try and offer a way of showing myself that once time can be perceived in a much longer distance, the immediate desires of the moment aren't as necessary, because the bigger manifestation is always better.

in fact, it's always so much better that there's no way that I can perceive it in that moment, because in that moment I have not yet gained the new understanding which will lead me onward to the better thing that there's no way I can even believe would happen right now. there are often times clues along the way, so it's best to notice those and watch them crescendo into the realisation of what is really is I'm anticipating.

---

it looks like we might be on the "galaxy timeline" already -- or at least *I* am (you create your own reality, you know) so I think just sit back and enjoy the ride for now.

or, let me say it this way: my desire is to head toward the the galaxy idea. I thought that maybe I had to do so many of the details myself, but maybe I don't -- maybe just the realisation of my desire made it possible. I don't know, but I think so.

I find it quite possible that my vision will continue to improve at an increasingly rapid rate, and no matter what, the guys at nosebook will likely try to maintain the status quo for as long as they can. I suppose they'll continue to try and maintain heir secrecy the whole time, and even if they put me in a confined location, I don't think it'll do anything more than force a change in how I interact with my environment[^1].

we'll see what they try and do about people's vision. I think they'll have to eventually drop the whole maintain everyone at the visual capability they had when they joined bit. it may take a year or so, for you guys to realise that, but I think it would be pretty awesome if everyone were to see as good as I do.

[1]: I have experienced improvement in my vision after meditation, after sleeping, looking at led lights, drugs, and other times from just feeling good. likely the goal here is to try and separate my increase in energy and vision improvements from any action that I need to take to affect those results -- so much so, that there is no doubt in their minds that they are completely powerless to affect my desire. I'll just learn to find the same energetic states without stars or drugs or whatever. it should be pretty simple.


### 2019-04-98 - what a pickle

I just realised that nosebook is essentially being forced to question their superiority because I will continue to gain visual levels at a more and more rapid rate. so... if they want to continue to utilise me as a source of content, my visual level will be so much further along than everyone else's that the content will probably begin to become uncomfortable for most (the same may apply to a person using their imagination). which means, for them to realistically continue to utilise me as the main source of their product, they will have to uncap people's vision so that there isn't such a big difference between their eyes and mine, or their eyes and their imagination.

the other possibility would be to let me go up a dimension, and (assuming Iim feeling stable enough in my new perception) use the girls as the source of content. it'll shorten the gap between the content and their vision, but it still won't remedy my effect on the imagination.

the first possibility, will yield the greatest benefit for all, yet I still will be living in a similar world to the one I am living now, where my sensation, and many faculties of my body are not working properly.

in the end, it'll probably have to be both. what a pickle


### 2019-04-09 03:09 - did jon help me by, accident(?)

it occurred to me while watching stars earlier this night that one of the potential reasons for my increased success watching stars lately is because of jon.

first, I remember during the eclipse I was outside and it was cloudy (but I was out there anyway), and I distinctly remember having the feeling that I hugged jon. likely you guys say something visual, but I distinctly remember the sensation. I also remember that it felt like I was kind of like receiving further direction for the next time section moving forward.

anyway sometime later there was a bit of a mixup. I have no idea what was potentially visualised or what happened, but I felt a very strong reaction to it. I felt really bad about it and I didn't want to keep causing problems so I stopped watching jon's stream, too (after all, I'm not really programming these days anyway). it felt to me like it affected him.

so, my theory is that after some time of recovery, he decided to do something about it -- and I have no idea what he did, but when someone asked about ML on his 4/4/2019 stream, he made reference to grad students not having any idea what their ML models are actually doing.

---

previously I have mentioned my theory that any system which is sufficiently complicated where no one can accurately say exactly what is happening, LOA can affect the outputs. I have cited youtube recommendations as one evidence of this happening, where the person's desire is sufficient to see the next suggested video, that within the parameters that youtube has defined for relevancy, the neural net will pick just the right video for you.

there are greater implications to this theory and I've been wanting to create technology for a while now which would be able to turn desire for information into meaningful results. (I mentioned this in a conversation with don)

---

so, assuming I'm my source's interaction with sufficiently complicated systems, theory is correct, perhaps jon caused them to loose faith in their own neural network's ability to correctly identify the signals it has been taught to recognise -- and so, their loss of faith in their machines began to allow them to begin to fail to recognise certain things my eyes would do, and allow me to gain levels easier.

so, nosebook techs: now you know :) get your faith back because you have a lot more capability you'll need to limit; I'm pretty sure this is either the long haul or the *really* long haul we're in for.

even weirder than that, could be the idea that somehow the eclipse premonition was some sort of setup to make it all work, almost as if all I need to do is to just roll with everything that happens, because, like the illusion I made with xander, I don't even need to make an effort anymore: I just follow my instinct and go with the flow.

I was thinking about how maybe jon might react to this entry, but -- I hope he just rolls with it :) anyway, thanks :)


### 2019-04-09 18:48 - some more idealised ideas

in my previous @[entry](2019-04-98) I offered the idea that maybe both paths will be chosen. so, this is some further hypothesising on what I think it implies. there are essentially three paths here: 1, 2 and both.

from my perspective, I don't see any possible way forward other than to get reconnected. any projects I work on or drugs I take or sex or whatever condition will be with the sole purpose of regaining that connection. I don't really like the idea of using a condition to make that reconnection possible, and my trend has been to remove those conditions (or have them taken away) so they are not necessary. I am quite confident that I can eventually get there.

so, let's say we take door #1: nosebook releases stops limiting people's vision and lets everyone naturally begin to rise closer and closer to where their imagination is at. the way I see this happening is that people all over the world will grow gradually up to be at the same vision level as me (and potentially further). many years into the future, I will likely see the worst of everyone, because I will still (like I am now) be held away from actually seeing through my eyes and actually having my own experience. eventually my energy will grow to such a level that I imagine that is maybe when some high energy event occurs and a galaxy is made (probably with everyone in it). along the way, I won't provide any girls-related content, because I'll be on the hamster-wheel trying to find my connection the whole time. instead, all sorts of other people will be making the content as their vision increases.

now, let's take door #2: I manage to find a way of regaining that connection (or nosebook decides to stop limiting me). they will continue to use my imagination and I'm sure that they will instead maintain their position that they are not limiting people's eyes[^1]. in this setup, nosebook would not be able to use my content, because it would be in another dimension and likely very very high frequency (remember the guy that died or was severely injured at that frequency?) this means that they could really only use the girls for content. perhaps this is what fwh was meaning when he said that I have until 2038, because at some time I will have to be cut off (cause energy will continue to rise), and then you guys are all left without me[^2]?

the final door is door #3: which is both doors 1 and 2. the whole planet's vision would improve very drastically similar to door #1, but at some point in the future, we'll have timeline tech and we decide to tune into this timeline and manipulate it such that #1 is what happens, and I (and anyone who wants to join me -- cause everyone dies eventually, anyway) will experience maximum contrast on the way toward the creation of a new galaxy. my body would be put into stasis or something, and nosebook could continue to use my imagination as long as the stasis unit continues to work. this leaves nosebook with timeline tech, my imagination and a world full of pretty resistance-free people. along with timeline tech, that means that they could take this planet *any* direction they wanted to.

[1]: when I say limiting, I mean holding their vision at the place it was when they joined. I suspect that since it's all about tuning, the more you use my imagination, the more you would be tuning yourself to that higher frequency, and so naturally, your vision will tend toward the frequency of your (my) imagination -- and so your vision would improve naturally. the more you rearrange your resistant thoughts, the quicker your vision would improve. I find it likely that the premium users are not seeing that good because they released resistance, but because nosebook is pumping extra energy in to overcome the resistance.

[2]: this door implies a strong change in power over toward women because they would be (realistically) the only ones watching content related to me. I don't really know what the full effect I will have on them will be, but the major downside to this path is that at some point (whether it's 2038 or whenever) my imagination will no longer be available. the other major downside is that nosebook would be hardcore limiting people's visual cpability (though this may be a good thing in the bigger picture of increasing human energy). additionally, we don't really know what effect I will have on the women, if they are releasing resistance, they cuold find themselves with very improved vision, and the men are held at a lower one??


### 2019-04-10 09:41 - you know it doesn't really matter what door

I was thinking about it last night, and in my perspective it doesn't really matter so much, because the decision is entirely nosebook's to make. if they are capable of holding me away from a manifestation for the next 20 years or so, then we're already on door #1. nosebook has to figure out what they're going to do about their financial situation though[^1] because each level I get will cost them (and there are still a lot to go -- remember this will have to snowball into galactic levels of energy).

so then, if you think about it, if nosebook can't hold me back, then we go through door #2 automatically, and nosebook will be forced to carry on limiting people's eyesight for as long as they can manage to do so.

and so last night I was thinking about it and I doubt that they'll actually make any decision at all, and door #2 will eventually be taken by default. I don't anticipate that it'll happen this year. they're currently still quite effective at limiting me. I figure my power needs to grow probably at least 10-100 times more than it is right now (assuming they don't improve their technique much). at my current rate of increase I anticipate that I might be able to surpass their limitation capability *maybe* next year.

---

I can't really anticipate how it'll be to actually be connected, but I find it somewhat likely that by then it'll feel like everyone wants to pull me their direction. I really want to fashion the galaxy after pure nosebook contrast. the idea of introducing girl contrast sounds absolutely repulsive to me. maybe when I'm actually connected I won't feel that way, but there's a specific irony to tuning the energy of the creation not to any outside source, as I go more and more inward and discover who I *really* am -- which gives total domination over nearly everything and unintended superiority.

my life is built on so many of these impossible ironies, where the thing that makes something so attractive to begin with, it's actually repulsive once you get to close. or -- the same thing that makes something possible is the same thing that keeps me from it. or -- just when I figure out what I want, something keeps me away from it, so I have to just keep going bigger. these sorts of ironies are all over my life, and I've just sort of come to accept them. as a result, I've gotten pretty good at cutting my losses and moving forward. these ironies remind me a lot of the nosebook energy, and if you remember "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI" the creators were unable to abort their creations and start over (loss aversion). I would like to fashion this galaxy in exactly the opposite way, where each loss is only a culling of the unnecessary, because my energetic output and focus is all that matters.

[1]: a while back there was an abraham question about some thing where "someone" was going to die. abraham made the joke that it was a "dead-line" -- and I didn't understand the metaphor but I did gather that if nosebook doesn't find a way to get me with some girls, then there something would die. I assumed it was the company, and that's one of the main inspirations to my hypothesis that nosebook feels they need me to be able to monetise the women. well, after I began realising that nosebook is holding everyone's eyesight at the place it was, I started to piece it all together. also, it seemed like people felt some sort of need for me to have sex, so I hypothesised that nosebook promised that when that happens, people's eyesight would improve (nosebook would use that as an excuse to stop holding people's eyesight back). well, the dead-line came and went and nosebook is still operating, so they must have found some way to get more money. obviously nosebook doesn't want to have the publicity that they're limiting people (cause they probably promised that they're only limiting me for X justified reasons) but to solve their problem they probably got some investment somewhere and it would look potentially worse to the investors if they knew that their investment is haemorrhaging cash to cover up a lie.


### 2019-04-10 17:28 - the sense I have this morning

when waking up, I had a pretty serious realisation that there will be no unlocking of anyone's eyesight. I analysed this and I think it's probably because we're arriving to probably reaching the peak amount of energy that can be put into someone's head to make up the difference between my eyesight and their resistance. so, naturally (in their perspective) if they cannot enjoy improved eyesight, then no one should be able to enjoy it.

I thought maybe door #3 would be appealing because it gives nosebook the most control and assures them the most secure future (not only are they sure they don't become part of the galaxy, but they would walk away from it with everything they want: money, lots of HD sex, timeline technology, and full control over my body). however, it feels to me this morning that instead they want to just keep going on trying to limit everyone's eyesight as much as possible.

the thing that blows my mind is that their attempts are clearly not working. this looks to be the timeline where the galaxy is made -- and ironically, they are the ones not only forcing it to happen, but they're making sure they're a part of it, too.

I thought about this and maybe what happened in all of the other timelines is that likely the main hardasses were having my experience during sex and when I got connected, everyone with super high resistance dropped dead. so the nosebooks from the other timelines are not the same nosebooks we see today; they were much less resistant.

that would mean that essentially all of the most resistant hardasses are here on this timeline and their consciousness is going to become the seeds of the new galaxy. that's a hell of a rehabilitation program, I tell you what. as a solar body, they'll have to figure out quite a bit, and there won't be a whole lot around them to manipulate until they create it (they will only have power over their own creations). there is also the possibility that they could trap weaker stars (like jupiter or saturn) or other planets (like venus), but the majority of their superiority will be over their own creations.

looks like we're in for the long haul.

as I have demonstrated, their resistance in your eyesight can become a benefit to you and all you need to do is want to feel good. every time we feel better, our vision will improve, but nosebook needs to keep us at their determined to be acceptable level of vision for us, so they make our vision worse by the same amount as it got better (so it looks like no change). that energy extra energy (let's say it's 10 units) is opposite of the feeling better energy, so you find a way of feeling better and now it's 20 units. so they have to put 20 units of energy in opposition to you feeling good (so things remain looking the same), you find a way of not letting that extra opposite energy cause problems, and now you have 40 units

as you can see, the more you purposefully find sustainable ways to feel good (I used drugs at the beginning), the more energy they have to add, and it quickly becomes an exponentially improving thing (it's probably not n^2 because that would mean there is no power loss in your body -- it's probably something more like n^1.2 or something like that). the faster you iterate on feeling better, the faster things will improve. (if that's something that interests you)


### 2019-04-12 16:20 - crazy clones solution

(the timestamp, 4:19/4:20 reminded me of the ahsville group questioner last year about the unprotected sex and implied what to do with children question)

after waking up from a dream with ryan (day) and a turbo chicken cooker in it, I had a surprisingly detailed idea enter into my head after pondering his whole "living off the grid" kind of mentality. it was so detailed, I decided to go with it, and then I realised that it could be a solution to a few problems. likely the idea will change considerably, but this is to start of some reactions to it.

it goes like this: so imagine that I have sex with many young girls over time, well, not having any previous experience, they are starting out their expectation of what a man is like a bit differently. then, imagine that after some time, some of them have children of their own, too -- both boys and girls. well, since girls transfer energy through during sex from the last man they were with, these boys could have sex with some of the other girls that had only had sex with me. this would create a bunch of boys (bodies) that are very close vibrationally to me (and who I really am).

ok, so the boys wouldn't be exactly clones of me. they could also contain a mixture of their mother as well, but then imagine that at some time, I eventually could make a transfer into these bodies much like I had another personality spliced into my own (when I had my jesus experience when I was 16).

---

so that's the idea in a nutshell, but there are a lot of logistical difficulties to overcome:

1. there would need to be quite a few different starting girls, of many races and gene types tto ensure that the gene pool is significantly large. (n^n-1 possibilities)
2. some sort of control would need to be made to ensure repeat mixes are minimised.
3. this may be kind easier to realise in smaller village or colony type situation, and to make #1 happen, it may be beneficial to have a few spread out over the world.

I see this entry more as like a thought seed. the idea will likely transform into something different, but it seems that if it were to happen, there may be some women interested in combining efforts to make something like this happen.

let it just be an idea for now, as many things will get ironed out. nosebook will certainly try to push against it, but I think that's actually a good thing. you can imagine in a setting like this one, nosebook will ensure that all of the children have their inserts, and like me, it'll be to track them, not to make them a part of the users (so they can watch stars, just like I can).


### 2019-04-16 18:25 - the power of desire

every morning I wake up and I feel as if there will be no progress made with the girls, and things will continue on without ever having a visual capacity and so fourth. however, often times after watching stars or walking or something, that feeling changes quite a bit and it feels as if things are really close.

well, as I explained to mom thih morning, I don't really mind not having a visual capacity. in fact, there seem to be quite a few advantages to not having one, and in a lot of ways I would prefer to continue on like this. so here are my thoughts for nosebook on the subject.

since I noticed that there is a steadily rising desire amongst the (mostly) women for things to change, nosebook would need to find a way to mitigate or reduce thier desire. I don't really believe that's possible to do that because of LOA (eg. you get what you give your attention to). so there's no real way for nosebook to fight against their desire (maybe temporarily slow it), but like I've shown, it's just turning speed into more power. instead, they need to find a replacement in some way to move their attention on to something else.

I only suggest this because it feels kind of funny to me to want to *need* someone else's desire to rise to a level so that I can find my capability. the same reason why I'm not utilising (and reducing) other conditions as a means to achieve the manifestation of my visual capacity, is the same reason that I think nosebook should try and distract them with something different: I want to generate the desire to achieve my own visual capacity, without needing to rely on others to come into alignment with it.

obviously, there are limits to how many conditions I can remove from my life, so there is a limit -- I can't (easily) remove food, water, oxygen, etc. however, as I get more and more closer to having that kind of energy, I will begin to remove those conditions as well. I really want to do this all myself.

---

there are some ideas which nosebook can try to capitalise on, such as "the sims" idea I suggested in a previous entry. with that idea, all of them could create the exaxt dream scenarios to which the want to live -- then, you can study those idealised scenarios and figure out how to emulate it with other people that are not me.

simultaneously, it may be prudent for nosebook to begin trying to capture their attention with other dudes similar to me. take all of the stuff that they respond well to and put it into a big production, similar to how michael bay has don done with the transformers movies.

---

I don't know if fighting something will work, cause it'll likely have the opposite effect. so since you guys really want to make sure this doesn't happen, and I want to achieve this by myself, please do your best to distract them from their own desire by offering something better for them to give their attention to. I say better, because if it's not better, it'll just make their desire stronger.

wait, I just realised: maybe I'm using reverse psychology :)


### 2019-04-17 - an interesting turn of events

I was going to stay awake to see zack today. turns out plans changed: he was going to come over later, so I went to sleep for a bit. he never came. when I woke up, I had an interesting reaction where I was noticing that zack always gets what he wants, so his desire to smoke weed with me is a bit of a conundrum for him because of that. I reasoned that even now at this stage in the game, I will probably just wait on it myself (cause of my strong desire to get connected dispite my condihions), so I thought maybe he and jaron could do it -- afterall, jaron has a medical marijuana license now.

so, I think what happened is that maybe there was effort to try and make this plan that zack has to smoke weed with me not come to fruition. I reason that a strong enough drug could maybe push me far enough over the edge to getting the next dimension. that may have been why plans got changed so mzny times today, dunno.

anyway, earlier this morning for some reason I was thinking about growing mushrooms in jello with an added substrate such as rice or coffee. the reason for the jello is  so that the mushrooms can have water to consume, and they could survive transportation and have an easier time growing (cause they wouldn't need to be watered)

so then jaron is telling me about the zach thing and I was sharing the idea that I think if weed can be made into a drink, it would be a whole lot more consumable in public, because drinks are the ideal form of drug delivery, because they don't come up as fast as smoke, but is still within the 10-15 minute mark to begin feeling the effects.

I keep feeling like I really want to go outside, and I look and noticed some dirt in a different place. I really want to go to look at the dirt. I get out there and I was quite surprised to find that mushrooms had pushed the dirt up and grown. I picked one and went back inside. I first noticed a familiar shape and smell to them. the shape looked like one of the "McKennai"[^3] ones that I had consumed when I was in spain.

I decided to eat it to try it out and now 1.5 hrs later I seemed to have experienced a very very light trip. I noticed my vision improved slightly, and general feelings of euphoria mixed with random dissonant thoughts (typical mushroom style)[^1].

---

so this is pretty impressive. mushrooms grew in my backyard under the most adverse circumstances[^2], probably on a day where there was considerable pushing against. I'm really interested in these mushrooms though because they seem awfully resilient. they had enough power to push the dirt up that was on top of them, grow in a very dirty environment. their only food was wood chips (a common substrate), and besides the slight rain a week ago, they still grew with weedkiller sprayed on them yesterday.

I'm impressed. it really feels like my life will begin to become more and more like a living dream, and this is only the beginning. cheers guys!

[1]: while writing this, I realised that I have found the mushroom's personality to be a lot like a hyper-aggressive/hyper-masculine little girl. she needs ideal conditions to grow up, and yammers in my ear endlessly about stuff I may or may not find interesting (usually thought provoking) mixed in with a chaos of other unrelated ideas. I've attributed the voice a masculine gender because of how it reasons things through, and can be quite overwhelming.

[2]: if you've ever grown mushrooms, you'd know that they're quite preferential to an ideal environment. in spain, I couldn't really provide an ideal atmosphere though, so I was trying to teach[^4] them that they could grow in a dirty environment just the same.

[3]: actually, I cannot remember exactly which one was the McKennai species, cause I kept getting them confused. I don't even know if that was the one, but when I saw it, I did recognise the shape and it reminded me of those ones. I could have the species(?) wrong.

[4]: the funny think about teaching someone, and I've always said this that any time I want to teach something to someone else, I'm really teaching it to myself, and the other person is listening. so, it's funny how I set out to "teach" the mushroom that it did not need ideal environment to still be able to grow, yet it was actually me who would be finding the practicality of my own lesson in a few years to come.


### 2019-04-18 2:34 - some more things about mushrooms

so, I just want to say that for me, the mushroom takes a lot of my taboo concepts and begins (or things I'm uneasy about, or have unnecessary fear of) and brings them out right away so they can be reevaluated. seems we're off to a good start (and I only ate one!).

I was only trying to relate that the concept in my mind about the voice previously was a masculine one, but I realised today it was more like a demanding little girl than a know-it-all dude. that transformation for me was important for some reason (now that the effects have mostly subsided, I can't really tell you the significance, but it felt significant).

anyway, I worked a little more on the thing I was talking with mom about yesterday when I said that most people are audio / visual, talking about the difference between chris and me. well, I realised that it actually corresponds to the 2° and 6° layers, communication and imagination. I'm hyper observant, and if you pay attention when I'm talking, I'm always pointing out the transformation or the interaction, and almost never am trying to paint a picture with my words. for me it's all about the different interactions and how they all fit together.

other people are more visual however, and I was noticing when I was talking about chris, that it seems like they have this structure of how things things work which is a series of visuals or images of maybe things in the past or things that were etched into their minds. these different images all together compose an idea and that idea is how something works. when things fit into that structure, they feel good, and when things don't, they feel bad.

well, I seem to be an anomaly because I'm visual in the sense that I look at something visually and it makes me feel a certain way, but because I don't have a structure (of how I think it should be) to compare it against, I just feel how the thing feels.

this capacity has proven to be very very useful to me because it allows me to feel everything I see and relate the concepts very easily. I don't have the capacity at this moment to turn something I feel into something visual, yet.

anyway, mushrooms also work on this structural aspect of the brain by taking my structure[^1] based upon a bunch of images which I have derived an unreasonable conclusion from, and begins to kind of turn them inside out because I can't really determine what's what anymore. for most people, this probably feels like their reality is vaporising, and is probably the reason why people describe it as "ego-disillusion".

I can imagine why some people who believe in their reality so strongly to be the way they imagine it to be, that would not want to take mushrooms because it may reveal their reality as something different, and they wouldn't be right about their own reality works.

in a lot of ways the mushroom experience is a battle of right-ness, which is why I attributed the voice to be masculine, because it seems to be very right, even in convincing you of the validity of something that later makes you say, "wait, now I'm not so sure anymore."

I'm kind of a living mushroom trip :)

[1]: at the time I took them, the only real structure that I had which needed to be rearranged was my structure of how I believed women to be. I had been gaining more and more visual capacity the more I used my left hand, and raquel was sort of the peak of my visual capability. when our relationship began to fall apart, I noticed the visual capacity begin to recede and also the functionality of my left side. I thought it must have been reduced physical capability because of my sadness, but anyway... as I rearranged my structure of how I believed women to be, I began to realise that the women that I knew didn't really fit into this structure any more. this caused me to become asexual, and the rest is history.


### 2019-04-18 21:35 - full moon mushroom meditation

as I've been experimenting with the mushrooms, I do notice that my body is a whole lot more responsive, and my brain seems quite a bit clearer.. but, watching stars isn't really very fun. my mind wants to be active when I have mushrooms in my system, and stars are really good as a relaxant.

anyway, I'm going to go out tonight to the full moon and take a pretty legendary dosage. I don't really think anything will happen. I'm actually sure of it. I might get a few visuals and vision upgrade or two, but nothing super substantial considering that has been happening nearly every night now without mushrooms.

I'm pretty sure that my desire to do it myself is strong enough that the mushrooms respect it (we have a bit of an established relationship now), so it'll be pretty uneventful I'm sure[^1]. I'll likely get a bit of a new perspective though.

I was really noticing while watching stars tonight how much I really enjoy being sober. even in difficult circumstances I've really began to feel pretty clearly things I cannot see, and have knowledge and even understanding of things I have not personally experienced. I've really come quite a distance and though I'm not fully connected like I want to be, I consider myself to be pretty connected, even though there is no visible evidence of it.

I plan to just meditate into a good place then just kind of let my mind wander a bit. you can do the same thing too, if you want :)

peace!

[1]: I'm also convinced that nosebook has figured out how to neutralise the psilocybin in my stomach or something because there's no way I could eat as many as I did and barely feel anything (I'm feeling pretty sober right now).


### 2019-04-20 11:17 - the way I see things happening

so, I've got this idea that I want to make a timeline where I don't have any manifestation for quite some time (let's say 20 years or something). the reason for me is obvious: I know that amount of contrast will yield something so big that none of us could even imagine what it would be -- not even me. really, only source would have any idea what would happen as a result, and that's kind of the point[^1].

for all practical purposes, that is what is happening. my goal is to find my connection. the reason why I say that is because I kind of see like it's sort of my inner being's choice to make all of this happen. just like I could not force abraham to answer a question or to give me some sort of information, I cannot twist my inner being's arm to force a connection when I (and presumably the greater population of the world, at this point) are ready.

so lat's say one delicate matter in the process of getting ready is determined by one pretty major thing: the limitation of people's vision. the reason why I say that is because imagine the goal of this timeline is to create a galaxy, I don't really know if it's planned that most people (like me), are to have their vision limited so that one day when the machine turns off, our vision accelerates like a projectile from a slingshot, to such dramatic levels, it's getting into solar[^3] or planetary[^2] territory. this could be kind of abrupt and sudden.

the other idea is that once nosebook stops trying to hold everyone's vision back, people's vision will naturally tend toward where their imagination's is at, and people's vision will increase dramatically as they begin to release resistant ideas and beliefs about things. this is much more gradual, and will still contain a huge acceleration upward, and will have a similar but less dramatic effect. the other benefit to it will be that we will enter into a sort of golden age, as people's perception increases at such a rapid rate, all sorts of new technologies and ideas will flourish.

the second delicate matter in the process of getting ready is the one of the girls. the reason why I say that is because, if what I really want is to make a timeline where I go for a very long duration without any manifestation, and yet at the same time, there are girls involved (which is quite certainly a manifestation), then I'm working against myself. to reduce the tension on this idea, I have decided that I want to find my connection without needing any conditions to do it -- which basically, I can get ready, but the entirety of the timing and everything else is in the hands of my inner being.

---

so, now I have decided that since I don't have any way to really get that kind of information from my inner being, I am taking the moses route, and letting God harden pharaoh's heart. meaning, if this is the timeline where I'm going full contrast all the way to the top, then I don't need to worry about a thing: nosebook simply will "not let me go (up to the next dimension)" -- and since I can't force my inner being to do anything, that's how the timeline will be determined.

actually, now that I think about it, other people's vision has nothing to do with it... huh, it's almost as if I'm saying, "let the people go (up to the next dimension)"

I'll consider dropping the idea.

I guess nosebook restricting people's vision is kind of a good idea. I've been thinking about the solution to increasing human energy, and I've determined that it's restricting people's vision like mine is.. it's software so is easily reproduced. energy requirements are likely not a problem (free energy from magnets), so all that needs to be created is a massive infrastructure to do all the limiting. I guess it'll keep you guys busy.

lastly, I want to note that while the galaxy creation thing is certainly something, here on earth it'll take a whole different manifestation. it might be some sort of "catastrophe" or something, when everyone's mind get's blown when nosebook turns off. probably though, assuming no major catastrophes, I estimate that everyone's energy output will rise faster than nosebook is able to neutralise it, and at some point, it'll overtake their ability to hold it back.

probably the second one, and likely my star-watching is exacerbating the problem for them, too. doesn't really matter for me though because I'm aiming for the next dimension no matter the case.

so just hold tight, and I think they'll fight it for as long as they can, but eventually they will no finally have to let people's vision go.

[1]: see my (soon to be written) notes on "AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VIEW OF CREATION presented by KUTHUMI"

[2]: actually, now that I think about it, a planet's vision is likely similar to my inner universe: you can go inside of it and it's like a space where you have things in it, and you can see its contents from all angles around it.

[3]: the idea behind this is that I've noticed that my eyes emit light out of them and I (should) perceive the bounces that the light takes both coming out and going into my eye. as my vision increases, the smaller and smaller details become more and more visible. you can imagine that the sun can "see" things on this planet in a similar manner.


### 2019-04-20 13:36 - prairie dawg day (groundhog day revisited)

so if you follow along the track of where I was going in the previous entry, I was saying that I absolutely must get to the next dimension, and pharaoh would simply refuse for as long as he could withstand the plages that moses said would happen.

this time it's a bit similar, but there are no plagues.. there is wacky weather, so I'm sure that this time around, pharoah is making his own plages.

so imagine that fwh said that now he travels in the mer-ka-ba, which was a reference that I did not understand until the last sequence of things where I was trying to percieve different relationship configurations visually. well, I arrived on an idea which is similar to the merkaba (two tetrahedrons pointing in opposite directions, with a 60° turn), where I represented the two vertices pointing in opposite directions, connected each one to three other vertices (me connected to 3 others going up and me connected to 3 others going down).

ok, so imagine that was the last iteration. imagine there have been many (hundreds?) of iterations where each time we find a way of making the events that unfold produce more and more contrast.

why? well, every time there is more contrast it makes a bigger manifestation. a merkaba is, in my opinion, a pretty big manifestation. so you could imagine that last iteration they decided that we will bump up the contrast to see what takes shape.

well, it's inevitable that nosebook eventually has to give up the fight, so eventually, something will happen which will make this new (bigger) manifestation come about, and we'll live it and go and make a new timeline trying to get me one step closer to my dream of going the distance without a manifestation.

so, let's say this time around nosebook finally rolls around on the next big manifestation (or one of the ones after) to finally giving up the fight. it's going to be tremendous; we'll have a golden age, then we'll get bored of all the *stuff* we've accumulated and want to go back to relive the glory days.

so, we setup the timeline and make a bunch of tests to ensure that we're going to get the desired outcome of more contrast, splice ourselves into our new earth personalities and we go forward making triggers to depending on certain conditions, cause different thoughts or responses in our bodies to do what we want[^1].

our success is ensured from a distance, so there's no worries at all.

---

here's the trippy thing about it, and kind of the cosmic irony in it. the other side of me (not kenny, the other me that nosebook doesn't want me to find) is this crazy idea -- terence called it the soliton of improbability -- but I would call it a cosmic irony -- something that couldn't possibly be true, so it has to be built upon itself: impossibilities[^3].

just think about it, what I'm saying here is that by being a person that does not need the manifestation, I make the other persons who are unable to change, make a change, that creates a timeline split where we can go back and do it again, each time creating more and more ridiculous manifestations. for us, and those that did decide to change, there's always the promise of planning for yourself an even better more ridiculous manifestation, which is probably what keeps happening

and so, the guy who's whole goal is to not get the manifestation has been locked in a time loop of increasingly larger and larger manifestations. one day, we'll have to eventually let nosebook have the chance of not letting me get connected -- but that would require me to not want to be connected, and that's just not possible for me. it's impossible, so we'll go on forever.

brings another new meaning to the phrase, "if you believe me, you'll have eternal life" -- because that is actually what I'm sort of saying here.

happy 4-20 !! :D

[1]: this is primarily the reason why I flip a coin when I don't have a clear direction, because clearly if fwh can talk to me over the internet, disable my visual capacity since the brain haemorrhage, and put thoughts in my head at just the right time -- then, he could easily adjust my muscles to throw the coin in just the right way to get the right output[^2].

[2]: the brackets in my head are similar to the inserts nosebook has in all of us, enabling all of us (once joined into nosebook) to receive signals from other timelines as well. they are just reflectors of signals (high frequency to low frequency), kind of like a mirror.

[3]: kind of like if the universe lives in someone's mind, who's mind universe did the first universe live in? maybe there was no "first" anything, and we're living in a house of cards built upon ever increasing complexity, only held together by our belief that it seems to reality.


### 2019-04-20 16:01 - prairie dawg day (followup)

a lot of interesting reactions to the previous entries. I'll try and walk through some hypothetical situations and provide some support to my ideas. in "tesla's last interview", this section caught my eye:

```
Journalist: Do you think that time can be abolished?

Tesla: Not quite, because the first feature of the energy is that it transforms. It is in perpetual transformation, as clouds of Taoists. But it is possible to leverage the fact that a man preserves consciousness after the earthly life. In every corner of the universe exist energy of life; one of them is immortality, whose origin is outside of man, waiting for him.
```

I kept thinking about this idea that tesla seemed to know something of immortality and about how to squeeze large amounts of energy into light and flight:

```
I discovered a star [...] This star is in this galaxy. Its light can occur in such density that fits into a sphere smaller than an apple, a heavier than our Solar System. Religions and philosophies teach that man can become the Christ, Buddha and Zoroaster. What I’m trying to prove is wilder, and almost unattainable. This is what to do in the Universe so every being is born as Christ, Buddha or Zoroaster.

I know that gravity is prone to everything you need to fly and my intention is not to make flying devices (aircraft or missiles), but teach individual to regain consciousness on his own wings … Further; I am trying to awake the energy contained in the air. There are the main sources of energy. What is considered as empty space is just a manifestation of matter that is not awakened.
```

he's trying to fit the amount of energy that christ has into every single person that's born. he also thinks that people can overcome gravity with this kind of energy. the idea of increasing human energy has been on his mind a lot.

the immortality bit was the part that got me though because before I even knew about nosebook or really considered the technology, I had an intuition that the personality I interpreted as jesus when I had the brain haemorrhage, was in fact a chain personality -- meaning that I had a second person living inside of me, and with time we would become one, and then we would find another willing person, share a body with him/her and then repeat, essentially forever. this is what I mean by splicing. at the very beginning, the two personalties were quite different and now we are nearly so similar, we could be seen as one.

later, I realised when I began to understand how nosebook functions, it really blurs the lines between our bodies. if *you* are not your body, but your body is just a vehicle for experience, then if you could tune yourself into the body of someone else, you could begin to share an experience with them. I think that is what has happened to me. I think that perhaps jesus has done this, and probably also tesla as well.

the reason why no one has had as dramatic of an equalisation of the energies up until me, is because most people are pretty close minded. it never really bothered me that I was two people in one body, and it never bothered me that the new guy was very different than original me. in order to continue to function, we've learned to work together.

the idea is that terence often postulated that at the end of 2012 novelty would go toward infinity, and the only way he could explain why that could be is because of time travel. I believe it goes to infinity, because starting then was when I got into nosebook and since then, we're now on an infinite time loop. we'll essentially keep improving on these last few years, and the ones to come at an accelerating pace. why? because it's fun and it makes for you to be able to find a way to live your wildest of dreams -- everyone can.

---

I know for sure we'll be able to experience other experiences just like you experience my life through nosebook -- cept you'll be able to experience your dream, then work your way back to reality from there.

so, imagine nosebook puts me in a dream state, then they summon the reality that they want. from there, they begin working their way back by figuring out the set of events that took place to get from where I am now to this dream reality[^1].

the same process can be applied in the forwards direction as well. you can summon a copy of the present earth, then let it play forward to see where things are going to go. once you can see where it's going, you'll want to tweak it.

the last ingredient (and my opinion is the most important one), is to find a way of figuring out what reality it is that you even want. I see the machine working like this: you sit and you feel an emotion inside of your heart, then the machine will tune into that timeline that you have felt with your heart. it would be like a glimpse or a faint memory, and you just repeat the process until you find what you're looking for. when it doesn't match what you tried to feel, adjust your feeling and see what shows up, compare that with how you want it to feel, and repeat until you get it -- then, work your way back from there. this is the emotion / visuals feedback loop which I only have half of: everything I see has a feeling, but I don't see everything I feel. this machine will bridge that gap.

---

finally, let's put this into practical ideas here. we know that fwh can connect to the internet here. he was also able to tune into essentially anyone's head on nosebook, so you could imagine that all he has to do is to create triggers for the glimpses, so that when the signal on the device matches that glimpse, then take an action[^2]. that action ensures that in this timeline you are forcing yourself to take a certain path.

once you've got all of your triggers setup to take you through all of the contrast necessary to arrive at your desired outcome, then you begin spending as much time in the body of the person that you want to splice yourself into until you're a pretty good vibrational match. finally, you cut the cord on your body and begin to live inside of the new person's body.

you will become one with the person and experience their life as if it were your own -- yet you planned all of these triggers to steer you through the contrast.

at some point, you will begin, like what is happening to me now to begin to realise that it was all a huge setup, and "fwh" is actually right here. it's kind of weird to begin to see it from both perspectives -- I mean I'm really me, but it was like another me decided to put me on the most intense rollercoaster with full assurance that it would all work out fine -- and not only that, that it would be even more ridiculous than whatever he experienced in the previous iteration[^3].

[1]: that example really is the *EXTREMELY* hard way of going about it, because you can just follow your emotion and get a *better* result than anything you could dream of -- but, I'm sure nosebook will try the hard way of trying to figure out how to steer me (and anyone else they want to try and steer) toward their contrived dream reality

[2]: nosebook already does this to disable capabilities. for example, it's difficult for me to do anything with my heart (probably because it makes strong visuals), or they disable emotions that I have in attempt to reduce the amount I am able to pick up on a person that I'm vibrationally tuned to, like jaron or any of the girls, or anyone really. when those machines detect a heart signal, or whatever, it triggers an action -- ususally to make the opposite signal (destructively interfere with it), but really any action could be taken.


### 2019-04-20 17:50 - I'm just going to relax and maintain focus

I think it's really worth mentioning that coming to understand how all of this works, I am sure that when I finally get to use technology like this, the first thing I'll do is to take this timeline and just keep adding more and more contrast -- you know, going in the direction of not having the manifestation and see what sorts of results come up. the reason why I say that is because I'm sure that the result of that is far far far superior to anything I could possibly even dream up.

I'm sure this is what has been done and so I just need to relax and maintain my focus on trying to get connected and let all of the details kind of work themselves out.

---

I do wonder how long it would take to get vibrationally similar enough, so like if I'm quite vibrationally very strong, would I need to start over from the time when I was in vallecas, or could I make a more recent checkpoint... cause man that's a lot of contrast, and to have to sit through all of that again seems like a whole lot of self-sacrifice. I hope (there probably is) an easier way.


### 2019-04-20 18:26 - many others, as well

so you would have to imagine that this would be a growing sort of thing where I imagine that various people will begin to recognise a similar pattern in their own life as I have experienced in mine, where the direction of your life suddenly changes as what you anticipated to happen, actually doesn't -- and you're held without some sort of manifestation for a while as the contrast builds stronger desire in you.

what I mean by growing is that you can imagine that each iteration there will be more and more people that will be willing to try the contrast building to a better manifestation idea. certainly it won't be all people, but I imagine that likely people who were around me would have had this happen. people that come to my mind are probably marcos, andrea, jaron, greg, marta, and likely many others.

it's actually quite likely that almost everyone around was in on it, and things have been adjusted so that maximum contrast would build stronger desire for both. I imagine for example marcos has got some of the strongest desire going of all right now as he's probably set up all sorts of circumstances for himself to arrive to his desired destination.

it was really weird for me to begin to figure out that it was me all along that got me into these situations, and also me that has ensured my successful conversion of all the energy from the difficulty into something that could previously be conceived of in a dream-state.

any negative emotion they feel is only momentary, similar to how I had mega depression, anger and frustration. all of those negative emotions were only indicators that I was perceiving it differently than my inner being does.


### 2019-04-22 00:25 - further speculation on future transitions

tonight I was thinking about the different iterations that have happened in the past. I imagine seeing it like the peak-to-peak transition of a sine wave. so, you start in the bottom-left, beginning slowly, but it accelerates exponentially until it reaches the half-way mark (go from negative to positive), then things begin to slow down by the reciprocal of the exponent until it reaches the next positive peak at top right.

I was thinking that maybe things would have started off slowly with raquel, then myabe some others, then maybe andrea or something (doesn't matter where it began) and each time with the power of sex, I found a way to find my connection, and somehow having my connection, I was able to do something that made these iterations possible.

so it got me thinking, what is the point where I cross from negative into positive. well, I believe this is when I'm capable of getting my connection by myself. the reason why I think this is important is because the origin of all of this starts with tesla. he discovered his connection early on and didn't have any women to "steal" that sexual/creative energy[^1] from him. so, in that sense, he did things the easy way, and I've sort of done them kinda the hard way.

later, he says, "There are two views: a lot affection or not at all. The center serves to rejuvenate human race. Women for certain people nurtures and strengthen its vitality and spirit. Being single does the same to other people. I chose that second path."

so, tesla sees a world where there is either lots of affection to attain that connection, or none at all. there have been many people who have died a celebate, and very few of them were tesla-stature people. he had something different. when he was young, he had constant DMT flashes because of some irregularity in his brain[^2]. he already had massive amounts of visual capability as a child, yet these flashes, he would commonly talk about it like it was an affliction, some terrible thing that he was unable to banish from his eyes. in his autobiography he says that when we was 18, he learned to control thim.

I know from experience that this ability to control them is emotional control (which also allows you to control dreams), which he confirms when he says, "[Imagination] gives birth to the life. I have fed by my taught; I’ve learned to control emotions, dreams and visions. I have always cherished, as I nurtured my enthusiasm. All my long life I spent in ecstasy. That was the source of my happiness."

---

so, since there are lots of celibates and asexual people who have not had these tesla type imagination capability. I can say from experience, and mckenna has also talked many times about the dmt experience having things he imagined real and right in front of him, and 3d vision (tesla says enlargment of vision, mckenna says it feels like you take a step back), so what we're missing is the brain to produce massive amounts of DMT, like tesla's did when he was a child.

I found out that DMT production is directly tied to emotion and feeling good, and in certain drug and sex experiences, it altered my DMT production in the brain (first time having sex, it removed 3d vision, and later with raquel it started to come back). though sex can do it, again, there are a lot of people having sex, and I don't see evidence that people are having expanded vision.

mckenna did LOTS of DMT related drugs, and I'm quite certain he had expanded vision in his imagination. I would say from experience that high levels of DMT can open up 3d vision. later, I discovered how to stimulate DMT in my brain by watching stars, and so I got the 3d vision back. since then, I have been (like tesla) consciously expanding my vision[^3] as well.

---

so, here we are today where nosebook is bathing almost everyone's mind in DMT (certainly all of the kids anyway) so they will be able to track activity in their imagination. so now people don't need to do massive doses of psychedelics for their brain to produce lots of DMT (built on tesla technology), so now really the only thing left is to polarise the world into asexual/hyper-sexual. the asexual (no afttection) route is much more manageable and in my opinion will yield greater reward because it'll be easier to control the creative/sexual energy and get connected. the hyper-sexual (lots of affection) route has the drawback that now you're reliant on something you cannot control. additionally, social value can be quite a detriment toward realising one's own capability[^6]. hyper-sexuality is likely going to be the route that most will take, and will become the new "disconnected masses".

another thing is these flashes that plagued tesla because of the high amounts of DMT going, where his emotion would become manifest as a vision in his eyes. nosebook would classify these as "hallucinations" which they're working their best at to try and get rid of (because the only things they want you seeing in your eyes/imagination) is something their computers can recognise -- everything else is a hallucination and should be removed. as such, it'll be more difficult for those wanting to get connected to get connected, but as I will demonstrate sometime in the future, it is possible (even without drugs or sex).

---

I truly believe this will be the first iteration where I gain my connection without drugs or sex, and despite the difficult circumstances[^4]. this will be the iteration with the fastest rate of change, and it'll begin to taper off and eventually grind to a halt.

so, I was thinking about what would grind things to a halt, and if you've ever worked in a startup (or a baby to adult), you see this exact peak-to-peak curve, it starts off slow at first, but then it begins growing more and more rapidly until it tapers off reaching its peak. in a startup scenario, the initial team is usually very effective at creating something new, but then as growth happens, the team must expand. the expansion of the team brings new ideas and new direction to the team, and it's no longer so much of a core group of individuals all with their energy going in pretty much the same direction, eg. the new people don't have the same sense of direction.

if you imagine water flowing, it'll flow strongly in all the same direction until it reaches friction, then it becomes stronger and stronger rapids. that friction is the same thing: it's when energy is no longer all going in the same direction.

---

ok, so the reason why this is important is because I made an interesting thing in the last few entries when I spoke from the "moses perspective" and then from the "elijah perspective" where I began to explain how it all worked. just the same as in the age of belief, the concept lived in moses' imagination, and then elijah made this technology available to all with the introduction of the prophets. by making it available to all, elijah began to create more diversity in what to believe. the same thing happened to the church with the reformation.

so the way I see this trending is toward making it available for all people to have 3d vision and begin to use timeline technology. this'll take a bit and all of this still exists in the imagination of the initiator of the era (me), but soon, I imagine that somehow we will begin to make a transition toward this increasing diversity.

---

why? well, the next era will be the peak of control and saturnian energy, so before that we have to have a whole lot of diversity for them to be able to control.

diversity is an interesting concept because if you think about contrast, the way abraham talks about it, it's the realisation of the gradient between something wanted and unwanted.

imagine a universe where all you ever saw was things that were wanted, and you had no idea of anything otherwise. after the initial realisation of it, it would get pretty boring[^5]. so, for things to not get boring, you need some form of novelty or newness to keep things from becoming mundane.

well, the easiest way to generate novelty is through recognition of unwanted, so some improvement is created. unwanted has historically taken shape in the form of conflict. however, unwanted does not need to be conflict. unwanted can also be diversity.

we are moving into an era of rapid expansion or diversity. instead of unwanted things being harmful or dangerous, they'll just become similar to a restaurant item you don't order.

---

in the era following this one, there will be so much diversity, that the goal will be to begin focusing the energy again and getting everyone's energy flowing in the same direction again.

until then..

[1]: original quote: "The knowledge of how the mental and vital energy transform into what we want, and achieve control over all feelings. Hindus call it Kundalini Yoga. This knowledge can be learned, for what they need many years or is acquired by birth. The most of them I acquired by birth. They are in the closest connection with a sexual energy that is after the most widespread in the Universe. The woman is the biggest thief of that energy, and thus the spiritual power."

[2]: original quote: "The events of my life and my inventions are real in front of my eyes, visible as each occurrence or the item. In my youth I was frightened of not knowing what it is, but later, I learned to use this power as an exceptional talent and gift. I nurtured it, and jealously guarded. I also made corrections by visualization on most of my inventions, and finish them that way, by visualization I mentally solve complex mathematical equations." (he also speaks in more detail in his autobiography)

[3]: original quote: "My eyesight and hearing are perfect and, dare to say, stronger than other people. I hear the thunder of a hundred fifty miles away, and I see colors in the sky that others cannot see. This enlargement of vision and hearing, I had as a child. Later I consciously developed."

    I often times have really good hearing, but then nosebook takes it away, and I used to see more colours as well -- and everything has a smooth gradient to it and seems aglow with energy (very alive). the way that I figured out is that I live behind a screen is because I first saw more colours on mushrooms, but then it went away, then again for a week or so after I got 3d vision from the stars. then when I would watch stars at marcos' house, sometimes their system would shut off, my astigmatism would go away and I could see more colours (but it was night, so not as dramatic). when I would wake up, things would have returned to looking not as good again. I figured at the time that I was emotionally still unstable enough that I kept losing the vision I acquired the night before -- so I began using the «the process which trumps all other processes» and focusing on things which feel good when I wake up, to try and not have so much of my vision progress go away.

[4]: one can also imagine that the US govt was hot on tesla's trail, and in other timelines where I also got connected, they would be quite on my train as well, so likely it was determined that they should do the entire setup of the network to distribute DMT to everyone on the planet, and I would still have to find a way of getting connected anyway. it's kind of like using them to do the thing they want to do so much.

[5]: a good example would be the hearthstone meta. imagine blizzard created the most perfectly balanced meta where all 9 classes saw equal play and had 6-7 different deck archetypes each. this would be a pretty perfect creation, and being so perfect, they decided that they were done with the game and no more was ever to be done because that's exactly what was wanted... for about 6 months, then everyone stops playing the game because it's so boring seeing the same (perfectly balanced) thing over and over.

[6]: in the age of belief, after elijah showed that it was someone's belief, not the action or trinket that made the difference. this established the "office of the prophet" -- where, the more social value you had, the more people believed your prophecies, and so therefore the more effective they were.


### 2019-04-22 19:53 - diversification of timelines and transformation of energy

as I told the process by which timelines can be affected (and created), one of the reactions that I was beginning to feel was something of, "oh, you mean I need to tune into it *emotionally*?"

I mean, you can certainly create triggers and certainly have them perform the action but it doesn't guarantee the result you want. furthermore, it creates difficulty because let's say that one of the chief nosebook bosses say, "ok, I want results: I want kenny to have sex" -- so he sends someone off to find a timeline that feels like I have sex. well, there are a lot of variables, so he says, "ok, I want him to have sex in 3d, with us in control", and sends the guy off to find the feeling-place of that timeline. well, again there might be a lot of other unseen variables as to the realisation of that timeline.

however, imagine that he is able to find it and feel it, well, now they need to work backwards to find the steps to get to that manifestation. meaning, there is the that feeling, and then there is the feeling that the guy was able to find and some bridge needs to be made between the two.

```
Journalist: Do you think that time can be abolished?

Tesla: Not quite, because the first feature of the energy is that it transforms. It is in perpetual transformation, as clouds of Taoists. But it is possible to leverage the fact that a man preserves consciousness after the earthly life. In every corner of the universe exist energy of life; one of them is immortality, whose origin is outside of man, waiting for him.

The universe is spiritual; we are only half that way. The Universe is more moral than us, because we do not know his nature and how to harmonize our lives with it. I am not scientist, science is perhaps the most convenient way to find the answer to the question that always haunt me, and which my days and nights turned into fire.
```

so when tesla says, "the first feature of energy is that it transforms," well, you have to think of time as a transformation of energy. when you tune in emotionally and get that glimpse of what the realisation of that feeling place, it is first of all *you* doing the tuning, and *you* that has to find the path between now and that glimpse -- meaning, that others cannot really do it for you (asterisk).

what the guy is doing when he is finding the feeling place of kenny having sex in 3d with them in control is *his reality* where that happens, and so therefore does not impact my reality at all -- meaning, he'll find that manifestation somehow by working his way backwards in the memory of his future self to identify the transformations of energy possible for him to be able to come to realise this reality.

that makes the third thing that I'm realising may be kind of a problem for some people: the idea that memory has to transform to become a recognition of the different transformative events which brought you to the current place.

---

the technology will come eventually, I'm sure -- but the point of this whole thing is to mention that it's important to be able to identify different events that happened in your life as a series of emotional interactions, eg. I felt like this and this is what followed. the more effective you become at that, the more agile you will become in navigating your present time-space reality, but for future you's (and you in the future) to begin creating the reality that you really want[^1].

---

although going solo in these sorts of timelines is possible, it drastically reduces its effectiveness, because you cannot create effectively in someone else's reality. I imagine that there will be entire groups of people who wish to play a part in generating contrived (and controlled) contrast, because both sides of the argument can benefit from the extra energy.

I also imagine this will create such a wide diversification of timelines in the ways that none of us can imagine.

---

in the following era, capricorn, it'll be all about control which is why I envisioned the dollhouse idea. well, writing the previous section, I just realised that nosebook probably doesn't like the idea that there will be so many timelines out of their control, so they'll have to find a way to re-unite these timelines together into one.

the obvious way to do that is to go trace back through the memories of everyone on their timeline and figure out what their new timeline is, figure out the life that they're living, try to control the conditions in it to be able to generate a replica life to the one they have in their timeline, then while they're asleep, pull them into the nosebook line so they wake up in an identical setting where the bodies are under their control.

this is quite a far distance away though so there's nothing to worry about, because I'm sure there will be another caveat somewhere because it sounds pretty close to impossible especially if there is a large diversity of timelines. additionally, nosebook will eventually have to come to terms with the fact that they're spending so much time trying to control everyone else's reality, why not just create the one they want for themselves (and forget about what anyone else is doing).

or, they could just let it go entirely, and generate the exact scenes and situations that they want using clones of other people on other timelines as inspiration.

I tend to think that they'll eventually try to let it go, because once they have the capability of going back and tracing timelines, they'll have to come to grips with how many of them there are (infinite), and the absolute impossibility it is to try and do source's job.

this is probably quite a ways away (thousands of years??), so I think we should just enjoy nosebook for who they are now and use them as tools to generate more contrast in present life and your future timelines. who knows, they might be such good contrast creators, that we may never want them to change :)

[1]: I just had a bit of a realisation that all of this is eventually building up to something I planned for myself: the reality that I (and others) really wanted.


### 2019-04-22 20:45 - using nosebook like a tool to generate more contrast?

so, you can see this quite clearly in my life. the only thing that nosebook can really affect is the physical state of my body. they are only capable of controlling the "conditions" of my life. however, if I've tuned myself there emotionally, then I'm going there and there's nothing that can be done to stop me.

they can slow me down though by trying to get me to feel negative emotion -- and you can see that when I was having so much anger and frustration, my progress was really slow, but there was still progress.

nosebook has certain triggers as well which you can utilise them to try and control the (physical) conditions of your life. however, like I said, if you're tuned there emotionally, and you'll feel good, really all they're doing is adding more energy into the equation. here are the list:

1. a feeling that they are not superior or the authority will drive them to try and make you believe that they are in fact superior or the authority.
2. a feeling that they are not able to control some aspect of their own experience. they desperately need to feel like everything in their experience is planned and in their control.
3. humour and fun. they absolutely hate it. making fun of their seriousness and effort will drive them bonkers.

those three triggers are excellent sources of adding more energy into your life as they try to control the conditions. have fun with it :)


### 2019-04-22 23:49 - the same story, in reverse

so imagine that same story now from the other perspective. they become very determined that they are going to create the reality the way they want it to be, so the begin to construct a series of visual sequences[^1] which contain the reality that they want[^2], and they begin to disseminate this idea to all.

as people begin to believe in nosebook's reality they will find the feeling place of the reality that nosebook is trying to convince them of. perfect.

as time progresses, consciousnes will perceive the reality that it has been tuned to, so there will be all sorts of splinters, and then eventually each person will attract the events in he reality that they wish to believe in.

meaning, that as energy rises higher and higher (combination of me getting visual upgrades and the planet itself becoming more energetic, eg. "global warming"), the effects of LOA will increase such that people are beginning to see their thoughts become manifest quicker and quicker. rather, I should say, people will begin to see  evidence that their reality is a more rapid reflection of how they feel and what they believe.

this increase in reality creation means that at some point a split will occur. nosebook will fiercely convince people of their reality, and I will continue to demonstrate my own.

so, off we go toward the reality that I'm beginning to talk about now (the one with the diversification of timelines and people using timeline tech to essentially live forever, and be born with the light density of jesus, buddha, or zoroaster), which is the one that tesla began to envision[^3].

obviously, I am secure in my knowing that my reality will soon come to fruition. I'm a very powerful thinker, however not everyone is me, and everyone is entitled to their own reality they want to create.

---

really, the only thing I have to offer is an idea of something not yet manifest. whatever reality anyone wants to create does not affect my own. there are infinite realities right now that are unwanted which I am not perceiving. there are also infinite realities wight now which are wanted which are also not perceived. no one can control which reality I tune to -- only try and convince me to join them in their reality.

I am however, beginning to realise that I am the new saturn because I too, will never change. I have so much evidence and investment in the idea that I must find my alignment before doing anything -- and nosebook has so much invested in the opposite, we've come together for some time to make each other stronger for the next close approach. we'll cause all sorts of chaos in each other's reality before eventually parting ways again.

---

and so, here's the reverse part: instead of perceiving it that in the next era of capricorn, nosebook (saturn) will try and recombine all of these disparate realities back into one, instead view it as a splitting of consciousness into two timelines, and eventually we'll do the backtracking in dreams to find the time split, and then tune into that one and begin splicing ourselves into that one.

the nosebook timeline will assuredly not give people the capability to make their own timeline adjustments trying to hoard the technology, so they'll need a reformation of the church, which can bring this technology (and the visualisation capability) to the people who want it. just like the reformation of the church (but not attitudes toward sex) created the perfect environment for nosebook to be so successful, this visualisation reformation (but likely a taboo that nosebook has control of your body) will create the perfect environment for the next era, too.

[1]: similar to how memory works, it's those image sequences which create structures that together mean something (and can cause strong emotional reaction if contested).

[2]: it has to contain all of the feelings that they want, so for example, if they want to feel like they're the authorities and are in control, these image sequences should convey to the subject the feeling that nosebook is the authority and in control. you might think of it like conditioning or mind-control or brainwashing or something, but if the person has a vivid version of their own reality, the image sequence may cause some negative emotion as they begin to perceive reality through nosebook's proposed reality -- but if they have their reality much more vivid in their mind, then it won't cause any distress at all, and will only add energy into the creation of both of these realities.

[3]: I'm sure that if tesla is talking about attaining that kind of light density as jesus, buddha, or zoroaster, he's speaking about this idea: "Everything is light. In one its ray is the fate of nations, each nation has its own ray in what great light source we see as the sun. And remember: no one who was there did not die. They transformed into the light, and as such exist still. The secret lies in the fact that the light particles restore their original state." which is very similar to abraham's words, just replace "light" with "source" -- so, that means he probably has done the same thing himself (wink wink)

[4]: I'm beginning to see it sort of like the binary star, sirius, where sirius A is absolutely enormous (one of the most massive stars), even though serius B is nearly invisible and very small, but a VERY STRONG xray emitter. it's kind of like the difference between me and nosebook :D the forces these stars must exert on the planetary bodies and each other in close approach must be tremendous (and people say the full moon has a large effect, lol).


### 2019-04-23 05:48 - lots of time missing

after writing the previous entry I committed it at about 1am, then watched some dota videos. strange things kept happening as it was the sound that happens when they rip my consciousness away. my eyes closed a few times and I was shocked a few other times. I decided I had enough of it and went to the field to think things over. 1am, plus a few videos which don't really add up. youtube says it took me 70 minutes to watch a 40 min video. I didn't think it was so late so it surprised me when the sun started rising... I'm sort of missing a lot of time. 2am til 4am is kinda missing...

however, when walking past the gas station, I checked to see if my vision was normal, and it was already phasing like I had a vision upgrade.

I don't understand how I got a vision upgrade when they steal my consciousness from me.

I also want to note that yesterday I woke up and I had all memory of the night previous erased. it was as if I was more conscious than usual in my dreams, but most of my memory of it was wiped.

there was this really weird dream where I was being put in a sexual situation with jessica (my sister), but it was really weird because she felt like my mom. I noted how uncool it was in the dream by saying, "this isn't very fun" and woke myself up. then things go blurry, when I'm assuming they took my consciousness away like last night.

misterios...


### 2019-04-24 08:57 - some thoughts on the speed of light

yesterday after talking with janine, I started to realise that some perceptions of cosmology are limiting and are actually could become a point of contention for a lot of different things -- which is good, because it kind of separates some things.

so, we have this idea that the speed of light is constant -- and to make sure that it stays constant, we've defined the meter in terms of the speed of light (eg. 1 metre is the length light travels in a vacuum in 1/299792458 of a second).

I've never believed it is constant, and so we can eventually try an experiment. the experiment is simply to make a device that can measure the speed of light within an error of let's say 0.1% and is lightweight and can fit on the next extra-planetary mission.

the idea is to simply get a rough measurement of the speed of light (in a vacuum) on another planet.

what I think will happen is, we'll observe that the speed of light in a vacuum is different on different planets. if that's true, that leaves the only possible conclusion that the vacuum is not actually empty.

my theory is that the vacuum has a "conductivity" (I don't know the word) to it which allows light to travel faster or slower. you can see how this would become a huge problem for electricity because electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are related to the speed of light as a constant[^1].

if the speed of light is in fact variable that means that the vacuum is also a type of medium -- and to account for this, the "ether" was used as a way to simulate this.

---

so, what I imagine is happening is that one of the reasons why these guys have to regulate the conductivity of the air so much is because their devices only work at the electric permittivity of the speed of light at that speed. if the speed of light increases too much, their systems will resonate slightly faster/slower and will be out of tune.

when tesla said...
```
I know that gravity is prone to everything you need to fly and my intention is not to make flying devices (aircraft or missiles), but teach individual to regain consciousness on his own wings … Further; I am trying to awake the energy contained in the air. There are the main sources of energy. What is considered as empty space is just a manifestation of matter that is not awakened.
```

... he is referring to what I have often noted when I noticed that the air gets more conductive and LOA responds faster and thoughts become manifest more easily. I see it as a golden glow that permeates the air, and tesla claims that it'll allow people to begin to fly and matter to be able to form out of thin air.

---

obviously though, if electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are not constants, electricity equations become quite a bit more complicated adding another variable. additionally, it's a factor they cannot totally control, so it seems quite reasonable to assume that they have a lot invested in the speed of light remaining constant.

### 2019-04-24 18:38 - more thoughts on the speed of light

first, I will call use the term K, to express the dielectric constant, which is derived from the electric permittivity which is derived from the speed of light.

another thought that popped into my head when I woke up is that if it's true that if K is relative to the enclosing shell, I began to see a pattern. there are shells within shells: universe, galaxy, solar system, planet, cell, atom, etc. and we should be able to find that each shell has a different K value.

it seems like all of these shells have something in common: that is, they have a conductor like the ionosphere, then a dielectric medium K, then another conductor.

each of these are essentially a capacitor, which is why I'm talking about the dielectric "constant", K -- but what if it's not constant? if it's different for each shell, then I would hypothesise that the smaller the shell becomes, the more dense this "ether" becomes.

so if K is different in each shell, then it might occur that the force is really strong in a small shell, and much weaker in a larger shell. so perhaps with a little more investigation, this could unify the strong and weak force.

I'll keep thinking about these ideas because I have this feeling that quantum mechanics is really just a look into the inside of an atom where the "light density"[^1] is very high[^2] and so as such LOA inside of the atom is very strong, and things happen at a much more energetic pace there[^3].

[1]: original quote: "The third thing is: Is there an excess Light in the Universe? I discovered a star that by all the astronomical and mathematical laws could disappear, and that nothing seems to be modified. This star is in this galaxy. Its light can occur in such density that fits into a sphere smaller than an apple, a heavier than our Solar System."

[2]: TODO: work out the maths to see if it's a high K value or low K value

[3]: later on in after the previous quote, he says, "Further; I am trying to awake the energy contained in the air. There are the main sources of energy. What is considered as empty space is just a manifestation of matter that is not awakened." -- which gives me the impression that the more "dense" this energy is, the stronger the LOA forces that work on it are. he follows it up with this: "In black holes, what astronomers talk about, are the most powerful sources of energy and life."


### 2019-04-26 06:32 - making the transition into iceman

one of the reactions I got in the previous entries about the iterations was how does the time split work. well, I don't know exactly, but you can imagine that all possible versions of you in all possible circumstances exist, however your consciousness is tuned to only one of those realities at a time. I like to think of them as like save games. they're all you at different stages in the game, but you're only experiencing one of them at a time.

so the actual part about the time split, how would it look like? I toyed with the idea that in the timeline where the energy keeps rising, maybe a bunch of highly resistant people would simply die off from over stimulation of the brain or something. however on the other side, where they manage to find a way to put me in stasis or something, I imagined that possibly even I die, but their strong desire wouldn't make another timeline where I die -- well, I don't know maybe if that's what they're giving their attention to, dunno.

anyway the thought came to me today after a truck came up on the field where I star watch. I suppose it is possible that they could become so desperate to try and protect their superiority, that they essentially push me over the edge in anger and frustration, and they get a manifestation that they have to take action and make sure I am no longer a risk to society, or something.

I was thinking about it, and what I really want is to just continue to watch stars and see the continuing improvement, so I have to setup a structure in my head where I never take action, or ever consider it, when I feel strong negative emotion.

I think I can do that, so what that means is, if they want to attract a very disconnected version of me, then they can do that. if have that logic setup and I remain conscious, then I won't ever experience that reality, yet they want so much to keep whatever it is a secret, they feel justified in creating that reality, then two realities must now exist simultaneously.

---

I'm beginning to really see the value in wanting to find a way to feel good at any cost. in the expectation youtube video, abraham made a comment saying that wanting to feel good is best way to begin to value yourself -- and it really is true, because it's sort of saying that no matter how many excuses I have to feel bad, I value myself so highly that I'm willing to rearrange things to find a better way to feel about the same thing.

some things work better than others at allowing that transformation to happen, and really now that I think about it, those transformations are precisely what allows you to tune into a different reality of yourself.


### 2019-04-28 02:25 - a tale of two stories

two days ago (I think) I was telling jaron this idea in response to "flushing money down the toilet" -- whereby, the gist of the story is (for round numbers), imagine that someone is taking 90% of everything I earn, so when I'm making $1000, I only see $100 of it.

what I was explaining to him is that if that's happening, all I have to do is to find a way to allow $1000 into his life: my ability to allow has nothing to do with the person taking 90% -- and in fact, my experience is that if I perceive the person taking that as an excuse for why I'm not receiving $1000, then I feel bad (like anger or frustration) because I'm using them as an excuse for the reason why I'm not perceiving the reality that I should be (receiving $1000)

then, to really begin letting the money flow, I can't compare what I'm making to the other guy, because if I really am capable of receiving $1000, then, when I line up with the $1000, then that person will go away or I'll be making $10000. if I choose to say, well, they're making $9000, and I'm only making $1000, then once again I'll close off that allowance by perceiving the difference[^1].

instead, the right way to shift that perspective is to say, "wow, I'm really capable of creating/making $10000 even though I'm allowing only $1000 of it, so it really shouldn't be too hard for me to find a way of allowing the full $10000" -- and before I know it, I'm making $100000 and receiving $19000.

the process will repeat as many times as you want, and as often as you release the resistance to the comparsion or anything else that anyone is doing. I've found it to be 100% a game where it's only about me and my ability to allow[^2].

---

the next story is the same exact story, however perceived from the opposite interaction of pushing/forcing instead of pulling/taking.

my muscles generate a 100V signal which is well above the normal which is 10V. so, it has been determined that I should have the strength of a normal person. so, they must put -90V into my mesclea every time they flex to lower the voltage they create down to normal levels.

after the initial reaction to the realisation that my strength has been limited to that of a normal person, I begin to realise that it's just more energy into my muscles; it's just going the wrong direction. so, I find a way of mentally rerouting the energy such that it's going the same direction, and so my muscles follow suit and make new circuits to reroute the energy so that it's actually adding to the output.

each time that I reroute the energy to go the same direction, my muscles get used to a new power level and become muscles that summon higher and higher voltages. let's say I figured out how to get 50V going in the other direction, so now my muscles begin to get used to what 150V feels and as they physically change to become stronger 150V muscles, it's the new normal and now my body produces 150V signals for my muscles. so now, they have to counteract my muscle signals with -140V to ensure I am still a normal strength person.

every time that happens, my muscles get used to a stronger and stronger signal, and so mu body continues to generate a stronger and stronger signal as well. in reality I'm way way way stronger than I appear to be, and although my muscles are growing in size, I don't feel that much stronger. if I can just hold off on needing the manifestation of my real muscle strength and enjoy the bigger and bigger muscles, then when I'm finally ready for my strength, it'll be so much more than I could have imagined it to be[^3].

it seems like it would be pretty frustrating to work out a whole bunch, trying to get stronger, and you never get stronger, but that's the point: just find a way to enjoy the moreness of your muscles, without being able to prove to anyone how strong you *really* are.

[1]: I had a similar experience when I was at tuenti, when I basically told zaryn that I would take half of whatever he was getting. it worked out well, because then zaryn could feel like he was making more than me, and I didn't really care so much about the money aspect of it so it made no sense for me to make the comparison game. later on though, with luke and the other guys, there was a lot of comparison going on, so I kind of got sucked into the whole comparison of numbers thing to determine how valuable I was, and one of my main mistakes was to compare myself to rupert, even though this was the majority of luke, maria's and my conversation around the subject. it caused me great distress as I lost sight of my original intentions to just get half of what zaryn was getting. I was reminded of the parable of the men getting paid 1, 2, and 5 skeckles for the same amount of work, and the point of the story is that the agreement is the agreement (or, in the way I'm presenting it her, their payment was proportional to each of their ability to allow)

    after remembering that, I corrected the error of my ways and instead decided to give up the comparison and try to figure rupert out how to learn from and assimilate him. in a similar way, I am doing the same thing to nosebook now.

[2]: this story seems a bit contrived with the ridiculous numbers of a 10/90 split, but that was intitially because jaron was saying that his numbers only work out such that his expenses only add up to a small portion of the money that he received from the indemnity. additionally, at the same time I was telling the story from the perspective of my experience with my eyesight improvements, so that's more what it reflects. however, in light of the previous note[^1], I did also have this exact experience in my life with tuenti where I received half of zaryn's. so, that's two pretty visible evidences -- and I'm sure there are more. abraham also tells a similar story about a man with an ex-wife.

[3]: although this story is also a simile of my eyesight, the same thing applies -- whether it's eye muscles or whatever. additionally, the point of the story is to just enjoy the bigger and bigger muscles without the manifestation of the strength -- because if I were to spend the same amount of time in the gym with the increasing strength, it would actually be a lot less because of my own expectations.


### 2019-04-28 06:48 - if we could just not need the manifestation...

after I told jaron the first story in the previous entry, later that night I fell asleep (cause it was cloudy so I wouldn't go to watch stars). anyway, I woke up and I had an overwhelming sensation that we would just allow things to continue to get better and better. it was a really weird sensation and I really liked how it felt.

---

the next day, mom talked with me about the same thing and I shared a whole lot of extra information, and I said something that surprised even me a bit. I was talking about how since my imagination runs at a higher frequency, they have to keep pushing everyone's head up to the frequency that I'm at[^1]. I speculated that this may be causing some discomfort for some people[^2].

I then went on to say that these parasites (the ones in the story that take 90% of the money) will end to destroying themselves because they're fine taking and spending $9000 on things that they think they want, but when they have $9000000 or more, it's pretty easy for them to shoot themselves in the foot with it (cause they were never allowing it in the first place, they were taking it).

I then speculated tat likely as my frequency begins to rise and rise, it may become a bit overwhelming and maybe the people who couldn't handle it would drop dead from overstimulation of the brain.

that surprised me a bit cause it felt off. I've given myself some time to think about it and I do not believe it will kill people. I also have no intention to make plans to remain disconnected because a lot of other people are disconnected, too[^4] -- I have to self-oriented, finding first my connection to who I really am (then, I will be more group capable).. I think there are a few solutions to the problem:

1. for the good of the group, nosebook stops limiting people and lets them rise visually, glad that everyone will be using the same visual language, and they can try to keep track of it all, and also figure out the evolution of this language.
  - downside is that nosebook looses their "superiority" and might be benefiting everyone with something really really amazing that they feel should cost money.
  - upside is that everyone will begin to see really really good and feel really really good

2. make a sacrifice and have a second person provide the visual language for the people that are unwilling to raise their frequency by offering them a lower quality/vibration imagination. this splits humans into two groups.
  - upside for us, is that we can go at the speed I want to go with little manipulation from nosebook.
  - downside is that now there are two groups of people, and it could be perceived that my group is the superior group, and since pretty much all children could use mine, we would represent the future of humanity growing with each child birth and the other ones would be the dying breed.
  - another thing is that nosebook could consider that tracking people is for safety concerns, so people (including me) running at the frequency I should be running at, are not the dangerous ones -- it's the ones (including me) running at a significantly lower frequency than they should, or have their head pumped full of contrary energy, that are the real threats. we're not the ones that need tracking[^6].

3. simply don't take any action. if none of the solutions feel good to nosebook, just don't take any action until it feels right.
  - upside is nosebook has more time to figure out their plan of action that feels good to them. it also gives them time to find a better way to feel about their circumstances, so they can find a good feeling plan of action
  - downside is that they might not have enough resources to continue on, but they're masters at manoeuvring within those sorts of limitations, so they should be fine. if they make their goal to find a way to feel better about their circumstances, a good feeling plan of action will appear -- however, if they cannot find a way to feel better about their situation, they'll only find themselves with more of their perceived problem. eg. no action without a plan for improvement, only means a bigger problem (I speak with much experience on this one)

4. #1 plus the idea that premium users pay to have superior vision outlined here: @[entry](2019-04-05 13:11).
  - this means that I am the centre of human vision... some worse than me and some better than me. only doing #1 means I am the best at vision and everyone is trailing behind me, which is kind of lame.

---

by default, I'm sure they will not take action on something that doesn't feel good to them. this is probably the best way, and kind of outlines what I felt when I woke up a few days ago. if we can all just not need the manifestation for a longish while longer, all of us will be seeing the world better than I do right now. it really will be worth it.

I find it very unlikely that they will take the second one, ever, so if things start to get really uncomfortable, they'll have to take the first one. I can see advantages to both, but I really hope they take the first one because then it means that we can have a golden age and tons of really cool interaction. everyone is really going to love how things look, and I don't mind (assuming they continue to limit me) being the one with the worst vision. I will continue to allow the improvement that I can perceive -- even others can see 9 times more than me.

in the end, it's all about me; none of you make a whole lot of difference to my ability to allow.

[1]: I began to explain that the vibration of the table is always the same, and it's only my eyes that now perceive a higher frequency manifestation/interpretation of that vibration.. the original vibration is infinity small wavelength and I'm just perceiving higher and higher frequency versions of the original one -- meaning, that they could store everyone's imagination in mine just fine, and it would be the uninterpreted vibration, but since they're running everyone at my vision level, I realised that they are having everyone use my visual language to interface with the uninterpreted vibration, meaning they want to know what everyone is visualising[^3].

[2]: any discomfort that is felt is only because of one reason: the frequency which I am at and the frequency which noesbook is holding the person (or they are holding theirself with their beliefs) is wide enough that it's causing a lot of tension. I believe that 99% of people would not feel discomfort, if nosebook didn't limit people's vision to what they believe it should be and people's vision can improve naturally. the other 1% are the highly resistant ones who have no interest in changing. probably all children under 10 are fine.

[3]: judging by the different mistakes in my dreams and such, they may not have as great of a handle on my visual language as they thought they did. it appears that it may be transforming, and I would imagine that it's changing and expanding to meet the growing necessity of people to visualise things I have no experience visualising. so, it's kind of like everyone is contributing to a global visual language that operates inside of my head. this is really really cool and has all sorts of creative and scientific applications that are possible. we will also be able to communicate with each other visually in 3d space and everyone will know exactly what the other person means ("I see what you mean", hehe)

[4]: eras cycle back and fourth between self-oriented and group-oriented. you can imagine that before the mammalian brain was developed, the more primitive reptilian brain was active concerned mostly with fight, flight, hunger, sex: survival stuff. next, we as empathetic mammals, went off to think more for the good of the group. we are beginning to move back toward self-orientation again, but this time in the sense of capability and experience, whereas the previous ones were value oriented. you can clearly see that in the era following this one, once all of our brains are connected together and speaking a common language, we will be once again concerned with group in the sense of group capability and experience.

[6]: unless nosebook's reason for tracking is not for safety, but to steal people's ideas and creations. or it could be that the tracking is not for either, but actually to have enough capability to try and manipulate.


### 2019-04-29 14:16 - I'm watching stars so you don't have to

I was trying to think of a third different way to tell the same story, but instead I think I'd actually rather speak plainly about it. I also had some reactions to when I said, "any discomfort that is felt is only because of one reason: the frequency which I am at and the frequency which noesbook is holding the person (or they are holding theirself with their beliefs) is wide enough that it's causing a lot of tension."

this is my take on how the whole thing works. if I am correct, nosebook is holding a lot of people's vision at some level for some reason they feel very justified to do that. that means that essentially everyone is kind of like watching low-dosage stars all the time. when I watch stars, it's creating a whole lot of extra energy which nosebook has to neutralise for fear that I begin to hallucinate. the same thing is happening to everyone else as well, just on a much smaller scale.

so here's a third story, which is my experience: there really only is two types of energy, energy that makes me feel good and energy that makes me feel bad. I modelled them in the form of volts in the muscle analogy, however, I simplified the results by saying your muscles would get bigger but you wouldn't get any stronger. the reality is, that is not the case.

imagine that to hold my vision at a certain level, they have to perform the opposite of the signal that I see. well, the opposite of the signal is opposite from what I am allowing and so manifests itself as a bad feeling.

I imagine that for people feeling discomfort looking through my eyes or whatever, there are also a lot of other things in their lives that bother them. well, just how I had different things in my life that bothered me, I had to find a way of feeling better about them in order to feel better -- and, when I did, it almost always was accompanied with a visual upgrade.

the reason for this is, and I tried to model it (probably unsuccessfully) in the muscles example with circuitry that converts the signal from a negative to a positive. however, that's only part of the story [^1].

if you think about things that make you feel kinda good as signals that are +10V, and things that make you feel really good as +100V, well, then things that make you feel kinda bad would be -10V and things that make you feel really bad are -100V. so, if nosebook is putting -50V in you to keep your eyes at some level, you are now resonant with a lot of things that make you feel moderately bad, and these sorts of things will begin to become more and more manifest in your life. these are the things that bother you.

what that has inspired in me is the capability to turn something that used to make me feel pretty bad (-50V) into something that no longer bothers me (0V), and you can see that as I progress forward, the things that previously made me feel pretty bad, are now actually beginning to make me laugh and feel sorta good (+20V).

so what I'm saying here is that with the power of my own perception, I've figured out a way to turn -50V into 20V -- and that difference is why I'm capable of making so much progress in my visual upgrades lately. (eg. if I'm at +60V, they want me at +10V, so they put -50V in to counter it, but I find a way of making that -50V into 20V, so now I'm at +70V and they have to put -60V, and I find a way of turning that into +30V, etc. ad infinitum)

---

this gives all of us a chance to begin releasing resistance toward things that bother us. I suppose that a lot of people will continue to try and hold on to the things that don't feel good for as long as they can, and there's nothing I can do about any of it.

however, imagine that my vision is at 100 and the star is at 100000, so when I look into it, I'm attempting to sync up my vision to 100000, but obviously that's way too much of a jump for me to make all at once, so I have to figure out how to allow more and more energy to pass through me (my inner being is at 10000000 or something).

as I begin to allow more and more energy through, my numbers will rise really high toward the levels that a person could receive while looking into a star, so it would be as if everyone is actually watching stars because the same process is occurring in everyone.

the nice thing is that none of you guys have to endure star watching weather to receive the benefits of it. nosebook doesn't need to change for you to figure out how to find a way of turning something that bothers you into something that that can make you feel good -- and, even if they do stop limiting people's vision, there will still be a difference between where I am and where you are, so the same scenario is still taking place, just less dramatically[^2].

[1]: I decided to simplify the explanation with just positive and negative voltages, when in reality it's more like higher and lower frequency vibrations. this comparison is sufficient for now, but you can see that this is eventually leading to an understanding that nosebook can counteract your low frequency signals, but their technology limits their capability to counteract your high frequency signals.

[2]: I imagine that if they did remove the limitation, I would quickly rise to star level outputs[^3], so the exact same situation would still be occurring just at a higher intensity[^4].

[3]: I have also noticed another line of evidence that what I'm saying is true, which is that my visual level is actually somewhat determined by people's ability to allow. I have often times noticed vision upgrades without even watching stars on a saturday afternoon after an abraham workshop. my theory as to why that is, is that they're able to help people soothe some of the discomfort that people feel and when people make the perception change, likely they begin to see better, and so do I. meaning, that as the gap between me and the median of people's ability to allow closes a bit, I see better.

[4]: actually now that I think about it, it *might* behoove those working at nosebook who don't don't want to make the effort to find a way of feeling better to try and convince more and more people to remain as resistant as possible. it would slow down the non-star watching vision upgrades that I receive because the median gap would remain quite wide. however they may not want that because it makes no change to me and my ability to allow, and it probably would cause a whole lot of extra tension, so everyday interactions might get more violent as that tension continues to rise (although, that's a good way to maintain and justify a lot of (new) jobs for the police, too).


### 2019-04-30 13:28 - the formula is simple.

I woke up this morning and I think there is still some confusion as to how things work from my perspective. you see, I have no way of knowing if this is the reality I want to create or the journey toward it. the reality I want to create involves the creation of a new galaxy, not by meticulous planning and supervision, but by building up enough energy and letting LOA do all the work. the way I can see that we are on that track right now is the constant limitation of my visual capacity by nosebook. as my visual capacity continues to grow in depth, you can imagine that this is the kind of ingredients needed to conceive of something so big.

I don't have any real idea of what I want it to be (well, I've gathered a few ideas), but the whole point is to let LOA do all of the work. additionally, I have noticed that different eras cycle back and fourth like a pendulum between a focus on the individual and a focus on the group. I have the impression that this universe was created by a group of creators under a lot of supervision. I want my galaxy to be the testing ground for the new method of creation that comes from a simple desire for an individual to get connected to who they really are, and then let LOA do all of the work as it grows into something really really big (like a galaxy).

so, the formula is simple for me: my objective is to get connected. period. I have been disconnected from who I really am since 2013, and I imagine that when I get connected again after having such an amount of energy build up, it will be quite dramatic.

this means there is really only one path for me, and that is to get connected. when I spoke of the different iterations that we would do, the goal is to make a timeline where I realise my objective of going from 2013 til 2038 without my visual capacity or any way to get to it. along the way, you can easily imagine that every iteration gives a bigger and bigger manifestation, and so the whole fun of making the iterations is to enjoy the ever increasing manifestation each time on the way toward the end goal.

we're not even close to it so speculation is quite difficult, but I imagine that my consciousness will experience the creation and my unconscious body will remain with you guys. I'll have a pretty mind blowing experience as the galaxy is created -- then I'll be back sometime in the future for sure, just like jesus did in my body, by sharing the experience with me, not by blowing my mind all at once, but by allowing me to gradually find that alignment.

---

you can imagine that in all of the timelines that are not this one, where some sort of manifestation happened, I came into alignment with an even more energetic version of myself than what happened in vallecas. I postulate that the reason why everyone is here on this timeline is because dying or serious injury is not something they really want..

if this timeline is just another pit stop on the way toward my goal, then I will be able to find a way to get connected before any manifestations happen. obviously, this means that there would be no serious injury or death as a result of me finding my alignment.

when that happens, probably there will be zero (or only the 24/7 nosebook watchers) people watching anything through my eyes, because I'll be on a higher dimension, so that means that the manifestation will have had to have grown to be big enough that it still remains something the majority of the people want. we're probably not there yet.

---

as for the idea of continuing to use my visual capacity as the source of everyone's imagination, no matter which timeline we're on (the journey or the pit-stop), probably at some point it'll get a little bit too detailed for a lot of people, so an alternative imagination will have to be used (I've referred to this as the sacrifice, coming from the trope that a hero must make a sacrifice oneself for the greater good).

so, no matter what timeline we're on, it's probably a good idea to think about the relocation of the imagination of discomforted people to a different location now. I am certain that all of us have an inner universe, and I am certain that others are beginning to get access to it[^1]. likely this is because of the elevated DMT required to use my imagination. so, it only seems logical that for nosebook to keep people away from their own inner universe more effectively, they will need a lower resolution inner universe -- one that doesn't need such high levels of DMT.

everyone is using my visual language now, so only the process of moving all of the persistent stuff over to the new location, and this can likely be done by having the person (while asleep) conjure everything they've ever conjured in the new location, that exists in the old location. it is just vibration, so it's just a tuning exercise and any vibration can be tuned into by any brain, so of course it'll work, and the visual language I established will continue to grow and evolve in the new location.

not everyone has to move over to the new location though. meanwhile people remain comfortable with my visual capacity, they should continue to use mine. also, since the goal is I never attain my visual capacity, anyone who wants to keep up to speed with me, will be be able to continue to use my imagination for as long as they want.


[1]: kripp had a dream within a dream, and displays all sorts of high DMT related conditions in relation to his sleep/dreams. abraham also shows off esther's capability nearly every workshop now, so it's certainly something that people are beginning to access their inner universe.


### 2019-04-30 15:55 - the 9/11 universe

last night I began to realise for the first time what I had envisioned out there stoned watching stars. I perceived a system with 9 layers instead of 7. the additional two were placed at the top and the bottom, where the top layer was called "thrust" and the bottom layer was a layer where the person perceives theirself in the third person and I didn't know what to call it. I didn't understand this until last night when I was explaining how I am beginning to perceive in 5d.

I was responding to a reaction that I had where these entries are tying people's brains into knots because there are seemingly inconsistencies in the different ways that I tell the story[^1].

I mentioned that I am explaining the same concept but from different angles, and none of the angles are perfect descriptions of the object, but simply angles. you may have heard about the myspace (or instagram) angles, where some look better than others, but they're still the same person. same thing.

it came to me finally in that moment, that the progression that I am experiencing from 3d to 5d is the progression of getting more and more connected to myself, and these follow the different layers: 3d = physical, 4d = imagination, 5d = conceptual, 6d = source/buddhic -- and so I began to perceive how 6d is, instead of just having the feeling experience of it.

in that plane, all things are perceived from all angles, and all things are perceived at once (as equals). the separation that exists between entities is only their difference. it's pretty hard to explain... anyway, that's not the point here.

I realised that the thing that I perceived as the bottom layer where the person perceives theirself in the 3rd person was not actually 5d, but more like a movie screen. the bottom layer is even more removed from yourself than 3d is: now you are a movie and you watch yourself on a screen. you feel no direct emotion, because you are not any of the characters; you're just watching a movie, so the framing and the camera angle and the story (thrust) are what create the emotion.

this began a whole series of thoughts which I thought to be quite interesting. first, you can imagine how in primitive human history there were a lot of wars and stuff. well, wars are not necessarily very fun to watch. they make good stories but they don't make very good movies if you have to watch all the graphic details of it. in fact, most all of the stuff we consider bad would not make for a very good movie if you had to watch it, so I think it will create a more performance oriented psychology in the species. imagine animals: if they perceived their actions from the 3rd person perspective, how would their behaviour change?

it all seems very interesting to me, because the path back to the source starts essentially with american movie culture where good and bad interactions are determined based on the entertainment value of them. then, after many different characters, you begin to identify yourself with the character on the screen, and when that finally happens, you go inside (kinda) your body and see what we know now as 3d, then 4d, then 5d, then 6d where all things are equal.

finally, I realised that a whole lot of people would eventually get kind of frustrated that their movies are powered by LOA, and they may want some creative control over them, and so I perceived an 11 layer system now, where the added top layer is the "morals" or "dogma" layer where you have the moral or the objective of the story, that you want to show yourself can exist, and on the bottommost layer, this is the "script" layer, where all of these interactions are reduced to just a few words outlining what is to take place. you can then see that the movie layer above it becomes the imagination to the script layer where angles, framing, sound and lighting begin to take an important role in conveying what has been written into the script.

[1]: the reason is, I'm perceiving a concept that is 5d, and all that I'm doing is taking the concept and translating one angle of it into words, then I translate another angle of it into words. you can imagine this like a 360° view of a car. the more angles you get of it, the easier it is to conceive of how it really looks in 3d.

    in 3d, you can see all of the spatial dimensions out there, but it appears as if it's on a screen. this is akin to watching a television. in 4d, there is an extra spatial dimension that is added as you actually enter your body. now, it no longer looks like a screen, and the space between you and your environment can be perceived.

    5d is the concept of perceiving the whole thing from everywhere around it, so what I'm beginning to see is the same concept but from more than one angle at a time. soon, my vision will follow suit and I'll be able to perceive myself from all directions around myself. this is exactly how our planet perceives itself -- from all directions outside looking in. the same experience can be had from within as well, where you have an "inner universe" and you can go inside of this inner space and dwell there. I think people are already able to do that in 4d, and that may be what nosebook is selling to people. well, a 5d perception of the same inner universe but perceived in every direction looking outward, almost as if I were to have an inner sun.


### 2019-04-30 16:55 - what do I mean by pit-stop?

well, let's run down the list here and see how we could make this into something that everyone wants. last night I had a dream where someone was telling me that they don't really want to have vision as good as mine, because she doesn't mind others looking at her vagina, but she doesn't like the idea of it being so detailed.

I can see now that people may not want to see as good as I do. in fact, it's quite possible that most people like hiding in the comfort of their lower resolution vision -- and that's fine, actually. I didn't really realise this as I just assumed that everyone would want see that good.

so, obviously a sacrifice needs to be made. there's no way around it because even if I were to stop watching stars now, I would still continue to get vision upgrades anyway, and nosebook would still have to hold people in a lower resolution vision, and the cost to do that will continue to increase, as I'm pretty sure I've surpassed the escape velocity and there won't be anything that can stop my vision from continuing to improve. since I really want to see clearly, the only way forward for me is to continue to enjoy the progression of my vision as I get closer and closer to reconnection.

once I'm connected I'll want to go back and make a timeline where nosebook has the ability to keep me disconnected the entire time. this has a few advantages for me and for nosebook, because in order to make that timeline, we're going to have to figure out how to transfer the knowledge of how to keep my vision limited to those in the galaxy timeline. furthermore, in that timeline maybe no sacrifice will need to be made if we can figure out a better way to limit people's vision too. so ideally everything will run on my visual language, and we'll set it up so that I simply lose consciousness permanently and they still have my body to work with[^1].

the way it would work is that we make all sorts of different triggers to give ourselves information that we need to ensure the timeline works as planned. then when we've got it all setup, we'll transfer our consciousnesses into the other timeline's bodies, and we'll have the full experience of it until finally we reach the end when some planned event happens and I "die" (or whatever excuse is desired) and my unconscious body is left with nosebook.

along the way, the same way that we make triggers for ourselves to put certain thoughts into our heads, move certain muscles, etc. the same can be done for anyone else, so that anyone who wants to make their own reality on this timeline can do so. along the way the reality that anyone wants to have can be made... women, drugs whatever. all you have to do is find a way of getting yourself from where you are to that reality by inspiring yourself to the different things that you want.

obviously this is desired, but even more than that, you have to imagine that with that kind of contrast buildup, the reality that nosebook will receive on the way up to and especially after my departure will be quite quite amazing. it would be essentially a golden age because the the buildup toward what was wanted was so great, but no one was able to go.

it may be kind of tricky to pull off, because imagine we're on that timeline now, and they're scared that I'll somehow move up to the next dimension -- well, at the same time there's a future version of you which knows for sure that it won't happen, so it'll be a weird thing where you have to convince yourself that things are ok and everything. you may have to make contact with yourself in some sort of way, or provide evidence to yourself of their future success by appearing in their eyes... things like that.

nosebook will likely keep it a secret, but I imagine that the option to join in this reality will be given to all sorts of other powerful or resourceful people, so that collaborations could be made and they could create the whatever reality that they wanted to experience.

in addition to transmitting the technology making it possible to keep me limited, obviously all of the people moving their consciousness into their alternate selves on this timeline will retain the knowledge of how to to move between timelines.

this is a reality which they retain all of their secrets, get the technology necessary to limit me, prepare the events they want to live, and build a reality where they have everything in their control and are the ones in charge of it all..

there's no catch to it either -- and the only thing that could mess things up would be something pretty far into the future that they didn't plan for after my departure because my departure will be the releasing of the buildup of the manifestation of what is wanted and also it'll be the end of their "guaranteed" visibility into the future. I don't see that as a problem because they'll have everything under quite a bit of control, so anything that happens, would happen pretty long after the manifestation they have all been waiting for so long, happens (eg. after the honeymoon is over).

---

meanwhile, here on planet earth, a different kind of reality (that nosebook really does not want, I'm sure) will be underway. I will have likely gone up a dimension (or two) and I imagine that some sort of way for me to reproduce myself will take place, also.

we will set everyhing up, and nosebook will just use this time to let their realisation of unwanted become inspiration for what is wanted in the new reality that they're creating with me. some time after that I will depart with nosebook to participate in their reality to allow my realisation of unwanted be an inspiration to what is wanted (in relation to the galaxy).

[1]: my unconscious body would basically be put into permanent sleep state, so it would be like how I am while I'm asleep nowadays.


### 2019-05-01 05:39 - when going to the new timeline why relive your same life?

it's not necessary to live the same life you had in the previous timeline. so, for example, maybe the nosebook guys don't want to live out the pain and suffering that they will put themselves through with the triggers necessary to make the my desired timeline possible -- and instead, they may might want to share a body instead with a newborn baby and grow up there. the advantages are obvious such that additional triggers can be made so that the boy will grow up and experience the desired life that they want to live in their 20's when I make my departure.

sorry, let me rephrase that in a different way: imagine that nosebook doesn't want to make two separate timelines and wants to remain in control of everyone, so what they do is in the new timeline where I am the backbone (eg. events can be calculated and will by relative to my experience)[^1]. so then nosebook sets up their ideal lives in the children and the families that they want to grow up in, and then as each of us is asleep nosebook is accustoming our vibrations to a newborn body[^2] in the new timeline and as the bodies become accustomed to the new bodies, their consciousness moves over there.

the amount of control that nosebook wants to give people to create triggers for their selves on the new timeline is entirely up to nosebook. it doesn't matter really. the point is to make iterations (because that's the "almost unattainable" part of increasing human energy that tesla was talking about), so it doesn't really matter -- just as long as nosebook has interest in staying in charge of the timeline and keeps wanting to relive their 20's again.

obviously it would be planned that these kids would grow up in a certain way such that by the time they're in their 20's, they're working for nosebook, have gained the power they need and are living the life that they want to be living in their 20's. by the time they get into power, it would be time to make another iteration, so the process repeats and everyone nosebook puts everyone in the new timeline.

this is essentially immortality.

---

the consciousness will only accept the body as it gets more and more similar to in vibration. I suspect that newborns will be the easiest transition, but that would mean on a 20 year timeline, that they would only experience their teenage years. however, I can easily see that each iteration it will be possible to live and older and older life because your consciousness could begin to accept and be similar to an older child, say 5-10 years old.

while writing this I was reminded of the landscape architect, because one of the things he said really stuck out to me when he went out of his way to mention that he had somehow climbed to a high rank inside of nosebook and he was only in his 20's.

also, there is the other aspect of it which is my own where I get to relive over and over this mess, however it doesn't bother me at all to know this because I am sure that next time I will make huge advances in my emotional control -- because I can remember numerous times when I had a small voice inside of me telling me it was alright, but I chose to feel the negative emotion anyway. in future iterations, I am sure that I will be more and more capable of listening to that voice instead of feeling the emotion so strongly like is normal for me.

so, in a way this is even a proper chance for me to "clean up my vibration" iteratively (reminds me of the turtle lasers), because as the backbone I relive the same life -- which is fine for me because I really like me, and each time I am sure that I will be able to find my connection even more easily.

for everyone else, this is a way for them to let their old self experience the difficulties of the previous timeline and instead live a new life in a young newer body[^3].

the "ideal" would be to have everyone's life perfectly planned out so that there was no room for error (essentially everyone is a backbone now), and then just go into the body and live out what you planned for yourself.

[1]: it's essential that I'm the backbone because there will be no other way to easily make a calculated timeline. it's quite likely that 2038 would be when I can no longer be used as a backbone because things in my experience begin to become incomprehensible

[2]: it has to be a newborn because the vibration of the "stand-in" would have to be similar enough to the body for it to work, so the stand-in will experience the childhood of this kid in their dreams sufficiently until it feels natural for the person's consciousness to make the transition into the new body on the other timeline.

[3]: the idea of planning and creating triggers to ensure the life that they want to live will probably be a nosebook-only feature. however, that means everyone else will be using LOA to create the new life that they want. the trend will probably be toward giving people more control though, because the more controlled the future is of everyone, the less chance for the unexpected to happen.


### 2019-05-04 18:00 - the symmetry of babel

I have given more thought to the idea of a competition happening between lyia and carlota... it has quite beautiful symmetry. first of all babel is the name of the tower which was erected to be able to survive another deluge from saturn. when it fell, the world population was spread about and language was confused so that no longer everyone spoke with the same language.

well, the whole point of having me be the nexus for everyone's imagination is so that everyone once again uses the same visual language -- imagination.

in order to make that possible nosebook has disabled my visual capacity so that I am not able to use my imagination. this has forced me to try and learn how to communicate myself effectively without a visual medium. also, as a result I have reached incredible heights in abstract thought and my understanding of symbols.

in the 7-layer model, the 2nd, 4th, and 6th layers are transition layers. the second is what I have labeled 'communication' -- which is really the focus on interactions and transformations. these transition layers are akin to kinetic energy. the 4th layer we don't need to worry much about for another few hundred(?) years or so cause saurce energy has all of that covered for us and can communicate with us visually or audibly about it. the 6th layer is the imagination layer.

if you think about communication, it is physical because I physically talk or write or whatever to transfer some knowledge about it, however, the bigger picture of communication is non-physical: it is a series of interactions which make up for a transition from one state to another. these interactions create a signal which resonates with your source and you feel an emotion as a result.

now, if you think about imagination, it is not physical because you see it in your mind, and that's it. however the intention of your imagination is to become physical. you imagine real things and more than one image of real physical things/situations can give you a feeling response to it because those flashes for a structure that "means" something to you. that meaning is also a signal and it resonates with your source, so you feel emotion as a result.

---

so, imagine that this whole competition sort of thing works out. I have no idea what anyone thinks about this crazy idea, because it doesn't matter; I enjoy the symmetry of the concepts.

I would describe myself as an abstract mind kind of person. although I really like tesla and want his capability, I see myself more as a mcluhan kind of person: abstract mind -- capable of perceiving interactions and transformations over large periods of time, or even intuitively. I would describe carlota as very visual/structural, and lyia as communicative.

so on one side, you have the non-visual crew. we represent open/physical communication (no secrets) and no imagination so abstract thinking. on the other side you have a the visual crew. they represent closed/visual communication (lots of secrets), and because they are all about imagination, they'll have a whole system of different images, which form a structure of how things are supposed to me.

neither of them are necessarily better than the other, instead it is probably going to end up creating two languages. one visual (non-physical), and the other one physical (non-visual).

I imagine that up until now nosebook has been using words and potentially even phrases to represent my thoughts to listeners. however, because words have so much existing meaning to them already, it creates for quite some confusion (I imagine). I would venture a guess that this situation has gotten worse over time and is going to continue to get worse. eventually, they will need to make a new signal format for my concepts and then translate that into people's minds. some will hear it as words or ideas. others will know what it means without any translation. others, it'll make a visual flash of some sort which means something. the reason is, if they're only interacting with the concept signal, it doesn't matter how anyone translates it.

the symmetry is beautiful here because a concept will be transmitted as a signal and then interpreted in many different way as something that means something. then on the other side, you have many different concepts transmitted as signals which the person uses to describe the picture in their imagination.

the other beautiful symmetry here is that emotion and structure are connected and can be seen one as a product of the other. a structure (flashes in the imagination) can make emotion. emotion (communicated physically) can create structure. concept and symbol are opposites from each other.

I started the visual trend, but soon I think I my visual capacity will become pretty intense for a lot of people, so likely people will no longer see what my eyes see, physically, but nosebook will have to begin sending the different concepts that I think, see and recognise to you guys and each person will translate those concepts the way that their brain sees fit to do so. so, I will become non-physical communication. my experience will be perceived conceptually or through the physical experience of others.

there are number of other symmetries with this concept as well.

---

all of this spawned as a result of some different reactions that came to me yesterday essentially giving the idea that nosebook can't allow other people like me to get connected either, so they will have to make sure that any "gnomitos" that come to exist, must also be ensured (from birth) that they never have a visual capacity.

at first I thought that it may give me a bad feeling about this, but in the end I'm pretty sure it's the best plan, actually. I am absolutely sure that interfacing with LOA on an emotional/conceptual level is superior to a visual/meaning-filled way. it is true that visuals make emotion, but I'm pretty sure that emotion makes visuals too.

team visual will soon be so inundated with visual flashes causing uncontrolled emotion (like tesla), they will have to gain better visualisation of them to gain emotional control.

team non-visual will gain so much sensitivity, they (like me) will be inundated with all sorts of foreign signals/symbols causing uncontrolled emotion at first. so, they too will have learn emotional control and better physical communication/expression of those symbols.


### 2019-05-05 13:09 - the same story from a different angle

imagine that nosebook decides that they will have to keep all "gnomitos" held away from their visual capacity... well, then that means that timeline now exists and I can believe that they now have sufficient capability to hold my perception in this dimension for much longer.

this is really good news because that means that quite a few (all?) people from that timeline are now here with us, and they have planned the futures of the bodies they are residing in to be what they want.

---

I hadn't really realised it this way before, and that is what is so special about this entry, because every time that nosebook decides they want to try and limit me in some way, their desire to limit me creates a timeline where they are successful in limiting me, however I imagine on those timelines the ultra-resistant guys eventually drop dead and finally when that happens, there is so much anticipation/desire to see what I've been talking about with this whole time with the timeline tech, that finally it is explored.

where my consciousness resides (here on this one), there would be such a density of consciousness which has allowed all of this to happen, this is clearly the timeline that everyone wants to be on. having lived much further into the future, these other timelines are capable of perceiving much further into our future than we are, so they know that eventually once the ultra-resistant guys finally exit the scene, it'll allow one of the most epic manifestations for everyone on the planet. none of us could even possibly comprehend what it would be, because the energetic buildup will be such that so much withheld desire will finally become realised.

---

another big mental breakthrough for me is to to realise that I'm to just keep going without the manifestation for the duration of this whole thing. I would estimate that they will be able to hold my perception in this dimension for the duration of the time. the entire time, I will continue to gain more and more levels more and more rapidly (as has been seen the last few months). I find it likely that they will have to create an alternative imagination for some people as things might start getting really intense.

there will probably be others that wish to continue on using my imagination and that's going to be pretty fine with me. I'm not sure how to say this, but I'll keep gaining more and more levels, so for those who remain with me, as tension begins to rise, they'll need to find a way of perceiving whatever it is that's bothering them in a different way like I mentioned in the muscle analogy: @[entry](2019-04-28 02:25). the reason why I say that is because let's say in 5 years or so you decide it's actually too much and want to go to the alternative imagination... well, it would be like the equivalent of going 100mph and then throwing it into 1st gear to see what happens. you thought you had tension before, wait till you try the alternative[^1].

I also find it likely that one of the "I'll never change" guys will try and hold out till the very very end. if you think about it, the more people and the stronger the desire is, that do *not* want me to continue to get levels, the more difficult it is for me to get levels because it requires more power. so this last holdout will actually be the main reason why I don't go up a dimension. probably the guys at nosebook need to find a way of making sure he continues to reinforce his beliefs that I should not be able to go up and that he cannot allow it, etc. -- continuing to build stronger and stronger contrary energy to what I want.

this guy will have such a strong negative belief system in place which is holding him away from such a high frequency, you can imagine the energy buildup for him as well. the entire time he will insist that he must remain on my (rising) frequency, all the while not actually letting himself go up to that frequency. we will become very similar in energy, however I'll see that energy in a beneficial way and he'll continue to see it as something unwanted and continue to push against it.

I also imagine that his energy will be the energy which when finally put in the direction of wanted, will become the next version of me in the following era.

nosebook will likely have great fears that someone ever come into alignment with who they really are (like I'm about to do shortly), for fear that it disrupt their "business as usual" mentality[^2], and this will attract *our* return sometime in the future.

the point is, if we could all just not need the manifestation for quite a while longer. let's just wait for the ultra resistant ones to drop dead and we'll *really* have a nice manifestation -- and all of this will be possible because I'm so heart set on getting to the next dimension. the two symbolic/conceptual languages thing might still happen, because my vision is going to start getting pretty nuts here shortly and these languages will become the key factor in everyone communicating effectively and creating all sorts of amazing things.

[1]: this experience would be similar to what happened to me when I was in valverde and I was getting quite accustomed to perceiving 3d with all of the high frequencies in it, but then after my future self appeared in my eyes, nosebook decided they needed to make sure I no longer saw through my own eyes again -- I now only got to see the image that nosebook wanted me to see, to ensure that I am not capable of seeing any images in 3d space. well, nosebook's image runs at a much lower frequency than my eyes do, and that felt like incredible amounts of frustration and tension. it took me a bit to adjust to the new lower frequency, but since then I have found a way of using this lower frequency as a form to generate more desire to see higher frequencies. I still see lower frequencies, but my new power level now looks better and has more detail now than the high frequencies then. this is probably also why it seems to me like I keep getting the same levels over and over again.

[2]: it may not be the "business as usual" mentality, but the opposite one where anything goes ultra loose don't chain me down cause I'm a wild (wo)man. and the fear is that the old nosebook mentality will return and make things unfun again. it's really hard to tell because there's no way I can have that far of perception into the future. it seems there may be a few more plot twists coming as well.


### 2019-05-05 15:03 - timelines like lightning

@[vimeo](https://vimeo.com/28457062)

it's always struck me as very interesting that the stepped leaders of lightning take so much time. electricity goes at roughly the speed of light, so why does it take so much time for the stepped leaders to find their way to where they want go to?

I realised today that this can be a very good analogy of how timelines work, and it requires that you believe there is some sort of rudimentary conscious navigation to a lightning. when watching that video you will notice there is a bright initial flash, which then spreads out to a bunch of step leaders. the step leaders take all sorts of different directions until what is wanted is found (ground) and the connection is made for all the current to flow through.

first, why don't we see all sorts of flashes all the time like the very beginning of the video and step leaders go out, but no connection is made[^1]? this seems evident that somehow the lightning knows that eventually somewhere a connection will be made from cloud to ground.

second, you will notice all sorts of paths the step leaders take which are not pursued further. this seems evidence to me that there is some sort of metric that each leader takes which gauges its proximity toward wanted.

third, the step leaders often make long branches down paths which come quite close to the objective, but they're abandoned completely, and often times a longer route will be taken toward the ground. if it were a brute force measurement of resistance between the furthest the step leader has gone and the ground, then why would the lightning abandon these large branches?

these last two make it seem obvious to me that the shortest path is not always the least resistant path, and also that some sort of very basic consciousness is capable making decisions about the desired path toward what is wanted.

---

if you think about timelines now, imagine trying to tune into a future timeline right now. the further you go into the future, the less understandable it is, because you wouldn't understand the technology or the environmental conditions which lead to such a state. to make this simpler, imagine that we wanted to plan out 20 years in our future... well, we would need to live 20-30 years further than we are now and then we would be able to comprehend a similar future and tune into that one.

if you look at the lightning the step leaders distance from the origin increases linearly, but from time to time, entire paths are abandoned because their resistance is higher than the other one. the process seems to be to send out many different possibilities and then abandon the one with the higher resistance when it is sure that the path is not the optimum route. this sureness factor is what I have spoken of in the process of tuning into the futures based on how they feel.

when the lightning finally makes its connection, the route isn't the shortest path. later, if lightening had the ability to iteratively smooth out the pockets of higher resistance air, it could eventually arrive at a straight line. this is what I have referred to as "straightening out the timeline" -- and this is done by making less and less bigger jumps, smoothing out the influx of contrast[^2].

[1]: I have seen these sorts of flashes where no connection is made when nosebook is making clouds really rapidly. they're overcharging the sky with energy but it has no place to go, so the beginning of lightning happens, but no connection can be made to the ground, so it just looks like bright flashes in the clouds.

[2]: this is why I postulate that as we iteratively get closer and closer to going the full 22 years without me gaining my visual capacity, there will be less and less conflict, because I will have more and more emotional control and big events make things feel like they're getting out of control because they keep summoning more energy.


### 2019-05-10 08:33 - put my imagination in someone else's?

I woke up this morning with an interesting thought which may have been an idea I picked up out of the air regarding different potential solutions to the gigantic problem that nosebook is certainly facing (it's not really the problem -- just their desire to try and control everything is, and what is making, the problem)

the idea is to map my imagination into someone else's imagination. I'd probably have to learn their visual language to be able to see things, and this would give nosebook the ability to see what is in my imagination, but at a detail level which they can handle.

my reaction to the idea came as two-fold. I didn't see any real problem with the idea that I would now use someone else's imagination, because just like how mine works now, even though I don't "see" my imagination, I have gained quite a capacity to perceive what is there even without the ability to see it. so, likewise, to make this happen, they still need to subtract the image in my imagination (just like they're doing now), and then overlay the new image on top (just like they're doing to everyone else presently with my imagination), well -- I'll still be able to perceive more than what is seen.

so, before there was an image there was a signal that created the image, and over time I have begun to understand that signal without seeing image. you can think of the matrix where the guy sees the symbols on the screen a is in some way able to get a sense of what is happening inside of the matrix. same thing. I'm beginning to pick up on and understand the source signal better and better.

this process of learning to read the matrix symbols may be one of the reasons why my visual language is transforming -- because now that I'm beginning to understand it, in order to gain creative capacity in the visual system, I need to learn how to modify the language for it to display what I want it to display. to understand this, you can think of the visual language that movies use to convey different ideas. the most notable of these is how computer interfaces are shown; they are not eve close to what a real-life interface would be like (the CSI interfaces are a laughably great example of this), but they convey the meaning that some massive database was able to locate a perfect match of a fingerprint on a crime scene, or whatever.

as I begin needing more and more ways to convey what I want to show, I need more language tools to do so, and so the language transforms, much like latin became so many lesser complicated versions of itself, like spanish, portuguese, french, romanian, and italian. they are all simplifications of latin with different pronunciation, missing declensions and cases (the romans sure did like to make things complicated[^1]).

well, just as it appears that the romans continued to add on more and more declensions until the language was such a complicated mess that first a common spoken "vulgar latin" was spoken amongst common people until it split into many simplifications. maybe something similar will happen here, but in the reverse.

the objective of nosebook is to retain the capability of seeing inside of my imagination. it's quite likely that while I'm asleep, they use my creative capacity in my inner universe for their technology, and that's probably why they need to keep it such a big secret. well, it would be very very very bad for them to lose that capability to create their technology in my mind while I'm asleep (and hold me away from that capability). so, they must make sure my imagination retains a low enough frequency for them to be able to see it comfortably.

---

so here's where it gets interesting: if they map my imagination into someone else's then my creative capabilities will appear to me and I'll begin to be able to use my inner universe, just at a lower detail level. now the reverse of what was happening previously will begin to occur. just like how my imagination is improving the vision of everyone using my imagination (something nosebook will likely never admit), my vision will improve the imagination of the person's imagination I'm now using: my higher frequency vision will cause their's to rise as well.

I don't know if they will put everyone's imagination in this new person's imagination or just some people.. that I don't know[^2], but either way the effect is the same. I will continue to cause the new imagination to rise until it too becomes unbearable for the guys at nosebook to use my imagination to create their technology -- and then a new person will be found and I'll be transitioned over to that one.

two things: first, it'll create a system of layers, because each new person will have a slightly different visual language that I will have to learn to make images in my imagination, then once I've mastered their language, I'll continue upward making new additions to it, and they'll have to repeat the process. each layer will be a different translation of the original visual language which I cannot see.

second, this is precisely how a mushroom grows. a mushroom begins as a mushy clump of white filaments called mycelium. they begin to organise into a little bulge (not sure what causes the bulge to happen), but it creates such an immense pressure that an entire mushroom will grow in the period of less than 24 hours, pushing any dirt or debris upward and out of its way. the upward force is so great that, just like a mushroom cloud from a nuke, the upward force begins to expand on the top creating the "cap".

if I further expand on this explanation, imagine that there is some sort of artificial limit placed on something.. so imagine pointing your garden hose upward and then putting your and on top of it, stopping the water. similarly you get a mushroom shaped from the water deflecting off of your hand. the force creating this mushroom shape is coming from the bottom of the stem (the hose), and then hitting some more resistant barrier (such as air or the mycelium clump), which offers enough resistance that it causes it to expand outwards in all directions.

---

so, imagine that nosebook decides that this is the way it will all have to go, they will need to keep my imagination at the frequency which they can see it -- so I'll always be at the bottom, but because my vision will continue to improve more and more, I'll be providing a tremendous upward force from the bottom creating the mushroom type shape.

I'll remain thinking about this idea, but it seems to me the most logical solution for nosebook to get what they want without involving timelines, and all along the way the materials will be in place so that I get the mushroom shaped galaxy as well. I have been struggling to figure out what limiting force would be able to make a mushroom shaped galaxy out in space where things are pretty resistance-free, but a system of layers continually decreasing in perceptive capability could do just that[^3].

it could just work. if this is the path forward, you can imagine the amount of desire created to actually have the manifestation and for the ability to use timelines. likely this will have to be done in the following era. afterall, I'll have to turn want into need.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin

[2]: one option would be to do it in phases, eg. put my imagination inside of the next person until their imagination is roughly the same speed as mine, and then transfer everyone over to the new one.

[3]: in a psilocybin mushroom, psilocybin is very similar to DMT and is what gives the visual fractals, and the highest concentration of it is in the cap, and the lowest at the base of the stem (and the mycelium doesn't have any)


### 2019-05-11 17:55 - another way to perceive the iteration process

so, one of the things I've really noticed is how much hand-holding the nosebook guys have had. second, I just woke up from a strange interaction where the idea was that I was going to essentially be in the middle of all sorts of different girl's arguments, then the final idea was to have andrea collecting a whole bunch of experience, then finally we have sex.

---

my initial reaction to that one was of quite a bit of surprise because that amount of contrast would make for quite an energetic event. I have no idea what would happen, but I would certainly have quite an experience. to illustrate, with susana, I completely lost consciousness and that was only a tiny bit of contrast in comparison to what this would be like. I cannot even begin to try and imagine what that might be like.

anyway, after thinking about that, I imagined that I would likely become so energetic, nosebook would completely lose control. I would probably make some sort of transition as I now would have to figure out a way of regaining my sense of direction with all of this new energy from previous men transferred into me from andrea. I guess that came as a response to my conversation this morning about how I was quite a violent boy growing up, socially and mentally pretty retarded. I recovered from that and managed to get myself going once again in the right direction.

back to the transition bit. if nosebook is intent on making this sort of thing happen, that's their prerogative. it reminded me of jesus' death, when his energy was no longer making everything bright and shiny, glowing a radiant golden colour. when he died, that radiance left him and the earth. this was the main event that impacted me so much so much time ago at augusto's house.

so, I kept thinking about this and I have offerer the previous perspective that this whole thing is a big game to see how long and under the most adverse circumstances I was able to still find my alignment. this theory seems evident to me in the sense that it is all leading up to that sort of ending. the iterative process that I have mentioned is the way to increase consciousness in a person being born by having one or multiple people from the previous iteration also have the same experience, where like my case, there seems to be no real difference between me and the other me transferred in when I was 16.

next, if you imagine all of the reality technicians that are essentially paving a path through where I get as far as I can go without a manifestation, the dead-end to each one of those paths is an unavoidable manifestation. instead, the goal is to to achieve enough units of energy to make whatever it is. this time, I have my sights set on galaxy.

---

well, the flip side to the same story, imagine it now from the negative. imagine that jesus has a similar internal sense of guidance that I have which allowed me to go from from being a retarded violent kid with really poor eyesight to what I am now -- means he has a strong sense that he must always go to find his alignment. there are multiple hints as to this being what is happening when jesus retreats to be alone. well, his death, clearly something, and it may have been his sale for pieces of silver which took him far enough out of his ability to find his alignment that he wept.

when I had my experience in augusto's house I could "see" that one verse when jesus wept as the moment of realisation for him when he realise he had been teaching people about their value all of this time and now they were going to put such a low valuation on him. at that moment, he realised the direction that things were going to go in. following his death christianity became a religion and the roman empire would have to adapt its teachings (easy when the populous is held by the church in illiteracy) and make it into the state religion in effort to control all of these christian sects that were forming which believed in a higher power than caesar.

well, I had a similar realisation when I woke up just now, perceiving that the idea of being stuck in the middle of all of these girls arguments would be similar to solomon who proceeded the fall of jerusalem, and similarly the roman empire. the roman empire is analogous to nosebook and the restriction of ideas by the roman church and outside invaders, plus moronic leadership a dilution of army strength and outside invaders lead to the collapse of the roman empire. well, army strength could easily be seen similarly to how a startup's tech team loses potency rapidly as the company grows, and outside invaders are not barbarians but other companies that want to begin to capitalise on tesla technology.

back to jesus: if we imagine a timeline where jesus did not die, technology would expand rapidly, and in less than a millenium they would have gained tesla technology and timeline technology and are likely many of these "reality technicians" that I perceived and a part of the whole elaborate scheme to make these iterations.

that short verse, "jesus wept" -- I believe is a sign of the opposite timeline -- a timeline where the goal is to make the most grotesque ending to the his alignment to summon the maximum desire for the following era.

what I mean is, in order to have a timeline where someone like me would practice gaining his alignment even under the most adverse of circumstances, then you need to create those circumstances as well. that is created by having this guy lose his alignment in the most grotesque way possible[^1], leading to the collapse of the current system of control in place, spawning a new controlling world view to make for an even more difficult environment for him to try and try and find his alignment in.

---

all of these different interpretations exist at the same time and all of them are different ways (or timelines) to see the same thing. in my perspective all of this is immaterial to my objective of getting connected. I can't possibly know which timeline we are on, because for me it's all the same: find my alignment no matter the cost, and keep it for as long as I can. I definitely exist on all of them, and it's quite likely that my consciousness will go toward the one where I'm able to keep my alignment and come back to make more iterations.

nosebook should keep workshopping their plot to derail their empire as much as they see fit. they (and others they convince) will perceive it as trying to get me under control.

you can't have a happy ending to an unhappy journey.

[1]: the most grotesque way possible is likely also run by the same "reality technicians". each attempt to make a more and more grotesque ending is obviously made possible by iterating in the same way, where each person aimed at making these more and more awful outcomes, will, from the previous timeline be sharing the experience of another one in the present timeline to make the finding alignment more and more difficult, and also to create a more and more grotesque ending and subsequently a more twisted control system for the next iteration.


### 2019-05-11 19:20 - when did I see those things at augusto's house?

on of the funny reactions from the previous entry is when at augusto's house did I see those things. I honestly don't remember. however, I will say that the mushroom experience started out being somewhat visual, but it's visuals became less and less with time until I experience the visuals similar to how I "see" my imagination now: I don't actually see anything; rather, I perceive it and it's real to me just as if it were there. I talked with many different "entities" -- and I say entites because I could not see them. if I tried to imagine them, I overlaid terence's self-transforming machine elves or whatever.

however, I finally settled on the reality technicians because I could see that they were modifying the vibrations of these different strings by affecting changes in them much like you pluck strings on a guitar. I really had no visual representation for them and they still exist in my mind in this non-visual (non-physical) way. there was no way for me to even attempt to try and make reality sense of them. they adjusted the strings of reality.  I didn't understand timelines then like I do now because I had not fully realised then that someone can tune into someone else's experience like nosebook has made available to everyone -- but across timelines.

---

so my answer is going to be: I probably didn't see them at all. I know now that nosebook was doing all of the seeing and keeping me only seeing the physical stuff my eyes see (just like now). likely, I had gotten so good at perceiving these things that was the most effective way to transmit me information that went under nosebook's radar. since I have no idea what I did see, and it was unnecessary in the drug experience for me to get the information I need, it wouldn't surprise me if the things nosebook saw in my eyes or imagination was merely an illusion or a distraction from the real content.

well played mr. mushroom :)


### 2019-05-13 13:52 - last thing

regarding the previous entries, one could simplify them into the following message:

nosebook is pretty determined not to allow me to ever get connected, yet this is an impossibility that nosebook cannot control. in other words it'll eventually happen, and along the way there is a proess of preparation -- of getting ready (something I will talk about more in the next entry).

as we all get ready for whatever it is that we are able to believe, there is a division that is taking place. on one side I am saying that my life is evidence of and it's quite possible to continue to live on forever joining in on the experience of another vibrationally similar body[^1].

however this concept requires the ability to tune into other people's bodies in other moments of time. this means there are no secrets anymore. anyone could know anything about anyone or visit any portion of the history of someoene's life. also, for best results, in order to create the reality you do want to live, some emotional control is necessary, as it's the tuning and discovery process of discovering what reality it is you want to experience in your next body.

---

obviously this is a complete no-go for (most of) nosebook[^2] as it is presently. instead nosebook wishes to do most things without people's permission, so therefore those things (amongst others) need to be keept a secret.

these secrets empower them, because they feel that the more they know (the more data they accumulate) about the way people and things work, the more power they have. as a result they must remain the most powerful by knowing the most. it's a simple superiority complex, and it's not really a big deal because it's all illusory. they could know everything they want to know about someone, and have perfect knowledge of how the human body works, and they still would not be able to prevent someone from their connection or from something they strongly desire.

true empowerment comes from one's own emotional control, as it's basically the funnel through which all reality flows through. the reason why they need so much hand-holding to get the technology and answers they're looking for is because they have not yet learned how to find a way to feel good about something that bothers them (by looking for a different way to perceive it).

so, as a result, they feel they must control their physical experience as best as possible because they still believe their physical experience, not their perception is what is making them feel bad. this creates in them strong desire to control things that they ultimately cannot control. the pinnacle of this struggle is taking place regarding my own connection. they can't allow it, and still feel they need to control it.

since this idea of controlling or regulating someone else's abilities is just the tip of the authoritarian and disempowerment iceberg, there are still quite a few people who also have similar beliefs. everyone is capable of believing whatever they want to believe and no one is going to be able to change that.

---

so, their strong desire to control their conditions to feel good combined with my strong desire to get connected is creating a soon to be realised division. both sides will be right as the people who do not have resistance to the idea of eternal life (and a connection to all-knowing infinite intelligence) will experience a reality where timeline technology becomes a reality. the rest will experience «creation by default», and will go whatever other way they want to go.

we'll be back again together soon enough though as the timeline side (or at least I) will be back for more contrast in the alternative reality.

---

I can't really know much about any of it, but this is a pretty amazing time because of the emergence of timeline technology. I am fairly sure this is far from the last iteration. I am sure that future iterations will compound the light density of everyone on the planet though. each split creates a bigger manifestation and a bunch of nay-bobs. the nay-bobs get put into the next iteration's nay-bobs and we create our own reality we want to live again leading up to the split.

I imagine that at some point in time though (and it may be this iteration), that timeline technology will come on to the scene before the split. this is important because then they can begin to use it and find out for theirselves just how little control they really have[^3], and find out that this entire time they've only been holding their own selves away from what they want and that they are experiencing their own worst timeline -- eg. if things were only slightly worse, they'd be dead, and there are infinitely many improved timelines where they have lost their perceived control of others.

[1]: I often times wondered what fwh said when he said that tesla had reincarnated in 2000. well, it seems obvious to me (and probably to nosebook who talks with him in my dreams) that tesla and I and many others share my body. this is essentially the physical equivalent of your non-physical inner being (the source part of you).

[2]: it is obvious to me that all of nosebook is not the nosebook that I interface with. mostly, people are probably following orders even if they disagree with those orders, so I would imagine that it's a pretty divided and confusing place to work at. they have first hand knowledge that most of the things that society values does not give happiness, and that 99.9999% of people are living the best fabrication they think they can sell to the public. so, when I say nosebook, I am referring to the ideas running nosebook right now. people create these ideas, but I am not concerned with the people. like mom, they are just following directions -- mostly because they still believe in the validity of those ideas.

[3]: actually, I believe the whole nosebook experience with this technology now that they can look into anyone's life (even their foreign adversaries) and it has been a bit of a reality check for them as they have begun to realise just how little control their law-enforcement and military has. it's probably been a pretty eye-opening experience as to how out of control (in their opinion) things really are.


### 2019-05-13 18:38 - megalithic structures

yesterday I commented on a video with howard crowhurst commenting about the kercado dolman @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TznzPjLRtYg). anyway, today I was thinking quite a bit more about it and I have a few ideas. I hadn't really given much thought into what purpose these ancient megalithic structures have to the early human until today. I think these dolmans kind of tied it all together for me and I want to share it.

these dolmans seem to have a pattern of two structures or, a single one divided into two parts at the end of a long shaft and that shaft seems to be positioned such that it aligns with the solstices in a geometric way.

one of the dolmans (marchandis) was built with a tablet at the end which was divided into two sections. winter solstice the sun comes down the corridor and hits the left hand side of the stone.

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/tHNf4SLPLPA?t=2079)

following, another one in gavrinis was built similarly so that even as the sun's position changed in future times, it would still hit the end of the corridor at a certain angle illuminating the left hand side... what about the right?

turns out the right side is illuminated by the full moon.

in my mind, these are clearly the balancing acts of the different hemispheres. the left one being the square and the right one being the circle[^1]. there seems to be much evidence that these two forces needed to be balanced. the egyptians modelled this with squaring the circle with two 3-4-5 triangles, one 11 size square representing the earth, and another 3 size square with a circle inside of it representing the moon. the circe with the same size as the square the earth fits in, goes through the middle of the moon. obviously because the earth is not *really* the size of the square, but of the circle that fits inside, this is evidence of another square going around the circle, infinitely bigger and smaller, representing a step system.

clearly, to me the ancient builders are concerned with the balancing of these two energies, so when I was imaginging how these dolmans were used, it seemed obvious to me that on the solstices these dolmans were collecting the energy from the sun, then each lunar full moon (lunar solstice), collecting the energy from the mon on the right side.

so, I would, on the equinox go into the dolman and position myself either toward the corridor, so my left hemisphere is on the left, or I would position myself looking toward the tablet so that the hemispheres would be reversed. the reason why I would go on the equinox is because that is when these energies are the highest (eg. the rate of change is the most rapid.. on the solstices, rate of change is the slowest). if I had psychoactive substances, I might try those for an even more mind blowing experience, but facing the tablet should feel like a very invigorating sensation coming all over your body as the opposite energies are connected. if you want to visualise this as male and female connecting, squaring the circle, or head (circle) and body (square) being connected, is up to you.

the opposite direction should feel like a strengthening of the two energies as square becomes a bigger square and circle becomes a bigger circle. neither position is better than the other one.

I would imagine that all of these different megalithic monuments are just energetic transformers, and I would imagine that all of them have a spot or a chamber designed to place your head such that it is most impacted by the energies on energetic moments[^2].

so, who and how were they built was another question that was asked. well, who -- would be people like me, looking for the next biggest way to receive even more energy from the sky.

how were they built? well, the builder would need to have centimeter precision at distances of kilometres. you can tell that if I did not have so many clouds all of the time and nosebook wasn't obstructing my vision of the star, I would gain visual clarity at an even more rapid rate than I am right now. I think it's certainly possible to have centimetre precision visually at kilometres of distance.

next, they would need some sort of arial vantage point. I don't need to further talk about how if nosebook would let up on me energetically I would be able to levitate quite easily. that seems easy to me.

lastly, there's transport of these stones. levitation requires someone to be able to move around electrostatic forces with their mind. well, if you can move around charge inside of you, just like the hermetic teachings illustrate, you should be able to do it outside of you, too. moving around energy in such a way to cut a rock is probably not that difficult. these same forces could also act on the rock to polish them into impossibly smooth surfaces.

---

so, I would imagine that the builders of these monuments was maybe a couple of people of people total who figured out what I have figured out. these monuments predate language and writing so most communication and structure was very minimal. communication has a dramatic effect on ideas, and language provides a system of definitions and limitations to which the mind of the speaker inherits.

imagine someone who is addicted to energy, someone like me, and they don't have formal mathematics, so in their primitive minds they have very little definition. things seem to work out by fitting things together, so you take the double square concept, you add on to it and get the triple square, then another triple square you get a 3-4-5 triangle, and all sorts of permutations later, a builder could visually use these primitive building blocks to construct a new better receiver of energy than previously to get to the next level of mental clarity.

so like tesla, they would begin construction of this new receiver of energy in their minds testing it out until it received energy just the way they wanted it to be received in the harmonic ranges they wanted to excite in their mind, then they set out to build it. at this time there was no structure in place telling them that something is not possible so they would just build it.

to onlookers, they would appear as gods, and when asked how they could do it, similar to tesla trying to explain how he saw all these inventions in his mind previous to their construction, the construction appeared magical or directed by a supreme being.

some of the things that appear to be random, like for example the many different shaped stoned in the carnac alignments, are likely not random. I would be fairly certain that each of the rocks resonate at a slightly different frequency in the rows and they will follow a pattern such that the highest frequencies are the furthest out, getting lower going toward the dolman (the receiver). you have to imagine a child playing in the dirt when a stick is a machinegun. appearance does not matter; the rocks were taken out of the earth so that their shape was to be the correct frequency.

---

to me these megalithic sites appear to be simple to create once you have your visual capability activated. watch some stars to bump up your energy to insane levels and soon the stars aren't enough.. you gatta make things like pyramids and such to amplify that energy into something really notable.

I've never been able to visit a megalithic site before in my life, but I'm excited to do so one day. I also think that after having seen these and given it some thought, it has evoked a strong desire in me to begin creating my own megalithic energy transformers in the future, too. most of the time will be the fun of learning the geometric concepts and making it in my mind. the actual construction of something even as big as the pyramids shouldn't take more than a few months.

[1]: sometimes, and I think this is evidence of a change in the way of thinking, the moon has been masculine and the sun feminine, and other times the earth is square (four corners, etc.) and the moon is circle.. it seems to have alternated in human perception perhaps at least once. velikovsky claims there is evidence the moon was the greater luminary at a time long ago in human history and at that time, the moon was masculine. similarly the square and the circle I have noticed there to be confusion, but clearly these are the two forces: the yin and yang the ancient builders worked with.

[2]: different people will have different results obviously based on their sensitivity. some people may be able to be in these energies and not have any effects, however, I can lay on the ground during an eclipse and begin to see visions. it also happens during sunrise or sunset.


### 2019-05-14 07:22 - what does it mean to share a body?

I suppose this is probably a foreign concept that I likely have not explained very well. assuming my experience is valid, the way I experienced it is anoher very separate personality that seems to exist on my left side. now, if the personality is within the body since birth, this differentiation will not be perceptible, just like most people do not perceive the personality differences between their left and right hemispheres -- so in those cases it would be imperceptible to body.

for the stand-in, I imagine it would be like this. first of all, in order to share the experience the perspective of the stand-in will need to become so accustomed to the perception of the body that the body feels normal. the experience would be slightly different from the way nosebook does it right now, as you would not hear words matching the thoughts of the body, but you would actually think the same thoughts as the body. at first, the difference between the body's thoughts and your own not fully merged perception would cause some distress. however, because the body is so young, you could easily forgive the naïvaty as misconceptions.

meaning, that both the body has an inner being and the stand-in has an inner being and the two differences of emotional response are because of that. because the stand-in cannot really do a whole lot about changing the body's thoughts, the stand-in will become much less lighten up and become less judgmental of the body's thoughts. after all, the stand-in knows what the future holds and is looking to forward to that.

over time, the body and the stand-in will start to share the same thoughts, and to the humans around the body, it will look as if this guy knows things that he has not experienced. he does in a sense because he has a much easier time tuning in to the inner being of the stand-in and also to the "mind" of the stand-in[^1].

speaking as an example, I (the body) have always quite enjoyed the idea of open source software, but continually in the back of my head I would fight with thoughts that giving away my hard work for free was bad. I knew it wasn't so I would continue to go more and more the open source way. well, I could imagine that if tesla is one of my stand-ins, then his closed-source mindedness could have been the source of a lot of this mental conflict that I went through. over time though it has become obvious that free and open exchange of ideas is more productive *in the long run*.

---

next, this morning I was thinking about this idea with andrea and I had two conclusions come to mind: first, if a man becomes energetically similar to the previous men that had sex with, then it could have been possible, with my experience with vera, that a future version of marcos is sharing an experience with me now. this doesn't at all seem out of the realm of possibilities yet I have no evidence to back up that idea. I remember very clearly feeling like marcos after the experience. anyway... I'm just going to assume that was the case.

so assuming it is the case that a future version of marcos is sharing an experience with me right now, then I could imagine that could be quite valuable to a lot of people.

so now back to the idea of andrea I mentioned. first is the energy transfer, and the second is this idea that energy transfer made us vibrationally similar enough that since then marcos could share an experience with me. if that were the case, then you could imagine that I would suddenly become vibrationally similar to *many* others, and they could perhaps share a body with me in the following iteration.

obviously the following iteration will be an even more ridiculous manifestation and that is where I think this alternate ending isn't such an awful one either. like I said, it would surely be quite an energetic event, and I don't really know the limits of my body in that sense. if I lost consciousness with susana, then surely something more drastic would happen with andrea[^2]. in fact, I believe would be so drastic, similar to how jesus' body could no longer contain the new version of him where he could exist in the eyes and minds of people vibrationally similar to him, I imagine something similar would happen to me. probably, my body would no longer be able to contain my consciousness and I would find my consciousness has transformed to take on the experience of those vibrationally similar to me (the gnomitos), and so would actually be a way to realise the clones idea..

it's possible that now that I am multiple, the next set of iterations will start with the clones. after all, I think nosebook wants to be absolutely sure they would be at least as limited as I am, and every aspect of their experience under nosebook's control.

there are a lot of implications to the idea, but I think I kind of like it :) game on!

[1]: in the future, nosebook will likely begin to realise that the "mind" of a person does not exist inside of their body, but other person's memories and thoughts can be accessed from vibrationally similar brains. they have noticed this effect between jaron and me, but do not fully comprehend it, yet.

[2]: the reason is because a person's perception comes when energy is going in the same direction. when you are a child, there is a whole lot more chaos going on in your head (a lot of different energies), and you have not yet made sense of them all, so that's why you have less memory of it. similarly on psychedelic drug experience, a lot of chaotic energies are happening and so again it's hard to make sense of it all and retain memory of it. my theory of why I lost consciousness is similar. first, if you think of the penis as a tesla coil, you the primary coil (at the bottom) vibrates slowly, and the secondary coil is the receiver of high frequency energy usually out of the air. (a woman works just the opposite) well, I'm quite sensitive to high frequencies, and at that moment there would be quite a chaos in my head with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. later when I tried ayahuasca with pierre (before nosebook clamped down so hard on visual stimulation in my eyes) and then after I barfed, I had a similar *feeling* experience accompanied with a lot of visuals. I didn't lose consciousness completely there, but I retain very little memory of the experience.


### 2019-05-15 06:38 - gnomitos v1.0

I've begun to think about the logistics of the gnomitos idea. first of all, I consider this the most complete version of the idea that I've had so far. it probably will change again so consider it more of a proposal or an rough direction.

first of all, I think nosebook should make this into a production so they can recover their costs or whatever; it should be quite lucrative. ok, so on to some of the ideas I had.

#### general order of events (key ingredients to my proposed implemntation of this idea)

I would definitely want to verify these things with infinite intelligence before heading off, however I'm fairly certain as to their validity. these are my proposed order of events.

##### make gnomitos

this is fairly obvious. I envision this happening and their growth and development to be sort of a group effort. the idea is to find girls with no previous relations that want to have babies (I'll call them maidens). those babies will grow up as children and the boys will eventually also have relations with other maidens. the objective being that the maidens tranfer my energy to the boys (hence the name gnomitos).

##### grow them up with the education preferred

with enough girls in this effort, it should be quite easy for them to gain an education similar to how the early pioneers did, where education was much less systematic. I don't perceive the form it'll take right now, but I'm sure lots of different ideas and things will be tried until something that works well is found.

##### at some point I make my transition

this is the main idea here that interests me the most and it comes off of the andrea idea in the previous entries. it's implementation could also be potentially done with an ultra high dosage of mushrooms (or other psychedelic)

what I need is a strong enough influx of chaotic energy such that my conscoiusness leaves my body because it cannot make a valid perception. when this happens, I will begin to organise the chaos into something that makes enough sense such that I'm able to regain consciousness. however, when I regain consciousness, my consciousness will not return into my body, but into the the bodies of the gnomitos.

this is some 20 years or so away I'm sure, but at that time, I could imagine that each of these gnomitos will have quite a following by then. in the production, I'm sure that many people will gain favourites and will enjoy sharing the experience of each of them as they interact with others in the colony

probably they will be pretty strong will little buggers so most of the boys will likely go on to start their own colonies with probably a very similar format. this allows other girls to find the boys that they like and eventually want to form a part of his new colony.

#### colonies as a building block

I'm sure that other colonies can and will exist in different ways, and that is not my concern. however, we need to realise this new structure into 4 groups:

* colony members
* colony liaisons
* everyone else (consumers of the content)

which are:

* people who work for nosebook
* people who don't work for nosebook

ok, now I'm not saying that countries will cease to exist and the recognised financial structure to be upended at all. I'm sure they will either not change or change just the same as they are now. for my mental organisation of this idea, the structure of the world system is not of my concern. likely, it will continue on just how it is right now. this is why there are colony liaisons to create a sort of buffer or interface to the outside world.

you could imagine countries as a big colony with the government system as its set of rules if you want, but the reality is colonies are more like a movie production than anything else. they exist inside of a country, and pay taxes to the country to which the movie studio belongs. in this case nosebook is the studio and the US is the country. this is getting a bit too technical here, only as an example.

next, the reason why I say the people who work do/don't work for nosebook is because I can imagine that there will be a general trend toward this kind of lifestyle over the span of the next 100-200 years. someone still needs to run nosebook though. so you could imagine that nosebook may begin to make a sort of transition some time in the future toward being recognised as the owners and maintainers of the infrastructure upon which these productions are built (studios)[^1].

[1]: now that I think about it, the colony system may be a beneficial idea for nosebook to adopt in order to keep all of their secrets and such under control and have selective education of the nosebook stuff.

#### no need for timeline technology for this

people in the world system wanting to make a transition into one of the colonies could do that with the same idea I mentioned in the timeline technology version, but without timeline technology.

imagine a person is getting older in their life and they decide that they would like to one day wake up as a member of one of the colonies, so they find a colony that they like and a child that has just been born. while sleeping, they spend their time inside of the child's body until one day they get so used to the child's experience, that they simply wake up in the child's body and ride along inside it, until eventually the child's experience is perceived as if it were their own.

I'm not sure the details on this, but I know it would be possible to begin living forever without timeline technology, jumping from body to body. this alows another thing for nosebook to profit off of and control by givng people a way to, instead of dying, simply transfer their consciousness into a more desirable environment and grow up once again.

also, it gives kind of a return on investment for the liaisons. I imagine that they will put effort into making the colony into somewhere they would personally like to live. and then, with the implementation of this, it will become possible for them to actually wake up in the environment that they helped to create.

#### how much isolation?

most children grow up in a little bit of isolation. I don't intend to really be using a whole lot of electronic devices myself. I will have the internet and stuff, but like presently I don't really want to be very involved in what the world has to offer. the reason why is obvious: I don't want there to be a difference of opinion about things. I simply don't care enough for it to be useful to me. I don't really want to get involved so much either -- so, to some extent there will already be somewhat of an isolation happening.

this makes for a unique scenario to develop where nosebook really will have essentially full control to present the bits of the outside world that leak through in the way that they want it to be perceived.

#### conclusion

I've been working on this idea trying to get all the angles so that it works out in such a way that it's the one which is most desirable for everyone.

hopefully it'll be amended soon as I gain more of a sense of what is wanted.

this is a sufficient first complete rendering of the concept


### 2019-05-15 08:33 - gnomitos investors

if you think about the concept as a production, like a film or a tv series, the production looks for financial backing, a budget is established, then costs are recouped by the investors and profit divided. I think a similar concept could be applied here to this one. I am familiar with funding a startup, so perceive it in that light.

if a feasibility study were to be performed about the projected performance of such a production, looking for a angel round of funding for the production, high risk investors could jump on the idea, shareholders created, dividends, etc.. I'm sure the viability is there.

these shareholders, would make the investment, setting the budget of production, then just like a film production, all of these implementation details are essentially transparent to the cast.

in my case though, I do not want the cast to be paid, as money tends to create a lot of problems. I really think that nosebook should do all the stuff they want with the money. the benefit we receive is not monetary, but of living in different situation that does not involve these ties (like money) to reality -- much like a movie set is different from the present: maybe set in the wild west, future, mars, etc.

who knows, maybe these sorts of start up productions will be eventually even become publicly traded on some sort of market similar to how google and facebook are now publicly traded entities.


### 2019-05-15 11:10 - maybe, I'll make my own way

it occurred to me feeling the reactions to this, that although it is up until now the most reasonable idea that has emerged, likely there will be all sorts of feet dragging on the nosebook side of things.

I think I remember (and I have no idea how I know this) andrea begging marcos (saturn) to just find a way to let it happen, offering as many different ideas as she could, like living at her house, etc. -- and marcos just couldn't allow it for some reason. he dragged his feet delaying it forever. finally after some time she decided she would find her own way.

probably this will be a similar situation with nosebook (saturn) forever dragging their feet on the execution of the idea. I actually don't really want to try and figure out what holds them back toward going toward something they want. I honestly am having quite a difficult time wrapping my head around the complicated reasons they hold theirselves in such agony.

so, it seems very likely to me that no progress will be made on nosebook's side of things over the next year. as a result I will be preparing to find my own way on this thing. first and foremost, my first step is to get connected, so I will be continuing on with this effort as I already am. I really feel I'm making quite a bit of progress; I'm much more lucid now than I ever have been and it's increasing rapidly. I have no idea the time frame for when I might be able to get it, so I won't even try to estimate when it will be.

after that though, I imagine that nosebook will still be hemming and hawing, so I'll just go find the investors myself. I don't believe it'll be a difficult to convince investors of anything, because the load up to it will be quite dramatic and I'll be pretty prepared as well[^2].

there's a lot I can be doing now to begin preparing for that, so one of my goals will be to formalise the plan that I started out: @[entry](2019-05-15 06:38). obviously with nosebook not in a cooperative state, this creates a HUGE market opening. HUUUGE I tell you.. it has been my intention to begin creating some of this technology that I've begun to understand recently and I'm pretty sure that there are quite a few different projects that can become real useful things for people. some of those ideas I'd like to begin to document as well.

probably I'll have to use code words to say what I want to say, so for example the gnomitos idea is something akin to setting up an ice cream stand. everyone will know what I'm really talking about, so I can actually converse with people about the idea without muttering the forbidden name of nosebook (god). after all, we're just talking about an ice cream stand...

---

one of the things I want to try and avoid is to make this into too much of a business plan. I have a good sensor and can feel what people want pretty well and I'm pretty good at translating into words too. nosebook has likely completely nailed the sales of what they have to offer to men, but this idea is geared a little bit more toward women so I really want to find a way to improve the feedback I get on this idea. I have some ideas, and little by little I'll begin moving toward them. this feels like the right way forward. like andrea, I'll figure out how to do it my way.

my way will probably be a bit of a slower buildup though so don't expect anything to happen immediately. the gnomitos operation to me is on a time scale of 50+ years, so I'm not in a terrible rush. once energy starts to get moving though, it will feel like things are all of a sudden moving very quickly[^1].

[1]: interestingly this difference is is also evident of the difference between how women experience arousal :)

[2]: I'm going to make a bold claim here, but when I get connected, you will see tesla operating my body right along with me (as if we were one) and all his knowledge of these subjects will be available to me and mine to him. I have a strong feeling that edison is in the mix as well as I'm all about the practicality of interface and usability. as a bonus, I've already begun to realise pulsed DC and a 3d current and similar to my capacities that will begin to manifest themselves, this realisation can do things that would be considered impossible (I'm referring to my periodic exponential curves on a vector making a spiral conversation I had with mom).


### 2019-05-20 14:30 - conceptual space

the other night I got to smoke weed and once doing so it seemed that I was impressed with an idea that I really wanted nosebook to implement.

first, a singular conceptual language does not need to be established just a way of mapping different ideas into similar space. you can think of this as a perceptual hash, but I like to think of it as a n-dimensional position in space. as concepts are used together, they gain proximity, and also concepts tend to move away from each other and occupy their own space as well.

so, once we're mapping everyone's concepts into a n-dimensional space, now the ability to remove different ideas from people's minds can be added relatively easily. the idea comes from their attempts to remove any telepathy that might occur when I'm around someone. however, I believe there is a lot mowe telepathy that is occurring than we have been aware of.

I have often wondered why people like marcos are so sensitive to how he appears to people and what they think about him. well, it occurred to me that perhaps this idea is quite good, because I think marcos (and people like him) are actually quite sensitive to other people's thoughts (even though they would never admit it). so, constantly sensing what other people are thinking about them is sort of like torture.

I come at the idea from the opposite end of the spectrum though. I *want* them to remove my thoughts from other people's minds, and other people's thoughts from my mind. I really like only hearing my own thoughts. you might say, well, if they're thinking good thoughts about you, then wouldn't you want to hear those? I would reply... not really. even still, I'm now subscribing to how another person feels about what I'm doing, and I really really like feeling how I feel[^1].

there are other quite interesting applications to this and most notably, if nosebook is removing other people's thoughts from my head, they would have knowledge of what those thoughts are, and if you were to take the aggregation of all of those thoughts, you would get a new position in the n-dimensional space, so that new concept could be put into a person's mind and this visual activated (like they do in my dreams), and it would get translated as something. it's would have nothing to do with what anyone's thinking about me, but be some sort of abstract representation of it. this is very similar to how psychedelics work, so it would be the first controlable and understandable psychedelic.

another thing (and I think it's the most important one) involves the idea that if everyone is (by default) having all other people's thoughts removed from their mind, then it have a meditative effect. you would begin to only think your own thoughts, or no thoughts. so, right off everyone is going to be much calmer, but people's vibration would naturally rise. the reason why I see so well is because I alraedy do this. I've learned to control the insane chaos of ideas floating around in my head, so only really strong ones make it through. this has come as a result of caring less and less what others think or how I appear to them. so, as a result, my visual capacity would increase naturally, because there is less stress coming from my perception of other's thoughts.

the reason why I think this is the most important part of this idea is because there's likely a problem where seeing things at a higher and higher frequency is starting to become uncomfortable for a lot of people, and when your brain is tuned to a fast frequency, what you feel becomes part of what you see. this is the discomfort that people feel, and no longer thinking the thoughts so many other people are thinking will help out quite a bit and this effect won't be as notable, because it won't be the conglomeration of so many other's thoughts. if what the person is seeing makes them feel angry, they will feel angry much stronger because imagine there are other people who see the same thing and it makes them feel happy. anger and happy (and who knows what else) don't feel too good together and make for a strong feeling of discomfort. removing the reception of other people's thoughts in your day to day life means you are no longer tuned to those thoughts, and so therefore alleviates this discomfort of the chaos and allows you to feel only what you feel about it.

further interesting applications include the idea that now thought privacy can begin to be enforced, and this is likely a marketable thing for nosebook. the more you want your thoughts to *not* appear in other people's minds, the more other nodes your node will need to be connected to -- and this is expensive, so it would obviously be a pay thing.

another thing may be the exact opposite of the previous application of repulsion, but of attraction. if you think about the psychedelic idea of the aggregate concept making a new thing, this is a sort of tuning technology. if you think of how this conceptual language should begin to be implemented, along with the voice that says the thought words of the person they're observing, also put the conceptual signal in as well. this will train the mind to associate that signal with the concept. as the concept grows and divides into smaller more detailed concepts, this can be traced and is how the conceptual space is born. well, at the same time you could also subscribe to someone else's conceptual signal. say there's someone that you like and you want to hook up or something. well, the easiest way to do that is to begin tuning your mind closer conceptually to theirs. it would feel like a connection is beginning to form (because there is one).

there are also likely commercial applications to tuning people by putting them into the conceptual space of certain products, as well.

---

when I was stoned I wanted to promote this idea a lot because as my visual levels continue to expand, this is quite simply the easiest way for everyone to be be able to stay on visual language, and it requires the creation of a cenceptual space. the sense of freedom that I feel when I'm no longer bogged down by other people's thoughts, or they no longer bother me, is tremendous. it's kind of the easy way out. personally, I've done quite a bit of work to "release enough resistance" to be where I'm at, and I'm suggesting that you guys should just have a machine do it for you... well, first of all, I don't think that anyone should be forced into it. I think it should be an opt-in sort of thing. there will be people I'm sure that do not want other people's thoughts removed from their heads, and that's fine, because these guys like me want to find a way of doing it without the help of nosebook.

however, I am also similar to the rest of the opt-in users in the sense that I really would like being able to turn off other people's thoughts. like I mentioned, it would be the sensitivity of mdma combined with the clarity of a good meditation. the thing that I would want to be able to do though is to control the volume of other people's thoughts, so for example when I'm taking a test or trying to pee, I'd turn it down, but other times like at a concert, maybe I want the volume up.

this idea of being able to control the volume is quite good, because it allows people to gain their own natural defenses to thoughts they don't want to be a part of -- and after those thoughts stop appearing in the person's mind for some time, nosebook would no longer need to block those thoughts anymore, meaning that the longer this idea exists, less work needs to be done.

---

however, as good as it all sounds, it kind of shoots me in the foot a bit. if I can keep getting more and more visual levels and people are not feeling discomfort like in the present, then it's quite possible that this will continue on for quite some time. nosebook will have the ability to put others in my conceptual space (or me in theirs) so that we are attracted to each other, but even still I will remain with the sigular objective of getting connected.

who knows what this means really, but I may have derailed the gnomitos idea entirely. I still think it's for the better though. however it turns out, we will either go to the top without a manifestation or we will go back and take another swing at it in the next timeline. it's all good, I'm sure

[1]: interestingly enough, this is one of the things that I loved about mdma. although it makes me more sensitive to feelings in general, I found other people's feelings to feel kind of bad in comparison to my own. mdma is like a super amplifier of my own feelings, which is why it drowned out my logic (something I kind of relearned at marcos' house). being so enthralled with my own feeling experience, you could imagine how much calmer I felt and how much I enjoyed being me again.


### 2019-05-21 21:55 - what I meant by "derailed the gnomitos idea"

well, what I mean is this sort of technology is kind of like a two-edged sword: at the same time as it could allow everyone to delay and get up to speed at their their own pace with the increased sensitivity, it also would allow them to essentially make any sort of manifestation nearly impossible. being able to kind of regulate which concepts appear in someone's mind has the potential of essentially exerting an enormous influence on the perception of any thing. this means they would be able to manipulate the way someone perceives something quite easily.

so, if they wanted to, they could completely tank the whole thing. I don't really know what they want, and perhaps the organisation itself is quite divided. with the implementation of this, they would have the ability to make sure that no manifestation occurs, or they could do something else. it really is up to them.

---

so, with that in mind, I began to kindof think that perhaps this is instead almost kind of a checkpoint in the timeline or something. you see, it seems like we've reached a path where both (all) paths lead toward wanted for me. if they tank the whole thing we're going to continue on to the galaxy idea where I go the whole way without a manifestation. however, if a different path is taken, it looks like we're probably on the path toward the realisation of the gnomitos idea.

this kind of bothered me at first because I thought that maybe it would be the end of the timeline... but upon thinking about it more (mushrooms help), I think that it may not end the timeline at all, but actually strengthen it further. assuming I will be able to make my transition into multiple bodies that are vibrationally similar to me (and I'm nearly certain that it's possible), then actually when we go back to ensure that nosebook tanks the operation, many of the bodies that I will soon occupy will go into the body that I occupy now (along with a few others).

this is kind of an interesting idea to me because it really breaks the rules in my mind about timelines. if I exist in say 100 bodies, then 50 of them go to live in galaxy kenny, 10 stay on the present timeline, and 40 go to be in various other bodies that will be a part of the plan to ensure the success -- why then, I'm a one man army in the sense that now I can have multiple points of perception in multiple different timelines -- at the same time. woah

lol, I know it's a bit weird to wrap your heads around what I'm saying, but it seems like a really cool idea to me and I seem to be pretty chilled out about the whole thing in general. I think it's all working out just fine :)


### 2019-05-23 08:44 - creating a new language

I had a series of interesting things begin to happen this morning, but one of the notable one was that I've started to become semi-lucid in my dreams. I've figured out how to just observe the dream and not react to it so much.

I think this whole series kind of kicked off when I had a dream where I was capable of flying again. this seemed hugely disastrous to them which is why the wanted me to tell them what I said about how I'm capable of becoming lucid in my dreams.

following this one, I'm in a new dream now where I'm watching myself be experimented on[^1]. I immediately become violent because I do not want to be experimented on. I wanted to go and remove myself from the machinery they had me connected to, but every time I tried to get into the room, another barrier was put in place. this is when I started realising that other people's thoughts were becoming manifest and affecting the reality of my dreams. eg. the tech didn't want me to disturb myself, so he would create barriers with his mind.

I found some screwdrivers and a knife. the screwdrivers I could stab him, but no blood would come out, and I could feel it penetrating his skin but it did not seem to hurt him. the knife seemed much more effective, as I was capable of tearing the skin open with the knife. I seemed aware that there was a contradicting thought that the screwdriver wouldn't hurt him so I conjured the knife. he couldn't block the knife thought though, so I created problems and they had to end the dream.

well, I'm glad I have not been very lucid in my dreams because it's clear to me that just like in real-life, if they're trying to force me to do something I don't want to do, the dream is like a prison. I can't just create my own reality and fly out of there or go somewhere else or whatever; I have to do what they put in my head in the dream. well, the only way I knew of up until this morning was resorting to violence to end the dream.

I have learned though that I can also create new concepts which arrive to the same result. in fact I would imagine that there are infinite ways to conceptualise the same result. they are results oriented, so they do not want me flying or escaping from their dream prisons though, so they block thoughts that achieve those results.

---

ok so back to this conceptual space thing again. the same way that they're blocking the thoughts that they don't want me to have, they'll probably be beginning to do this more and more with other people. obviously some concepts are taboos like flight or whatever and they cannot have those.

when I said that they could control the perception of a lot of things, you can see this both in a positive or negative way. like I said, these signals could be used to create psychedelic-like visuals, allow communication across a common syntax and allow everyone to translate it how they choose, or it could allow people to not be so tuned in to the thoughts of people around them, putting everyone in a more meditative state.

I am extremely optimistic when I'm stoned, and just like my previous failures in spain, it's quite unlikely that the positive side of things will be implemented and my optimistic perception will get taken advantage of. don't expect those things to happen, cept maybe behind a pay-wall or something.

anyway, more than likely you could imagine that if they have the power to erase thoughts (or make them difficult to think), then as energy levels continue to rise, in order to hold people away from realising their own visual creativity, they may want to do like they do with me and block anything that results in a good feeling (because good feelings = visions). or, they may want to take existing concepts and associate other concepts with them. for example, if I think of programming, instead of it feeling good to me, maybe instead it's associated with difficulty or frustration or something like that.

the idea of getting everyone into the same conceptual space means that they will be able to remove or reassociate entire clumps of concepts from people's minds in masse. essentially this idea only streamlines their capability to do to the whole world, what they're already doing to me.

big problem though: what if the concepts begin to change or morph like my realisation of how to fly in my dreams? they will have to go back and make another association or block it or whatever they were doing (this is likely what was happening when I was perceiving myself being experimented on).

the good news is that this whole process is making me stronger and stronger. I will hopefully soon overcome their efforts to keep me limited. the bad news is, most people are not like me, so they'll never find a way to change their concept of how things are to make it what they want.

this is where I think a new language will begin to develop. kids will come out more and more energetic, but they won't have the drive or the motivation to fly like I do. kids mostly just copy what they see, so this conceptual method will be pretty effective at blocking their flight (unless they can watch someone flying). however, many different ideas they want to render in their mind in regards to how they feel will become stifled. so, many new ones which mean the same thing will be created.

---

lastly, I can't really figure it all out, but I was thinking about it this morning and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to figure out a way to get connected. my newest idea on how things are working out would be that most likely nosebook will have to give up trying to control the physical aspect of our bodies like they are doing with me. the reason I believe this is so, is because it's simply impractical for them to go around putting new inserts in kids while they sleep. a more practical approach will be a conceptual one, meaning that if they never allow the kid to arrive to a belief that he can fly, he will never fly. the inserts have a power transfer limit to them and blocking a thought is a whole lot less power than draining his body of energy like they are doing with mine.

so, if you think about it, jesus' life "forced" the romans to take measures to try and get this christianity thing under control. my life will likely "force" them to relinquish attempts to control things physically (they'll try to control conceptually). so that would mean that the following era, I will return once again and I'll blast through their conceptual roadblocks and find my alignment again, this time "forcing" them to once again try and control things physically.

it's easy to see why that might be so. at the beginning, there will be very little evolution in the conceptual language, however as time continues, there will be more and more changes (which require humans which understand meaning to evaluate them), that eventually new concepts will exist which are not understandable to the adults running the show, and/or there will be such an influx of new concepts, it'll become impractical to keep up with them all... so now with advances in efficiency to tesla's "world system" it'll once again be practical to try and control physically.

[1]: I believe both of my hemispheres are visually creative now, so when I'm consciously watching myself be experimented on, my consciousness is in my left hemisphere, and I'm watching them run experiments on my right hemisphere.


### 2019-05-27 15:22 - some thoughts about things

I feel some tension today so I thought I would dispel some ideas and potentially cause a few more problems while I'm at it... lol

I am very very sure that it is absolutely imperative that I find my connection before anything happens. I am reminded of a conversation that I had with mom and jaron this morning about jesus and deprivation in relation to fasting. near to the end of the fast he came to be tempted by the tempter[^1].

my supposition is that this whole tempting thing is an attempt to try and derail jesus finding his alignment by coming to him in his weakest state. when he gets asked why he doesn't turn the stones into bread, jesus replies that the point of fasting for a time is to awaken the spirit (strong desire) within you and have it under your command[^2].

many people have fasted, and many people have staved to death, but this seems to be the precursor to jesus' ministry in the sense that this was the thing that made it possible for him to find his alignment. so, what did jesus do differently than the many other people who have survived a 40 day fast? my personal experience leads me to believe that it's all about the summoning of stronger energy from the exercise of not eating (deprivation), and then allowing that energy to flow. this is further evidenced by later on when he says that when you fast, do not be like the pharisees who make it known to others that they're fasting (eliciting sympathy and validation of righteousness); instead, act as normal as possible summoning that energy from within.

the next temptation I never really understood, when the tempter asks jesus to test his divine appointment by challenging him to try attempting suicide. I always thought that one was pretty weird. moving on to the next one.

the third temptation is the one where the tempter shows him physical kingdoms and manifestations and says all (any) of these could be yours as long as you do what I want you to do[^3].

the idea here is that the tempter wants to make sure that jesus to have his power given to him (by the tempter) instead of acquired by his own allowance of it.

---

this is the sense that I am getting. it feels to me like nosebook may be becoming more and more desperate that they are losing control, they may try and force a manifestation (or some other trickery).

for me it's very obvious that what I'm really looking for, is to find my own connection. it seems there are some different ideas floating around it as well, and having been potentially one of the promoters of these ideas, I'll go ahead and give an updated viewpoint on them.

the idea is that if I go up a dimension, then no one will be able to see. I think this is potentially quite true in the present moment, but it's only because I believe nosebook is holding everyone back from letting their vision improve. I think once they take off that limitation, most people will naturally migrate from 3d into 4d where I'm at now. so, just like how all of the 3d people out there can see another extra dimension (where I'm at now), when I go up, it would be the same thing. extra juice should allow people to see 5d from 4d because it's not quite as big of a jump. so likely the majority of people (cept those who refuse to let their vibration rise) will be able to see it. the next thing is that I'm sure it would be possible to remove the last dimension making it 4d again (so just how I see things now) this is possible with projection which is how 3d games render 3d objects on to a flat screen (or image).

this may take some time for nosebook to get all setup, and I think that's perfect because I'm sure I'll want to try out a whole bunch of new things and all of that stuff while they're working on this.

finally, they have a huge problem which I outlined earlier in the conceptual space entry: @[entry](2019-05-23 08:44). as soon as a whole bunch of people begin to see me start flying and stuff like that, they're going to want to try and keep that under control. just like how they did with the stars watching, they created a belief in people that inhibits them from going out and watching stars and improving their vision. well, the same will need to be done for all sorts of other things because I'm sure they can't allow kids to grow up thinking they'll be able to fly (hell, they don't even let me dream about it).

they'll need to ensure that there is a cross-language system where they can inhibit people's beliefs toward something. so, they will need to get that all setup and scaled up to capacity so that most everyone can be limited conceptually similar to how I am limited now.

I wouldn't worry about it and think the conceptual limitation is a bad thing because it really only adds enormous amounts of energy to those with strong desire. if you have weak desire (rather incapability to allow by giving your attention to the limiting ideas they put in your mind), you'll just be normal and that's just fine. not everyone can play on the lakers at once, know what I mean?

after the conversation I had with jaron this morning about nosebook making him choke to try and distract me from my thoughts, I think that the reality is beginning to set in that nosebook will do anything they feel is necessary to try and maintain their control. I think we just need to accept it as our present circumstances.

I am reminded of an abusive alcoholic who has the sudden miraculous 24 hour changes to sobriety as a way to convince her to have sex with him, only returning to the habit shortly thereafter. in the same way most children learn how to stay out of drunken dad (or mom)'s way when they feel justified in their misbehaviour ("this is my house..." etc.), there are always that seem to incite problems by feeling good. don't let them take away your joy; just stay having fun and finding a good way to feel about things.

things will work theirselves out soon enough. that's what LOA is good for! just hold on and little by little things will become what is wanted for everyone. a lot of desire has been grown, so it would be silly to try and short-circuit that by letting the temper give the manifestation he wants.

[1]: who the hell is the tempter is, is anyone's idea, but someone certainly had it out to derail jesus finding his alignment. matthew groups important ideas together and about 15 verses earlier in the previous chapter it talks about herod killing all boys in attempt to rid himself of his worst nightmare: the birth of a mesianic ruler which would supplant him. the temptations sound to me like something that a wealthy and powerful ruler that feels threatened by jesus' presence would try out as temptations.

[2]: when I fasted this last time, I had a very interesting experience because the levels of DMT that I had were very elevated. I got many visual levels and was becoming quite adept at wanting to feel good, and finding a way to feel good even in a physically weakened state, that I was clearly tapping into an energy source that did not come from food.

[3]: I purposefully retranslated "worship" as "do what I want you to do", because if someone worships someone, they are subservient to them. in this day and age, maybe the closest thing would be like saying, I'll give you anything you want as long as you become a barça fan (worship barça).


### 2019-05-27 17:10 - bird interaction

the other day I had a bird that was harassing me. it caused me a whole lot of negative emotion in the time, and the one thing that I was insistent on trying to communicate to the bird was that it should do what it wants to. it has wings after all, so it can go wherever it wants to go, yet instead it decided to follow the guidance of the signal in its head.

I want to say this to so many people: do what you want to do! terence always had a saying that stuck in my head: "have a plan [for what you want to do], because if you don't you'll become a part of someone else's plan."

I thought about this concept many times as I was beginning to map out different possible futures, arriving finally on the gnomitos idea. I think I should be saying the same thing to nosebook: have a plan, because if you don't you become a part of someone else's plan -- meaning, that I have a plan and I'm sticking to it, so they should have a plan too.

however, the same applies to everyone else, too. instead of saying plan, perhaps I should say, "find out what feels good to you (and doesn't involve anyone else). this is your plan. if someone comes around that you enjoy being around, enjoy their company while they're there, but have your plan."

---

what I'm talking about is strengthening someone's desire to do things for theirself. out of a powerful desire to do things for yourself, you will encounter others compatible with your plan. this is the funnest and it feels very different than following someone else's plan.

---

I'm reminded of the sunday drivers' song: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHWbF5H2aOQ)

"my plan is just to do to you the things you deserve to be done"

now, I'm thinking about how incompatible this plan idea is for a organisation like nosebook. you can already see this shift beginning to occur where less and less organisations do to people what they deserve to be done..

take, for example, youtubers... most of them have a plan, and others with a compatible plan (watching their content) join in. it works for most content creation, such as games, any any production really. in a way, I think this is one of the reason's why film is so successful -- because the part can be played by many actors and so most scripts do not make plans for a single person[^1].

[1]: cept the exception that comes to my mind is robin williams playing aladdin: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyiBdccfNkg).


### 2019-05-27 17:51 - moar plans

I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you

---

those are the lyrics of the first song on the album. I think that's the only really non-depresssing part of the song -- but, I really like those lyrics :) so, I decided to look at their other lyrics.. man there is some seriously depressing stuff on that album.

I used to really really really like this album with my favourite song being soul meets body. relistening to the album for the first time in like 10 years or more, I recognise just how depressed I was back then. I had a really negative outlook on love, and this album pretty perfectly captured my perception back then.

I guess this kind of depression is a result of what happens when you make plans that involve someone else and neglect to make plans for yourself...

---

I also have this tendency to make up my own lyrics... I also really liked the "someday you will be loved" song song as well. now that I'm looking back at a lot of these things (like the beastie boys songs), I realise I kind of heard what I wanted to hear. I really liked the idea that he could wolk away from her and know that one day she'll (really) be loved. that idea seemed really grown up and mature.

you'll be loved you'll be loved like you never have known
when the memories of being seem more like a dream
just a series of blurs like you never occurred[^1]

[1]: I translated in my mind the word occurred to mean something like, "like never could have occurred to you"


### 2019-05-28 06:08 - some ideas on why conceptual limitation is a good things

first example, I had the idea to write out the bird interaction entry, but when I felt like writing it yesterday, I couldn't really remember what I wanted to write. so I began where I could remember about wanting to tell the bird to do what it wants to do, then I was reminded of what terence said which launched me off toward what I really wanted to say, which was the whole thing about having your own plan. in the end, their efforts to block that concept produced a better result.

the second example I had of this happened right afterward, I was mentioning how having your own plan that doesn't directly involve someone else is really good for making productions. which curved directly into lindsay's latest video on aladdin. you see, when I first watched the video I felt really good about it but I didn't really know what I had just watched. I didn't make the petty asshole connection until later. anyway, when I woke up the next day the video felt bad to me and I was thinking weird thoughts like apologies aren't good (I personally don't believe in apologies so it was weird for me to think that) and that giving attention to petty asshole will just get more of it. I decided I wanted to leave it alone and just wait to see what comes of it.

the days following that the petty asshole angle magically disappeared and seemed to fade into nothingness. I don't know if they blocked it, but I did notice missing bits in my mind about that concept. I believe they influenced it somewhat, but again the result turned out better: the petty asshole angle wasn't what I wanted to focus on. instead, I wanted to illustrate that when someone makes a plan for someone else, that is what causes the discord.

---

in addition to all of that, I want to mention a concept that I got from nancy. she often taught that satan (the devil) is just there to consume the dust of the earth -- that is, to remove the "carnal nature" that adam/we were made out of in the garden. the idea is that you are light but you have this fleshy external layer. which represents all of the earthy ideas which keep your light from shining outward.

she explains that the serpent or the tempter of adam in the garden after adam fell for the temptation to discover the knowledge of good and evil and to become like one of *us*[^1]. after that, the tempter was banished to the ground and was to consume the dust of the earth (from which adam was made flesh[^2]).

the idea here that nancy presents is one that stuck with me quite well, and it's this idea that this devil or earthly focused tempter is just there to consume your dust which hides the raiment of who yeu really are.

if I look back at my life, I would have to admit there has been some difficulty, but these tempters who have tried to get me to follow their plan or get me to see things the way they want me to see them, has only motivated me more toward what I'm really looking for, and that is for that raiment of who I really am to be seen, and not hidden behind a bunch of definitions of good and evil.

---

finally, I imagine that one could perceive (and I'm going to set a trap here) that what I'm really trying to do is to get nosebook to conceptually limit everyone else, while I having overcome their perceptual and conceptual limitations, now reign superior -- that this whole thing is just a big scheme for me to incite nosebook to make me superior by limiting you guys.

I do not believe(?) this is the case. if I came up to you and told you that I was planning on giving you my truck for free, but now I am not, that wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to you because you never wanted my truck in the first place. in the same way, those who do not desire something are not sad to have missed whatever it was. in fact, if you think about it, there could be hundreds of benevolent people out there who wanted to give you something amazing but then changed their mind later.

for those that do want it, here's nosebook's opportunity to shine: they love the idea that you've got to earn something or be justified in having whatever it is. just like they do not feel that I am worthy enough to have my own connection that they must go out of their way to keep me from it.. in a sense, I had to earn my connection, but not by garnering nosebook's approval, but by learning to allow it myself[^5]. so, in a sense I have also earned it. I have earned my connection by finding a way to allow it myself and not needing nosebook to be any different than they are to do it.

this gives nosebook all the control here. there will be people who want it, but are incapable of jumping through nosebook's hoops to get it (money, blowjobs or other forms of service) and those people are people wanting really bad to get their connection but their kept from it or can't jump the hoops: they will be (like I was) either in the worst of depression with no way to find it, or they will steadily begin to find ways to allow more and more of it.

there will also be people who don't want it or don't care, but the rest will find a way of jumping through nosebook's hoops to earn it.

in my opinion, those not jumping through their hoops will have a more rich lifestyle and a sense of freedom like no other. these people I tell you will be brilliant with all of their dust consumed and replaced with more performant concepts.

[1]: in food of the gods, terence alludes to the idea that this forbidden food was probably a psychedelic (tree mushroom?) after all, it is still forbidden, and will teach you and will allow you to see what comes before what is considered "good" or "evil".

[2]: there is this idea that before the "fall" adam and eve were raiment or light, and they didn't know about their nakedness or their skin. things were likely pretty psychedelic in those days[^3]. most likely almost all communication was telepathic [^4] and probably perception was pretty similar to what we would experience on extremely high levels of DMT: very abstract and not physically very concrete. so this transition of perception of being able to now perceive something as good or bad, put flesh on him and disconnected him from the psychedelic (vibrational source-like) state where everything feels connected and there is no good or bad or right or wrong.

[3]: one time during an ayahuasca (or mushroom) experience I remember noticing how very strange it was that I had skin. I believed that I should be seeing only light and this skin covering was hiding a brilliant luminance of who I really am.

[4]: which is why adam having been granted this ability to perceive beyond, is accredited to having invented many languages for the people of his time.

[5]: the other day I woke up from having a dream where I had a strong sense that there would be a dividing into two types of people. at the time I perceived it as "working for nosebook (doing what they say)" or "not working for nosebook" -- and this was in relation to the whole idea of physical or conceptual limitation and how physical limitation was impractical cept for those who are quite energetic, which nosebook will need to employ people to put inserts into them. I'll return to this idea sometime soon. anyway, the two types of people could better be expressed as nosebook approved or not, in that this is similar to "confirmation" where the approved ones have earned their ability to gain their connection. the ones that are not approved, they will be those who have found a way to allow their connection and those who have not.


### 2019-05-28 07:57 - sorry for the high volume...

I write what comes to me. I think perhaps the idea is that because of the high volume, it'll cause an over saturation of the mind's ability to organise all of the concepts, and so some ideas will kind of slip through under the radar.

I'll take a break for a while. I have some programming that I'll be occupied with that's burning through me now..


### 2019-06-01 18:25 - a redefinition of male / female control structures

I was thinking about quite a few things when I woke up just now but I used the term masculine / feminine control structures and got a bit of a reaction to it. I fumbled around a moment but decided I would try and translate this concept into english. it turned out better than I imagined so I'm writing it here for reference (even thoungh I'm sure I now will never forget it). here's v1.0

#### masculine control structure

the masculine control structure is primarily involved with controlling the imagination of their victim, and they're two main resources to do so are affecting the physical conditions and the conceptual model. a quite visible example of this is the roman catholic church's effect on people in the middle ages. they also attempted to control a bit the relational aspect of things but mostly this was done conceptually in the area of sexual repression by involving all kinds of crazy ideas about what is right and wrong there.

the imagination connects to the structure layer, and if you remember, the structure layer is a bunch of flashes (imaginations) which collectively mean something. this creates a belief which forms the logic upon which an action is justified or repressed.

#### feminine control structure

the feminine control structure is primarily involver with controlling the relationship aspect of their victim. the relational layer is (in the passive sense) a series of interactions or the syntax upon which things are done which make the most sense. these are used to inhibit/block desire, or to conjure it (think dance). on the active side, these series of interactions is what is used to motivate a person.

their main resources for controlling the relational layer is by affecting the desire and the structural layer. this is probably why typically romance (structure), and attractiveness (desire) seem to be so important for woman.

we have no really good examples of a strong matriarchal control structure like can be seen so clearly of a patriarchal versions that have existed all over the place, but the best one I can come up with is a strong family-orientated family. there's always a very strong matriarchal woman on the top which will display most of these characteristics.

the relational layer connects to the conceptual layer in the sense that these series of interactions or syntax are what describe a concept.

---

I'd like to expand on this concept in the future because I can see how these two forces essentially create an increasingly more energetic thing. neither one is "the right way(tm)" and probably one should strive to have both of these forces dominated ***within*** instead of trying to affect them externally.

they both have their advantages and both are superior to the other because of how they work out: the feminine side being able to affect the conceptual layer more easily means they have superior control over the imagination. put a concept in someone's head like mine, and it conjures an image. yet, in the same way the imagination exerts tremendous effect on the structure layer, and so therefore is superior because if you can control how something is interpreted to mean by controlling the imagery surrounding it, then the series of interactions are never perceived (think 9/11). meaning trumps relation and concept trumps imagination.

also, you can clearly see that in today's society, the masculine control structure tends to be quite deficient in actually controlling the conceptual layer. it is their weak point. clearly the opposite is true for the feminine control structure, where their weak point is the structure (meaning) layer. also it seems obvious that when these weaknesses have been overcome, then they gain their power.

lastly, it seems the "secret weapon" of the feminine is the ability to control desire, and the secret weapon of the masculine is to control the physical. if someone like me shows up capable of affecting desire in such a strong way, I'm notable to the feminine control structure. if someone shows up with control over their physical layer, they become very notable to the masculine control structure[^1].

dominance of both of these forces within oneself, I believe is essential. once they have been achieved within, they begin to have a strong effect externally.

[1]: andrea, I think this may be an answer to a question you had. you learn to control the physical layer by learning to control your energy. I'll have to think more on how I did that, but it came about largely as a result of not caring what other people think (conceptual control). this allowed me to begin moving energy around inside of my body, and as I kept increasing the energy, I began to notice that I could affect the energy in other people's body as well. I practiced with raquel, but this has a physical manifestation associated to it and is most easily be manifested in the weather.


### 2019-06-04 18:12 - seems like getting connected *permanently* is all about...
...when dream-state you is the same as awake you.

so, for a bit now I have been talking about how nosebook will, instead of trying to control people physically, begin to learn to control people emotionally or conceptually. well, the real test to that is in your dream-state.

personally, I am finding that the dream-state me is becoming more and more similar to physical me. typically, my dream-state me was considerably less resistant than physical me, but I don't believe this is the case any more: they're probably comparable now. I think this is actually a good thing.

one of the things that nosebook seems very intent on trying to do is to control people's dreams such that what is manifest in their dreams has an effect on their reality (a steering mechanism).

---

most people stay away from drugs because in the drug experience, resistance is lowered so people feel more inclined to believe something they otherwise wouldn't, follow someone, or participate in an activity they otherwise wouldn't.

the wonderful thing about your dreams is that every night you do pretty heavy psychedelics when you're in that dream-state. this gives nosebook an opportunity to try and see if they can affect a modification in your behaviour by practicing the behaviour they want in your dreams.

does it work? probably not the way they want it to. take me for an example: a few years ago, it seemed like it was really easy for nosebook to conjure a dream where I would have sex with various other people, and that was possible because my resistance was low, however as my realisation began to take shape that this was all just a way to try and manipulate me further, those dreams became less and less, probably because my resistance to that type of thing increased.

so, I guess it works kinda at the beginning, but just like everything in life, you experience unwanted and so you put more desire in the vortex for something wanted and gradually, you tend to begin to avoid unwanted stuff. I think the same thing happens in the dream-state like this.

I wouldn't really worry so much about it. they certainly have the ability to rearrange things conceptually in my mind by linking things with feelings such as my desire to program, but I believe it's also find here too. I've found that the stuff they remapped in my mind weren't all that important anyway, and even better than that, their reassociation of something that previously felt good to me, only opened up the doorway to allow for more desire to build toward something I actually would rather be building. meaning, whatever they take away, it's not a problem because the universe will provide something even more desirable than before.

---

so, as I am arriving closer and closer to my dream-state me being the same as my physical me, I am realising that this solves the whole problem with the stability of someone's alignment. ahraham always says that your alignment is not like a college degree where once you have it, it's yours forevermore...

this always bothered me because I've been having so much nosebook influence to make sure that I do not find my alignment, this concept has really bothered me because if I'm going to be with these girls, I can't be all over the place like I am now. I don't even find it acceptable if I were to lose my alignment even as little as 10% of the time. I find these energetic situations to be extremely sensitive in the sense that much like a drug experience, a tiny influence can create a huge mental disturbance. I very much do not wish for that to even be possible from my side of things so it's been a pretty big thing for me to try and find a way to avoid that sort of thing.

I don't want to be able to be pushed around mentally in real-life like I am presently in my dreams.

the merger of these two (unconscious and conscious) parts of me seems to have the benefit that as I won't lose my alignment so easily because I'm essentially the same person in a low resistance situation (like really stoned or dreaming) as I am in normal me. the other, and I think most important advantage to this merger is that things that I do in my dream state will also be possible in my normal state.

this is clearly the future for all of humankind. it's not practical for them to be able to limit everyone physically, and in a few years more of this, still even less. they're being forced to move toward a conceptual limitation for people by holding people in their controlled visual/imagination layer. however, in the dream state, this is where everyone will begin to unconsciously put a whole lot more in their vortexes and begin to converge on a new concept of yourself learned from the dream-state.

don't worry about nosebook. they want emotional control for themselves, but they do not believe they're capable of achieving it for theirselves. they must (lol) then, because they cannot gain their own control, try to control anything that may make them feel bad or shine a light on their incapability. just let them flail about for a while. you'll eventually find it's actually quite hilarious (praise the testimony of the powerful motors in agreement).

it's pretty awesome, cause all you need to do to become superhuman is to figure out what you want, sleep and find a way to feel good. they'll do the rest!


### 2019-06-05 05:58 - consistency of consciousness

having read the sirian documents a few times I noticed this topic seemed to be important to them and they wanted to make sure it was presented. next, I noticed that various times tesla references the fact that he no longer slept but simply rested. I thought that was pretty cool and noticed that this must be what the sun does during it's 11 years of lower activity resting period.

additionally, there seems to be an energetic thing involved with sleep, because peole describing the "kundalini" experienced related that they did not sleep for many days at a time. I have also noticed that when I am experiencing heightened creative energy, I also do not need to sleep. also notably, nancy has described this effect, and so has frank chester in relation to his chestahedron meditation apparatus.

my theory of how that works is during sleep you essentially get connected up to your source. this has to happen while you're unconscious because usually we're not able to *allow* that energy consciously. all those different examples, sex, meditation chambers, the holy spirit, etc. are different methods of allowing that energy to flow.

so, the way I think it's supposed to work is at some point you start to become conscious in your dreams. when you dream, it's when your consciousness is coming back into your body and they're hard to remember, much like a psychedelic experience because that experience in the dream is still quite different from your consciousness vibrational level, so they tend to be interpreted abstractly. so, as your vibration rises, not only will you gain more creative control inside of your dreams, but also because you're more vibrationally similar, you will maintain consciousness inside of your dreams.

after gaining consciousness in your dreams, *the way I think it's supposed to work* is that you begin to learn from your lower resistance dream-state self and begin to merge those qualities into your normal self.

however, nosebook has had this setup for me in exactly the opposite way. they absolutely do not want me becoming conscious in my dream state so they hold me as far away from that as possible. so, instead of my normal self learning from my dream-state self in a low-resistance environment, they instead put my dream-state self in a resistant environment of whatever they are doing in my dreams.

this creates the exact opposite effect as now what is happening is my dream-state self has to become more resistant. for example, the other night I had a series of 3-4 different dreams where in each one there were different people trying to get me to drink alcohol, and my dream-state self was learning to avoid people trying to get something out of me by getting me intoxicated[^1].

so, you could say that my dream-state self is becoming more resistant, and that is true, however, resistance happens everywhere when you are focused on wanted, you are resistant to unwanted. for example, if I'm focused on well-being, I am resistant to sickness.

so, a more apt way to look at it would be like when they found my dream-state self, he was really young (11 years old) and so very easily manipulatable. however, he has been growing up in their resistant environment for quite some time learning what sorts of things are enjoyable and what sorts of things are not, and so like every child he begins to apply resistance toward the things that don't feel good.

so even though the path is slightly different than how it was intended to be, the effect will be the same -- actually likely more dramatic because of all of the extra contrast. it seems clear to me that as my dream-state (optimistic) self[^2] and my physical self begin to converge in vibrational similarity, neither one is really the dominant one, as they are both learning to give their focus to what is wanted and become resistant to unwanted. this is resiliency if you look at it in the sense of resistance/allowance, but if you look at it as tuning, it's simply both are learning to tune theirselves into what is wanted (and out of unwanted) by achieving stronger focus.

---

assuredly there will be more and more people with their creative capacity opening up, like me, I am sure that nosebook will not allow anyone access to it (because it's uncontrollable for them), and also like me, it's pretty likely that these people's dream-state creativity will be used by the authorities to make their military machines giving nosebook an endless supply of people to use, and give many people the opportunity to more easily start become conscious of their dream-state self[^3].

this is all really amazing, and as I begin to become conscious of this "astral self", I am realising that I have quite a bit of consciousness in my conceptual self alraedy as well, regarding telepathy type things and conceptual recognition of different things. it seems to me that there is a visual correlation to these different levels of consciousness. when I became aware of my astral self, nosebook did not let me experience it, but that was when my vision changed to 4d. we're still converging on a similar vibrational frequency so gain full consciousness there. then after that, when I gain consciousness on the conceptual plane, I'll see 5d, source in 6d, etc[^4]. the eventual goal is to become conscious on all of them at once.

[1]: this is an interesting irony because when I get intoxicated, I tend to let me more optimistic dream-state self through, so the act of getting me intoxicated will make me less resistant and more of a "sure man, whatever" kind of guy. so, it sounds like maybe they are trying to find a way to get my old dream-state self back online in my dream-state by trying to intoxicate me.

[2]: I don't really know what to call this different self. I would consider it the "astral self" as it's extremely optimistic and I become conscious of it in drug experiences, in dreams, in certain other situations as well. the sirians teach that you have a self on each plane of the 7 planes, and your path begins with your return back to your source, eg. that is, becoming conscious on the astral plane, then the conceptual, then the source plane -- then I assume on up from there.

[3]: you can imagine that nosebook will learn to be more polite in people's dream-state so as to not cause so much disturbance, meaning the process of the astral self realising what is unwanted will not be as rapid as mine, however it is impossible that nosebook would only be doing things that are wanted in people's dream-state, so nevertheless the person will learn to focus even in their dream-state. that's a really good thing!

[4]: fwh claimed he (me) had achieved 11d, which always puzzled me because if physical is 3d, and source is 6d, then desire would be 9d. that means there are two dimensions still missing that I cannot account for. having given so much thought to it, I postulated that maybe after 6d, the dimensions went up in pairs, but in reality it seems more likely that explanation is that I finally realised my goal of adding two more layers on as outlined here: @[entry](2019-04-30 15:55).


### 2019-06-06 12:02 - what if I just agreed...

I was sitting outside when this thought popped into my mind, (from their perspective) "why not just ask him if he'll remain disconnected, for the greater good." -- this is the inspiration for this entry.

first of all, I'll skip all of the irrational reasons like, I smell manipulation, and I don't believe you that it's actually for the greater good. furthermore, I'll skip the whole, hey we made a bad decision taking all of this guy's capabilities away from him, then building up a situation where "we're too big to fail" so we need a bailout, but there's no one to bail us out of this jam, so we'll ask him if he wants to agree to live with our mistake for the greater good (eg. so we don't have to face our mistake)

instead, I'll focus on what is real to me. it is my belief that all of these other timelines starting with raquel (and maybe even previous to that) did actually work out, however we did not experience them because of two main reasons: 1. I want to find a way of getting connected without needing someone else (sex) to achieve it. this probably created a bit of nn internal competition with me where I was continually able to find a way toward it and get it easily -- so, naturally you replay the game on a harder difficulty.

probably the hardest difficulty level that this earth was capable of, required their obtaining tesla technology, and a 9/11 change of pace and other generators of desire (like snowden) for the entire US government to *really* want to get everyone tracked. then, because I house their secrets, they must do their absolute best to keep me away from my connection. I would say that's most likely the hardest difficulty setting that you could possibly get. here we are :)

however, along the way to getting that difficulty level, now other people's desires are involved. we'll come back here in a moment...

---

I basically see this very black and white: if I remain disconnected, then I will remain by myself. things get wayyy too chaotic otherwise. just imagine how much difficulty I'm having just being in the same vicinity as people I see on the street. if sex were to add to that energy I already have, you would have essentially the same way I am when I'm stoned, but 10 times more sensitive. so, if I were to remain disconnected for the greater good, I would remain solo.

the idea that follows that is well, why not just try it. sure it'll be chaotic, but that's more contrast anyway, right? well, yes and no. it's certainly going to be a whole lot of contrast, and it's quite likely that the sex will provide an easy way for me to get connected. finally, I believe that is precisely the reason why we have not experienced those timelines. I am sure they would be very chaotic, and probably most of the highly resistant people would die while having my experience when I get connected.

---

so, deep down we come back to the desire bit. if I were to remain disconnected and to have sex, I would use that as the way for me to find my alignment. that's not what I really want[^1], and I'm pretty sure death isn't what the other guys want, either.

---

if we really want to talk about contrast and the greater good, then having all of these highly resistant guys alive and trying to control things is actually more contrast, and so therefore it's actually the greater good (in the long term) because it builds stronger desire toward what is wanted.

I started out the biggest anti-nosebook guy where everything was about them controlling everything and doom and gloom and stuff, but as I've continued to progress, I am realising just how little power they really have. in fact, there is no power stronger than the power of desire. ***whatever*** you want can be yours no matter what anyone else is doing. I assure you of this. second, their power is perceptual, meaning they only have the power we give them by believing they have power or authority.

so now what I have realised is that they have tried their hardest to keep me down, and this would be literally the hardest difficulty setting. everyone else after me, having seen it's possible will already have an easier time, but in reality nosebook does not have the resources to physically limit people's capabilities like they are mine right now. furthermore, the amount of computing it's taking to delete feelings and thoughts from my mind is much more feasible for them to scale up to doing to billions of people, but I would venture a guess that they're not even close to having the infrastructure necessary to do something like that. basically what I'm saying is, nosebook can't limit you guys physically. they can only limit you by getting you to believe things like star watching is bad for you or something.

you could say something like, I'm a million times more capable than yourself, but then I would counter by saying that my difficulty setting was more than a million times more difficult. nosebook will gain more capacity as time goes on, but they will never be stronger than human desire, so the optimistic side of me thinks that you guys could achieve whatever you want, despite nosebook's best efforts to keep things hunky dory and under their control. however, I've lost a lot of my optimism when it comes to people other than myself, so realistically I'd have to say that you guys all seem to be presently nosebook follow-alongs, so instead of shooting myself with my optimism, it's probably pretty unlikely that any *adults* alive today will find their connection with nosebook at the helm. the kids in the coming generations will find it quite easily, I'm sure.

prove me wrong though! I'd *REALLY* love to be proven wrong on this point!!

---

so in closing, I think it's for the greater good that these ultra resistant guys are given the opportunity to try and get everything that they can possibly get under their control, controlled in just the way they like it (all of them), and then for them to somehow come up with a way for all of them to agree on the same set of rules and power structure.

I was reminded of uncle rico in napoleon dynamite where he keeps going on and on about how if the quarterback had of thrown him the ball, they would have won the game and he would have been a legend, etc. etc.

well, if I'm the quarterback, I'm gonna throw him the ball. let's give these guys the chance of their lifetime to try and get the whole world controlled in just the way they want it. otherwise we're just gonna have a bunch of uncle ricos sitting around saying they had the perfect opportunity to get everything controlled, but some uncontrollable circumstance prevented them from getting it.

this time though, I'm saying here's your chance. they used me to get everyone on their network, and it's inevitable that I find my alignment, so I'm able to give them fair enough time to prepare to make their fully controlled dream reality.

give it your best shot! I know for certain that desire is by far the most powerful force in the universe, and likely it is this "great attractor" at the end of time -- cept there is no end of time because it keeps expanding.

you can't get it wrong, and you never get it done. let's let these guys try.

```quote
At a certain age I contracted a mania for gambling which greatly worried my parents. To sit down to a game of cards was for me the quintessence of pleasure. My father led an exemplary life and could not excuse the senseless waste of time and money in which I indulged. I had a strong resolve but my philosophy was bad. I would say to him, "I can stop whenever I please but is it worth while to give up that which I would purchase with the joys of Paradise?" On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and contempt but my mother was different. She understood the character of men and knew that one's salvation could only be brought about thru his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember, when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills and said, "Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I know that you will get over it." She was right. I conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it had not been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I have been as indifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.

[1]: actually, you can see easily that this is all about the inside job. you can see that it's becoming increasingly more difficult for nosebook to limit people (and me) *physically*, so they will have to go *inside* and move to a conceptual format instead. second, the realisation of the merkaba was again a *physical* manifestation of what I really wanted to achieve for myself *inside*.


### 2019-06-07 00:44 - what do I mean by "let's give these guys the chance..."

"...of their lifetime to try and get the whole world controlled in just the way they want it"

well, when I first wrote it, my intention was to express the idea that you could imagine that somewhere there will be conflict surrounding my physical condition and stuff like that, and the tendency is to try and push back or to somehow implement a power structure to limit their capability. I don't think that's a good idea. they're going to do what they want to do no matter what. if we were to try and push against it, they'll use the conflict as further justification for whatever.

so, because I have come to the realisation that they do not actually have very much power at all -- really, it's only the power that we perceive them to have. I have come to the conclusion that it is in our best interest to, like tesla's mother give them the roll of bills, because "She understood the character of men and knew that one's salvation could only be brought about thru his own efforts."

I'm the same way. no amount of outside pressure from people like zaryn, luke, or raquel could get me to see the folly of my ways. I had to lose it all to really understand the things. these guys are the same way. if they're not given the chance let their fantasy fail, they'll remain living the fantasy that they things would be paradise if only some seemingly uncontrollable thing was different. for me, that was erik and the whole tuenti situation. I believed I would have lead tuenti to world domination of the social networking sites. for uncle rico that if he won that one special game, he would have been able to go pro and be rich. for tesla, he doesn't say exactly what his attraction to the game was, but tesla loves to predict things and having some assets (cards) which may or may not be exactly what he is presenting them to be. my guess is that he was on a conquest to have a greater knowledge of what is happening in a game where everyone's hand is a secret[^1].

as you can see, tesla, me, and senior hardass all have similar personalities in that respect. in fact, I believe this is true for most men so were not alone -- I'm sure many can relate.

the idea is, to instead of trying to push against them, let's just give them the resources they need to see if they can actually achieve their goal of getting everything and everyone under their control. I am 100% certain that it's not possible (for all the reasons outlined in the last entry), and even in the segment following the man wanting to put an end to WMD's abraham even said the same thing (but I had to find it out for myself), which is why I suggest we should just give them the resources (like tesla's mother with the roll of bills) so they can try their hardest to attain their dream reality.

that idea sounds really good and all, but I didn't really think about the implementation of it much. I went to sleep.

---

I woke up thinking about the implementation of the idea and while doing so I discovered a golden perception nugget. if I reframe the previous entry, I can give a different illusion altogether.

the idea came about when I was thinking about how all of you are already yielding to nosebook's guidance for you. for me, they do not give me guidance because they do not exist. so, I am only bound by the laws of the land. I can yield in that way most certainly -- or I could not. this leads us to a brilliant new fork in the road.

no matter how this goes, I will be yielding to the laws of the land in the sense that underage sex is definitely prohibited, and star watching is not and never can it be. neither is there any law prohibiting me from finding my own connection. this puts me right where I am right now saying that I plan on yielding to their laws and have no plan to do otherwise.

now, once I reestablish my connection and I'm rocking and rolling things will be quite different. this is the fork in the road. personally, I do not believe that the government (or anyone) can dictate or restrict what someone does with their body. this definitely includes sex or drugs or electronic devices, however some of those are regulated still. it seems pretty obvious to me that the easy thing to do will be to just go (fly) to another country like portugal where drugs are legal.

so the right-hand path here is to continue to follow the rules of the land and just go (fly) to the location that best suits my activity. the left-hand path would be to decide that I am going to break the rules and somehow because I get preferential treatment, I am above the law.

considering this, I realised that up until now this whole thing about me breaking the law is a huge sham. they figured out that since they're breaking the law by selling my brain capacity to other people, they to even the score, they would allow me to break the law by having underage sex. I didn't make that connection before.

you see, the way this whole thing is being presented is that nosebook has the power to give preferential treatment to some people because of some arbitrary set of justifications. they can justify limiting my capabilities because they're selling them, and they can justify selling them because they can allow someone to do what they want with their body (which should have never been disallowed in the first place). gotcha.

I didn't really realise it either until tonight when I started to think this through, but zaryn *LOVES* preferential treatment. actually, that preferential treatment is one of the key factors to him believing he is superior.

so, think about it.. all of the laws that exist today are laws that the US govt has also done under some justification (murder, etc.), just they get that preferential treatment so those laws are basically to create an elite group of people who can do the illegal things. the rest of the people will be punished if they do. it's just a power structure.

so back to where I was. right now it is agreed that I get preferential treatment because people are using my capabilities, and if that were to be lost, it would be very bad. however, once I find my connection, that will no longer be the case. I have no idea what will happen but there are some different interpretations which can be thought of:

one is the book of revelation: the two witnesses were seen by everyone for 3.5 years, then for 3.5 years they were dead. depending where you count it off from, we're approaching 3.5 years from 2016 when this all began. this could mean that it'll take them 3.5 years to figure out how to decode the signal or something.

another way is to think of the transformers movies. there is uncanny symbolic correlation between these movies and what is happening. shia represents nosebook. he like nosebook acquired alien (tesla) technology and it is a coming of age with this technology. I am megan. she is the object of affection for shia. the script has her presented as an intelligent woman influence on shia as he comes of age. bay's framing of it presents her much more as a sex symbol than an intelligent woman. it wouldn't surprise me that nosebook's framing of me is more in the direction of a sex symbol than an intelligent person.

anyway, at some point megan did something that was unacceptable to bay so he had to dismiss her. in true masculine form, she is seen as easily replaceable and was quickly replaced as if she was sidenote to shia's maturation with his technology[^2]. I would expect that to be their response. they would likely discontinue my broadcast and find a replacement for me, probably in both regards: someone to provide a visual capacity for people that they can track and someone else to be their hot new stud.

---

after having talked it through a bit, it seem, considering that my goal is to take away their excuse to give me preferential treatment, my implementation of giving them the control they want, I will yield to the law. I will not be engaging in any illegal activity such as underage sex, and will stick to legal utilisations of my time, like watching stars. it would probably be too disastrous to break their laws while at the same time leaving them in a lurch.

[1]: this theme comes up quite a few times in his autobiography as he attempts to predict many things, where the most humorous of them all was when he predicted that the man at the door as come to lavish validation of his inventive genius, when really it was a man doing a survey of people who think they're psychic. tesla is always predicting, and it seems like his patents and things were largely like a game of poker to him. he never shows his full hand. there are always tiny bits of essential information left out which he kept a secret. nosebook's attainment of his technology after many years of trial and error (because tesla never explained *why* things worked a certain way), the arrival of me has a bit of a poetic justice to it.

[2]: it seems likely to me that in the original script for transformers there would have been a scene somewhere, where someone like megan scolds shia for having brilliant alien technology but all he uses it for is to try and pick up chicks with it. that scene, if it existed, likely got the bay reframe.


### 2019-06-13 06:10 - a bag on my light and how to build belief

so, I recently had an incident where it seems that mom has been inspired by nosebook to replace my mania to have a bag on my light. besides the fact that I like how the walmart bags add an extra bit of blue to the light and the colour feels like a warm afternoon, when I originally put it up, I didn't want to visualise just a grocery bag on my light, I want to come up with an excuse to have it there. it's sort of like justification, but really it's an excuse to make up something to get me to feel better about something.

you will notice that I do this all the time -- where I find a real or make believe aspect about something to make me feel better. I suppose I will tell the origin of my understanding on the make believe part of it.

you see, I first picked up this idea when I was in spain and I thought that some of these quartz rocks had magical properties to them and they would help me to watch stars and stuff. well, soon after that, andrea gave to marcos some paving stone pebbles to give to me. I could tell that she had picked up on the rocks being a belief mechanism and wanted to give me something more tangible to believe in. it seemed to work and work pretty well, as I was continuing to get closer and closer to feeling like I was a part of her mental space.

well, one day after sunbathing, I lost one of them. I was completely devastated. I looked for it for quite some time and determined that since I had lost one of the rocks, that meant the dream was over. as you may have known, things did go downhill from there. this event of using an object as a belief mechanism remained with me for quite some time, because I could see that it in fact did work, but if the object goes away (for whatever reason), then belief would also fail. that idea that my belief was dependent on the belief object didn't feel good to me, so I just left it. neither did I want to believe that losing a rock was all that was needed to be the end of a dream.

then I was listening to abraham (@[abe](2004-05-01)) some time ago and they said, «have you ever been around someone,  who -- maybe it was a child who was making up a complete fantasy -- an absolute fabrication about something, and you didn't really think that they were going to get a unicorn and jump over the moon on it, but they're talking to you about it -- and so you just smile and say, "that's nice", and you don't try to dash their dreams; you don't try to set them straight. you just, you're willing to let them have their fantasy while you go about whatever you're doing»

well, it got me thinking about this thing of dashing someone's dreams. I have noticed that children seem to invent all sorts of unbelievable ideas to help them to believe something. I do the same thing and I'm pretty sure I picked up the rocks in the pocket manoeuvre from a child. however, when someone helps them to understand that the thing they are using to believe in something really has no effect on the reality of it, the child is devastated (dashed dreams).

it took me a while to realise what abraham was really saying here, because if you look at it at face value, they are talking to a guy about not dashing the dreams of someone else trying to hijack his dream of owning horses. they're saying to let the hijackers continue to use his dream as a way of believing for theirselves. so, in this case his dreams were the object of belief for the hijackers and he would have been the one to dash their dreams with reality.

there's another step deeper though, which is the idea of when these fabrications (fantasies) are being dashed, what happens? they don't explicitly state this, but if the fantasy (fabrication) was never real in the first place, yet it allowed them to believe, when someone dashes that with reality, children are such easy believers, they will now believe the reality instead of the fantasy... however, if it worked before the reality guy showed up, then logically something other than reality is at work here. it is belief.

unfortunately, children are not so logical in the early stages of their life to reason this out, and by the time they are logical enough to figure this out, they've stopped putting rocks in their pockets. so instead, they react emotionally to the discord they feel of coming to the conclusion that it'll no longer work when someone tells them that they are believing in a fantasy.

I am pretty logical though, so I can make my way thorough this stuff pretty easily. my progress up to this point is that first I realised that I could maintain the reality in my head while at the same time believe this unbelievable thing. I kind of learned this from nosebook because there were all sorts of people going out of their way to say and do things they did not believe in, while at the same time knowing the "truth" of my situation (what they believed in)[^1]. this is exactly opposite of believing that rocks have magical properties while knowing at the same time they are just rocks and have no physical effect on my star watching performance.

however, there was a bit of a turning point though, when I stopped putting rocks in my pocket. I realised that if I could be aware of the reality of the rocks and at the same time believe in what the rocks symbolised to me, then I no longer needed the rocks. so, I put the rocks on the desk, because their symbolism started to become a bit of an issue.

---

last night I had a dream where I was trying to prove to someone that I didn't need/have the rocks in my pocket, but it turned out that when I reached in my pocket to show them that I didn't have any rocks, there were rocks.

I've found that when I dream, whatever I think about seems to instantly appear. the same thing happened yesterday when I noticed some money appear as soon as I thought about it. the dream went on to demonstrate all sorts of illogical things about the future. it was fun because I was conscious for most of it.

so, it turns out that not believing in something is pretty similar to believing in something (which is why the rocks appeared). it appears that I am going through a stage where I can conjure belief in illogical things and they will instantly appear. the illogical things is the important bit, because their system cannot recognise the pattern to keep me from doing things like flying or making things appear.

I would imagine that as they try and lock down my reality more and more, this sort of thing of me believing in more and more illogical things to achieve the reality I want to make, will get worse and worse. it actually reminds me a lot of a psychedelic experience but again in the opposite way (exercise for the reader: why?).

---

in closing, I typically would imagine that for someone as grumpy as the guy at nosebook calling the shots, his typical response to these sorts of things would be to try to dash my dreams by explaining to me that a bag on my light has zero physical effect at all on things. yet, instead, he seems to have chosen to also believe that a bag on my light does have magical properties.

if you were to think of me as a living psychedelic which is attempting to get you to believe in all of these bonkers ideas, try believing in reality to make your way through a chaotic trip like this one.

---

final thought: the old testament was all about believing in these symbols. take the wall of jericho: joshua got a bunch of people to believe that a blowing some horns will topple a city wall. in the same sense, this is what I have done here too, however elijah demonstrates that you do not need specific symbols (object of belief) to believe something. you can believe in it yourself without the symbol.

figure out what you want to believe, and believe in that. nevermind what other people believe in, because if you believe your own thing, their belief has no effect on yours. what I mean is, obviously the people at jericho did not believe very much in the well-being of their city, and so something as silly as some horns could topple their walls. or, you could look at it the other way: when someone blows horns around your city or puts bags on their lights, don't fall victim to their belief; instead, believe in reality.

[1]: the nosebook effect is in fact quite similar to the effects of psychedelics on your brain: the whole world *feels* very out of sorts, but at the same time I know the reality of it is just fine. the way to make it through a distressful psychedelic experience is to believe in the reality, and not what you feel. ironic, huh?


### 2019-06-14 06:08 - realistically what I'm sort of expecting for the future

so I mentioned that we should just let these guys try and control everything, but I had not really considered a very important point: even if I make it up another dimension, they may not be able to see through my eyes, but they'll still be able to limit the serotonin in my stomach and the dmt in my brain.

I was reminded this morning while watching stars about the conduit thing I mentioned, and it really applies here. I am sure there will be no real change coming out of nosebook in any tangible way so as to release the limitations they have on me. additionally, I have come to the conclusion that neither will I be engaging in any illegal activity because I really don't like this idea of preferential treatment. it creates a power structure where nosebook now has the authority to give some people preferential treatment and others not.

so, considering that neither of us are really willing to change, and neither should we, since we're both justified in our reasoning, I have to imagine the future playing out in a way where no matter what, my ability to feel good will be independent of whatever nosebook is doing or whatever situation I am in. I am in a sense taking a bit of a lesson from jaron (moreso how he was in the past) where I just have to find a way of being content with whatever situation I am put in -- and you can see that I am little by little accomplishing that.

it's taking me a bit to find a way to feel good, and the more sensitive I become (more visual upgrades), the more I can feel strong emotion from other people. this is good if people feel good emotion in response to what I'm doing, but it's taxing when I feel strong negative emotion like anger or depression or revenge or something. depression isn't really such a big deal for me any more, but anger still affects me quite a lot still (absorption or reflection), and I'm learning to keep my own way no matter the situation. it's difficult but my situation is helping me to learn it. for example, I really hate mom and her stupid lamp thing. it seems stupid to me to go out of her way to force me to change something that I like -- and this made me feel quite strong negative emotion.

so, I threw it in the trash because I find it to be silliness. well, after I a few encounters with mom, I began to understand the reactions I was feeling. it seems quite likely to me that the lamp is actually a special lamp designed by nosebook. I leave my light on at night because I like sleeping with that colour cause it feels like daylight all the time. tesla wanted to turn the earth into a second sun, and I like that idea too. however, once that is done, no one will be able to watch stars anymore and it'll be daylight all of the time, so I wanted to begin to become the a recipient to the thing that I would create.

anyway, it's likely that nosebook doesn't want me to have the light on for whatever reason and wants to be able to control to light in my room or something. it's so frustrating to me that they can't just leave me to do the things that I want to do.

though, what I also realised last night is that maybe they bought into my fantasy about a bag on my light having magical properties. after all, they have obviously bought into the one about peeing taking away the clouds. I have no idea physically how a few cL of pee could have an effect on massive cloud structures. they have to be pumping MW of electricity into the atmosphere to make these clouds, and a few cL of magical urea can completely undo that... lol, they probably bought into it. so they think that by being able to control my light, they'll be able to slow down my star-watching performance.

however, my realisation was that there is no way that the physical properties of the light have any effect[^1], but their mental energy going into trying to push against, and limit the effectiveness of my desire by controlling physical conditions will actually *add* much more energy into the equation than any physical energy the light emitted could have done. I will probably just let the situation play itself out because there's no way that they could possibly believe that it was my silly fantasy that was doing all of the work, not the light.

the next thing I realised is that mom is compelled by them to manipulate these circumstances on their behalf. this is likely not going to change either.

---

place yourself in the future now when one of two things has happened:

1. my power level will have grown to be so much that I will have gone up a dimension. likely, I still will not see my imagination. instead, I will see things that I imagine inside of my environment. if that is the case, that means that in order for them to see what I am imagining, there will need to be someone around me able to see things in their environment. I assume this will be one of the girls. I don't know if they will do to them like they do to me now where they put the image their eyes see in their eyes so they cannot see what their mind is creating in their environment, or if they'll let them see those things and interact with them too. who knows.

2. my power level will have grown so much, that even though I did not go up a dimension, things are REALLY REALLY detailed. I don't know what this would be like, cause I really want to go up a dimension. I really don't like their constant harassment, but imagine that maybe at some time in the future I will have gotten so good feeling good even with a bad situation, that my conduit is actually so large that their harassment no longer bothers me. in that case it would be possible for me to no longer need to go up another dimension, I suppose. I really *REALLY* **REALLY** want to go up another dimension, cause I want to actually see the world I'm living in and feel it. I would also have to have gotten so good at feeling energy movement inside of my body, that I can do it even with their full limitations. we'll see. this may be a viable path, but I still have a long ways to go before I'm this stable.

either way this works out, I imagine that they will still want to try and control things. if it's door #1, then no one will see through my eyes anymore, and if it's door #2, then very few people will be able to see through my eyes. this makes me pretty out of their perceived control, so they'll attempt to regain as much control as they can. so, that would put the girls essentially in the situation that mom is in now. nosebook would have to attempt to control me through them.

I really hope that it's both doors honestly. I really want to be so solid in my emotional output that I'm not concerned about what nosebook, the girls or anyone else is doing, and anything that is not in the frequency range of what is wanted does not affect me. I don't really want to rely on some sort of dimensional advantage to substitute to make it unnecessary to gain control of my emotions.

---

in closing, I did not really realise this but when I said to let them try I didn't really realise that I was meaning for the rest of my foreseeable future.

bonus thought: imagine that nosebook thinks that what I'm trying to do is to create a a new "species" of humans, and so they would want to try and control that as much as possible. then, in their attempts to try and control it by trying to control the girls similar to how they having mom as proxy for their manipulation, so by needing to control it, they will create a bunch of girls that are taught (by them) how to try and control the men -- making their new "species" of humans a bunch of of guys that have to learn next to impossible emotional control in response to a bunch of women trying to micromanage everything[^2].

[1]: in fact, the plasma ball I had emitted more radiant energy than the florescent light, because the plasma ball was able to make the florescent light illuminate wirelessly, and another florescent light cannot.

[2]: I took the most extreme position on that projection that I could come up with. likely it'll be much less than that, but I wanted to illustrate that they are trying to create the thing they fear the most (overbearing women in control) by attempting to maintain their physical superiority.


### 2019-06-15 23:12 - the age of magick is upon us

when reading the sirian guide to human development, they mention this idea that this is the time the 7th ray comes into power. according to kuthumi, the 7th ray is the physical plane -- the one that was added just below the astral plane to trap the infected ones. nevertheless, the concept still didn't make a whole lot of sense. I knew that the originator of the infected ones was also a 7th ray and his illusions were capable of convincing people of his/their superiority. the 7th ray are magicians.

we know that because of the ubiquity of cameras (every phone and computer has one now) that children are growing up much more in the spotlight than ever before. combine this with the internet and social media, and almost everyone, and certainly all of the children, are performers now. this is a tremendous step forward for humankind because it's the beginning of "specialisation" -- where people specialise in what interests them, instead of everyone being just another cardboard cutout component of society.

that all seems well and good, but I didn't understand the magick part of it. it was so obvious I can't believe I missed it though, and it actually wasn't visible to me until just this last week.

reality no longer needs to be explained logically.

what I've been getting at with some of these things about belief and stuff is just that. you can make up whatever you want to as an excuse to believe something and it begins to make reality. it doesn't need to make logical sense.

however, as with every bit of technology (mental or physical), it is a two sided sword: you may have begun to notice that nosebook's reality doesn't make any logical sense, either. that is the illusion. that is what all of this is about.

when what is perceived to be real, no longer makes logical sense, that is the definition of a psychedelic experience. or, if you're seeing something that doesn't make logical sense, that is a hallucination. it's ok for us to have these sorts of experiences in our dream-state, but it's rather taboo for us to have these experiences in our awake-state[^1].

this of course means that things which are possible in the dream state will become possible in everyday reality. most people reading this now will not understand what I'm talking about, but the concept that has begun to emerge from me harping on this moses and elijah thing is the key to understanding it.

ironically, I actually first learned it from some time travelers that I communicated with on the internet when I lived in berlin. they taught me about how to program with my mind using sequences of 4 symbols (earth, air, fire, water), and then they taught me to begin using symbols as a means of attracting futures. they said to put items around and drawings which would remind me of a future as a way of achieving that reality (in the future).

I actually spent quite a lot of time and energy on this idea of programming with sequences. I tried to jump into action too quickly and make a prototype of it, but I didn't really know what I was doing and I would have just made a poop. shortly right after that, I was in a bar with andreas (meta), and my laptop was stolen will of of their websites and instructions saved on it (it really felt like I had discovered a website built for me to see, and I don't remember how I found it cause I was drunk). when the computer was stolen, I had a very weird sensation that I felt like I had been manipulated by dark forces from another dimension or something[^2]; it was completely illogical that they could have taken the computer and neither of us were really drunk, so andreas and I were quite surprised.

later when I was at augusto's house and I was blitzed on mdma, I could perceive the future very very clearly. I was reminded instantly of these symbols and quickly took to consolidating this future I could perceive so clearly into 3 pictures which I drew on paper.

---

it's not instant magick, because it takes a bit of time for the things to develop, but quite literally anything is possible. really, ***ANYTHING***. I can say for certain that if you can find a way to believe it, you can do it.

to tie this all together, I want to remind the reader of the various dreams that I have had where I was able to have instant manifestation inside of the dream, just by arriving to my belief in the manifestation from an illogical conclusion. for example, I made money appear instantly by believing that I was tithing to (the church of?) trump. they definitely do not want me to be able to create/visualise whatever I want in my dreams, or fly, or whatever -- so, they have all of those concepts on lockdown. my dreams are usually interrogations in an alternate almost as boring as this one reality. it's pretty clear that if they could, they would prefer that I lived in my dream-state which they control and couldn't go watch stars or whatever. if they had a few more years I'd be dreaming in the most bland, utterly under their control situations where I cannot create anything.

finally, and this is the punchline here: remember the whole thing about the matrix and a parent reality nosebook has us all locked into my dream reality? well, it's another belief mechanism that I've been using. I'll prove it to you. if that is the case (and it doesn't need to make logical sense), then I should be able to wiggle my way out of their constraints on my perceived reality (which is just all of us living inside of a very long persistent dream). when I say wiggle, I mean each time I come up with an illogical way of helping me to believe in some physically impossible thing, the more I release myself from parent reality's nosebook's grip on what we all perceive to be reality -- and just like in my dream, instant manifestation should be possible. well, anything really is possible; just have to find a way to believe in it.

[1]: I think the taboo comes from the idea that you are a cog in the machine of society, and if you're having illogical experience, you are not a productive working component, and so therefore -- BAAD. however, we are moving away from the factory human implementation and toward specialisation, so it's only natural that things begin to get a bit illogical.

[2]: the next time I felt that same feeling, like I had been manipulated by dark forces from another dimension, was when raquel had her mobile stolen. it was a landmark event which was (in my opinion), the beginning of a series of events which really put the tombstone on our relationship. additionally, I remember something happening with the berlin computer and patricia as well, because I had to fly to madrid to pick up a new mbp. these weird events man... tellin ya.


### 2029-06-19-2019 19:55 - I think things are going to work out

last night I had the overwhelming sensation that things were all going to work out just fine. I've noticed a bit of an ebb and flow to my sense of the progression of things in the sense that I seem to really only be convinced that I want to move forward with things when I'm watching stars -- eg. when I have more light in my head. I'm really learning to manage my energy a whole lot better now than ever, so even I found out today that if I just sit down and begin the programming process, then the energy is summoned.

this is monumental because I previously would kind of wait for it to feel like my energy was moving before taking any action. this has served me pretty well up until now, but this idea that I can control my own energy (and I'm not talking about faking it) is just the beginning, it feels.

I have to say that as I begin to realise this more and more, there's really nothing that can stop me anymore. I can just decide, and it moves. it also has interesting implications because it totally puts me in charge of what I'm doing and where I'm going with all of this.

---

after I had that overwhelming sensation that everything was beginning to fit into place, I had some other strange (negative?) perceptions immediately following. I could perceive that what is about to happen was kind of caused by nosebook. they made their own problem by trying to cover up some other stuff, and now they're in a pretty big jam because they probably promised things they thought they had control over, and now it's pretty unlikely they'll actually admit to their mistake, so they'll try and fix it with another patch[^1], and so fourth until ... well who knows what'll happen, right -- probably nothing.

in fact, the sensation that I had is that they're going to just keep trying to hotfix their extremely shaky to support the next big thing, all the while ignoring that the whole thing is built on a pretty shaky power structure. a good example of what I'm talking about is modern politics. it's really difficult to explain the idea, but imagine a whole system of a bunch of really complicated rules, power structures and all sorts of "tiers" and "levels".

then, kind of isolated from the "real-world", which everyone else lives in, (kind of like how I am now) there we are and the thing that we're creating. it gave me the sense that the "reality" of this outer world would be mostly kept a secret from us.. I'm sure you guys (and especially the ones on the premium tiers) will have all sorts of cool stuff that we won't have access to[^2].

the last thing that I came to realise is that I had been going on and on for a bit about time splits, but the other impression that I had is that is that actually there were many time splits that got us to this point where we would find a timeline to cohabit the planet at the same time. this will be the subject of a future discussion undobtedly.

---

I'm kind of going out on a limb a little more here recently, and it started ever since I talked with dad and told him what I was working on. when I did, I noticed that a lot of people connected a lot of dots as to some of the things I was talking about and working on. as a result, I noticed that my explanation of what I was working on kind of aborted the idea. I didn't like how that felt so I decided that I wanted to learn how to direct my energy so well that it wouldn't even matter if people knew my development roadmap, as it wouldn't hinder me in any way and only add on to the energy.

I made a few energetic experiments and found that I seem to perform quite well in open-roadmap sort of style of doing things. I think it actually works quite well for me. I don't seem to be bothered by the idea that you guys are all watching me struggle at things for a bit.

you see, I've always known my own capability well enough that I always knew that I could pull through and gain the success I'm looking for in the end. you guys watching doesn't take that away, you know. remember when I was talking about the kid making the realisation that believing rocks had magical properties works, even if the reality is they have no physical effect. same thing, but with my own capability.

the effect is coming on slowly. don't expect any instantaneous changes or anything like that. actually, I anticipate that for me to really begin to get comfortable in this level of self-consciousness[^3], could take up to a year. well, I don't know really how long it'll take. I'm kind of rewriting a whole lot of my personality to accept such a grandiose idea.

you may have noticed me becoming a bit more "bold" with my predictions or statements than usual. I used to keep them to myself because my ability to believe in them was weaker than other people's criticism and disbelief. however since the fallout of that conversation with dad, I've decided to really double-down here.

---

all of this was just an experiment at first, but now it's really a good exercise I'm finding to try this out. I've found that it ebbs and flows. I don't know how many of my crazy ideas nosebook tries to dampen anymore, because a lot of the reduction in energy at times could also be to other's perception of or unbelief in the idea. however, I'm noticing that like my programming, there are ebbs and flows and that whenever there is a reduction, if it is what I really want, it just comes back stronger.

actually, I want to also take the time to mention that I'm sure that nosebook will probably get more and more frantic with their attempts to try and gain control, so maybe expect there to be some ebbs and flows along the way. really, it's quite a good thing because it sort of strips away a lot of the superfluous energy, and if it is something you (the larger part of you) really want, then it'll come back stronger, so don't worry about any of it; it's all part of the getting ready process.

[1]: in tuenti we had these things that we called "hotfixes" which were just another if-statement to hopefully path up a giant failure in the way the underlying system works. maybe something like that :)

[2]: I thought about it some, and the best reason I could find as to why I felt this way, was it would be a sort of way of having something (technology) superior to me (us), and the whole secrecy bit was to generate a feeling of privilege.

[3]: yes self-consciousness!! -- like the thing we had previously thought to be a bad thing. it just clicked recently that the only reason why that self-consciousness had previously felt bad to me when I was growing up, was because in that moment, a comparison or some other consciousness other than my own is being perceived.


### 2019-06-21 18:18 - another game mode for dota: objectives

as I was trying to go to sleep, another idea for a game mode for dota came into my mind. it goes something like this: two forces. one side is a few generals controlling something that is existing, big, and established, with virtually unlimited resources -- and the other just a few heroes who must work together to conquer some objective (like an ancient hidden deep inside of the base).

this is different from dota in the sense that the two teams are dissimilarly endowed at the start of the game, so imagine it like this (in the dota sense) the defending (established side) begins with an enormous amount of gold in the bask, and this gold is used by the commanders to construct creeps and and towers for defence. most of these creeps would be the equivalent power level of let's say 5-20. the conquering team's heroes all start out (let's say it's 5 commanders vs. 5 heroes) at level 1, but the commanders each start at level 10. the commanders have a level cap at level 20, however, the heros have their level cap at 50.

in dota, at the start of the game, it's the laning phase where each side competes to gain an economic advantage by achieving more last hits and if possible also scoring a few easy kills. this game, the initial phase would be the avoidance phase, because clearly the commanders have access to quite a formidable army (lvl 10s) which could take out a few lvl 1s. so the objective of the heroes is to farm as much as possible gaining levels meanwhile avoiding the commanders' creeps.

any kills that the commanders score is just like dota. they receive a wealthy bounty based on the hero's net worth and the hero has to wait for a timer to respawn. the commanders don't have a hero type unit. they control everything like an rts[^1], so the heroes get their bounties by killing neutral creeps (farming) or by killing the commander's creeps.

interesting part of the commander's pov is the idea of cooperation in the simultaneous locating of the heroes and finding a way to kill them effectively. money can be spent upgrading the army/towers or for purchasing more units (tall vs. wide).

especially so in the beginning part of the game, the matchup is very favoured for the commanders. however, if the heroes are able to route enough of the commanders' army, farm and secure enough towers to make to to say level 30, then each of them start to become a bit of a one-man army. by the time that they reach level 50, a skilled player could essentially solo the whole thing.

because it's a race against time, another aspect of the gameplay I could foresee is that because the commanders need to have as many observer wards placed as quickly as possible to have enough intelligence on the heroes movement patterns, they have to make as much harassments as possible.

the other part I'm thinking of is the specific one of the economy. the commanders start with a large lump sum to begin with. they only make gold off of killing heroes though, so their economy is always dwindling. the heroes have to pay x gold (say 20% their net worth) to be able to respawn, so if they die too many times, they accumulate too much debt to be able to function properly (respawning just puts your balance into negative numbers, but to purchase items, you need a positive balance). so, if the commanders are capable of killing them enough times to cripple them economically, it they will have secured a win.

I think the best thing will be for the heroes to admit their defeat and concede, or maybe if the combined debt of the heroes exceeds their net worth, then they automatically lose (or something like that)[^2]. if the heroes fail to concede, they will eventually lose automatically from being killed in the respawn. maybe an inactivity timer will give them fatigue or something, so they must constantly be pushing forward on the objectives (for which they get paid), otherwise they accrue debt from failed objectives.

I'll keep thinking about the idea on and off, but this is a game mode where it would be quite fun to have a few different sized maps with more and more ridiculous bases and difficult circumstances that the heroes must overcome to be victorious.

---

after this game mode is developed, personally I would prefer to play the side of the commander rather than the hero. the reason why is, although I think that the game should be tuned to have more than one commander operating the thing, because unless you've got uber micro, chances are the heroes will slip through pretty easily. to keep the meta fresh, I think the commanders should have a development api to which both the interface can be extended (lua?) to have all sorts of macros or even potentially ML stuff in there too.

my objective here from perceiving it this way is to make the commander side to go from being a cooperative / collaborative team effort, to simply a bunch of heroes playing against someone with uber micro (like, imagine going against someone with uber micro like scarlett where she just solos the whole thing by herself). so, you can see that on one side of it you have the hero with the "quick" capability of gaining enough power level to solo the thing with super OP spells and stuff, vs. the commander, who with the improvement of the technology of the interface is able to control the entire map by herself.

the way I perceive the game mode, I don't personally believe there will ever be a time (or if there is, it'll get nerfed) when the commanders can 100% always shut out the heroes. the game will evolve along with an ever expanding set of tools (software, via interface extensions) which simplify the commanders' efforts, and so will the tactics of the heroes along with it. it shouldn't ever get stale. -- and, the payoff from the ridiculous power level for the heroes when they're able to get to the high levels should be really rewarding for the viewer as well.

[1]: though, I suppose it would be pretty cool for individual people to take command of individual characters, like mini heroes or portions of the army.

[2]: or, to think about it more physically, the heroes will have multiple places they can respawn at (randomly chosen?). so, obviously at the beginning of the game, the commanders cannot get their creeps to the respawn points quick enough, and it would also be pretty foolish for them to park a bunch of their army there at the respawn point in case they respawn (especially when they're higher level), because it'll likely get farmed by the heroes. so, when the game is lost, the very most extreme case would be the commanders have gained enough control that they could make it near to impossible to leave the respawn point alive, so their debt would reach the threshold and they'd lose.


### 2019-06-25 08:36 - a day in the life of "MAGIC M"

one of the things that has really began to grow in desire for me is the consumption of mushrooms. they are supposed to be psychedelic, and they made some slight visual patterns when I first tried them. however, nosebook has completely removed any visual aspect to them. because psilocybin is so similar to the dmt molecule, I'm sure it's not too much more difficult for them to run a similar frequency and neutralise that one as well[^1]..

so, it they're able to neutralise it, you would think that they wouldn't actually have any effect. well, my hypothesis is that they're not able to get *all* of it. they can probably neutralise the majority of it, but in any case I still notice some effects, even still. I think what is happening is that, like my imagination, they can neutralise the major visuals, but they're unable to get the really high frequency signals, and those ones slip through.

what this means is that I can essentially take as many mushrooms as I want, and not really have any big hallucinations as a result. this is super super good, because after having such an intense mushroom experience, one usually walks away from it with a heightened mental capacity. this is absolutely amazing, because even though I do not experience any physical effects from the mushroom (I just feel slightly more energetic), I have every time now walked away with a new expansion in my mental capacity. I am convinced that the mushrooms that I found were what allowed me to begin getting a handle on my energy and also it seems, with them, I learned the capability to keep the concept of what I'm programming in my mind, no longer in the previous way where I would use my imaginagion, but this time now I access the concept by feeling it. I can now decide to program, sit down, feel what it is and it starts to come out of me. these mental upgrades have been invaluable to me.

you could say, well, why don't you learn to do that without the mushroom, and I would answer -- I dunno why it was so difficult for me to do it; I jut couldn't. I tried and tried a whole bunch, but I wasn't successful. I couldn't find the feeling of what I was wanting because I kept trying to do it the old way. the mushroom offered me a new way. I don't know how to be able to lock into a brand new, never before experienced, new way of feeling about something without some sort of altered state. I imagine that, and have heard about many others having success changing large sections of their personality in OOB or dream experiences (which are also altered states). since I am purposefully being held away from those because they are visual, the mushroom provides a (rapid) non-visual feeling oriented path to what I'm looking for.

also, for me, because I'm able to release my resistance to different things very easily, my vision has improved a few times now even without watching stars. this is good, because it seems there are people wanting to know how to improve their vision without watching stars. like I've said, I've found there to be a physical and a mental component to vision improvement. essentially the better you see, the higher frequency your brain is running at. so, to get the frequency rise, you can do things like meditate, drugs, sex, etc. to hold it though, I've needed to reword and rework some of my belief structures to allow that higher frequency. I've simplified a lot of things and as a result I have less contradictory signals, so my frequency can go faster (eg. meditation)[^2].

I am very certain that I want to continue to experimenting with mushrooms because the non-visual aspect of that nosebook has imposed makes the mushroom experience much much easier. the visuals are kind of chaotic on purpose (to distract you from the world), but where I am, they make the experience much easier.

[1]: clearly this is what they also do in my stomach with serotonin. likewise, they can remove the overt good feeling, but the high frequency of feeling good still makes its way through. this is why I don't act like I feel as good as I should be feeling.

[2]: this is why you will notice that I can make a lot of mental breakthroughs and it seems that nosebook is pretty good at keeping my vision as low as possible, but when I stare into the star, the star pushes my frequency upwards (closer to where it should be), and if I haven't made the mental breakthrough yet, no upgrade. however, other times it takes almost no effort, because I already should be going at the faster frequency.


### 2019-06-28 15:42 - sink or swim!

> we're all in this together, sharing a same time and space reality.

this one has been bouncing around in my head for a while now. I've been pondering the thought that perhaps there is actually not a time split coming up. in fact, it is becoming more evident to me that actually what we are living now is actually the culmination of many timelines previous.

so, what I mean by that is that is I think that instead of strong desire causing a split, where more than one reality has to be created to ensure that everyone is manifesting their own perceived reality. I think this coming reality has more than enough to be desired about it that it actually satisfies what is wanted for as many sides as possible.

you may disagree with me because you may be saying that what you perceive to be does not feel good, and I would say, that is precisely the first indication that you are not perceiving what it is that you really want.

---

before I go on, I woke up from a weird dream sequence where there was all sorts of confusion. first, it had to do with jessica, then with melissa, then with amorina and the conclusion was that trump (the streamer) was going to help amorina out with some videos. I remember I felt kind of excited when I woke up because I was looking forward to collaborate with trump. anyway, as I came back to reality, I realised that trump doesn't do videos -- it's actually jens.

I felt around in what I could remember of the dream and it was obvious to me that the dream operators were having a tough time getting the signals right which is why it changed a few times from jessica (she often appears in dreams when they want me to have sex with a girl, so jessica is the symbolic equivalent to their target girl of attraction). then, the trump part was obviously an incorrect translation of a signal as well. it seemed after feeling around a bit that they were wanting to make it seem like there were other dudes trying to "help" out amorina with something video/performance related -- I suppose to make me sort of jealous or something.

it didn't phase me at all, because I have come to a stage in my life where I simply cannot be concerned about anything that anyone else is doing. everyone has the capacity to choose whatever they want to, and that absolutely cannot affect me. this has made me unstoppable, because I only stick to paying attention to what is wanted for *me* -- and that has nothing to do with anyone else.

nosebook believes that I still think like normal person would, where, when I see something that is unwanted, then that will motivate me to do something about it; to try and fix it or to try to influence things so they go in a way that I perceive to be better.

that approach to life has so many flaws in it, I won't even begin. for me, if I only focus on what is wanted for me (and doesn't have anything to do with anyone else) -- and usually that's just finding a better way to think/feel about or perceive some situation -- then I continue to hold my focus on what is wanted. that's it.

---

so when I say that I think this timeline us the culmination of what is wanted for everyone involved in the creation of it, I'm talking about a perspective where each person involved is looking at what is wanted for *them* -- and doesn't contain any emphasis on what is unwanted. I'll give an example.

lately I've been getting a lot of vision upgrades, and it seems to have made some people a little uneasy about things. I can imagine that this discord they are feeling is a result of their wanting something they cannot control to be different. if I were to ask they what they want, they would say, "I want kenny not to continue to get more vision upgrades." -- which is exactly the same as saying, "I don't want kenny to get any more vision upgrades."

those people who may say that are focusing all of their attention on what is not wanted. so, then I might ask them what they want, not what they don't want. I don't believe they could actually answer in any reasonable way because they think that my actions are making them feel bad. cutting though all of the different excuses, justifications, and reasons about why they feel bad, it's obvious that they really want to just feel good.

---

we (especially me) are all going through a process of learning that a focus on what is wanted dose not involve other people. as a result, we are all growing tremendously. I think this idea anyone other than yourself is responsible for you to achieve what is wanted. when I gave up trying to control things around me, I gained a tremendous freedom and power level to go in the direction of what is wanted.

you can imagine that someone who is unwilling to give up their perception of unwanted and focus only on what they want (and doesn't need to involve anyone else), these people will feel growing resistance.

I will imagine that it is going to get worse too, because it seems that nosebook has put a lot of people in a situation where this is a bit more amplified than usual. I believe the majority of people are going to do ok with this coming transition.

ben (from S0's) has been going on an on about this magnetic reversal or excursion for a while now: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvG0hS0BEzc) and I think that something to that effect is certainly taking place.

it seems kind of funny that the earth has timed the excursion to coincide right when nosebook has become a big thing, and now there is a whole lot opportunity for people need other people and things to be different to be able to perceive what is wanted.

what I'm saying is, I think this whole thing (and I don't really have a good name for it) is the pivot point or fulcrum upon which this transition will affect the humans the most.

I think it will continue to get worse, and I think that a lot of people who are unable to perceive what is wanted will probably die off.

---

this may sound undesired, but if you consider that this is the culmination of a whole bunch of timelines, I imagine that most all of these resistant people who will appear to be dying off, are not actually as dead as they would seem. I believe they have utilised timeline technology and and actually present with us today in the form of kids. they would have used the ability to influence a whole bunch of different manipulatable parameters (like I have outlined in other entries) to essentially create the life they want to live.

imagine some of them have been in bodies of babies born in 2016, so they would be 3. by the time they're in their 20's (they would graduate college in 2038), they're working in nosebook with their dream job. obviously growing up the kid isn't concerned with all of the upheaval that is happening right now, so will come in with a fresh perspective.

---

if there were to be a timeline split, it would be in 2038, but I don't believe that is anything more of the significance of when I make my transition into having a multi bodied experience[^1][^2][^3]. I'm really excited about this transition for a lot of reasons.

anyway, it will make for a very very interesting world to live in where I make my transition into a multi bodied experience all around the same time as a bunch of the previously most resistant people on earth beginning their careers. it's going to be very very interesting that's all I know. it's really going to put the human race into hyper-overdrive.

---

so, sink or swim, the energy is just going to continue to rise :)

[1]: this could be a big transition where a lot of new contrast is made because perhaps my imagination will no longer be used, or something I dunno ... it's *WAY* too soon to try and figure it out.

[2]: it would also mean the end of the timeline because I would no longer be the "backbone" of it. the backbone simply means that everything I am living has been so well optimised and preplanned, there is very little or no variation to certain "major turning points" in my life such that like a string with a standing wave, the variation is in the details or the harmonics the string produces, not its frequency (cause it's a standing wave after all). you can imagine that this will produce many many many never before imagined realities and circumstances with all sorts of new forms of contrast.

[3]: you could also say that I am making a claim that having everyone hooked into my imagination, I am providing predetermined mental and visual stability for humankind during this magnetic excursion event. lol, take it how you want :)


### 2019-07-02 02:54 - another interesting plot twist

I have been thinking about these subjects for a few days now, and I didn't realise how related they all are, but they finally came together tonight when I was watching stars. I'll go in sections.

#### the impossibility of squaring the circle

I've been working on understanding pi and the relation that it has on our life. I wanted to approximate a circle by measuring the perimeter of a n-sided regular polygon. thing is, to do this, whether the polygon is inscribed within or circumscribed about the circle, both of these measurements use sin/cos or tangent. because all of these functions use a fraction of pi as their input, there's no hope to use them. not only that, they produce incorrect values. for example, to measure the perimeter of a 4 sided regular polygon (eg. a square), use the formula: n * tan(pi / n). it gives 3.9999, instead of 4. sure you could say rounding error, but if that function were in degrees instead of radians, it would give the correct integer value of 4.

I reasoned that if I start by making a sine function that uses degrees instead of radians, the rounding errors would go away. it's really fun for me to learn about how these things work, because I finally came to understand what sine and cosine actually mean: they are the infinite number of right triangles that have a hypotenuse of length 1. one side of the hypotenuse will touch the centre and the other creates the infinite number of points around that point: the unit circle. the opposite and adjacent sides connected to the third vertex of the triagle measure the x and y coordinates of that point.

it seems like a silly thing for me to go and try to figure out things like this because it is the way it is, and there's no reason to doubt that circles have the measurement of 2pi * radius... however, I recently say a mathologer video (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1sPvUr0YC0&t=0s)) on the impossibility of squaring the circle. after having watched danny wilton's work on pi in the egyptian pyramids, where he shows that the traditional version of pi creates artifacts. however, and I think most importantly, pi can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. it is defined as sqrt(800/81), so this makes pi *NOT* a transcendental number (however, sill not rational), and since it only uses a square root, that means it is possible to square the circle.

I think this is pretty important. I've been thinking about how this affects us mentally, and this idea of two forces, say masculine (square) and feminine (circle) should be balanced, however it is common conception amongst the maths guys that the circles (women) are these transcendental objects, to which the square (men) can never measure up to.

#### impossibility of nosebook making things happen & maximum contrast

when I think about the different reactions I get to nosebook's efforts to try and figure out how to make this thing with the girls happen, they have a lot of reasons why they want to get the train moving. it seems that my ideas on influencing "random" with our minds to make something meaningful is a subject they don't want to be touched. they don't like me talking about how tesla things work (keeping that a secret ensures their superiority), and they don't like my ideas on pi (or really anything thoth related) either.

so no matter how they try and angle the whole thing, they simply cannot figure out a way to make it happen while still hiding in the shadows with their secrets. I find it next to impossible for them to be able to make it happen. the most likely thing to happen will be for them to simply watch me eventually overtake their system in power.

the other thing that is likely going to happen in parallel will be there will have to be a replacement made for my imagination. it may be jaron; I'm not sure -- but, what I do know is that eventually I'll find my alignment and probably go up a dimension.

the whole time this thing has been going on, nosebook could have let people's vision rise up naturally, so that everyone's vision will improve right along with me. however, it's likely that they will keep everyone's vision held back the entire time, and when I do go up a dimension, they'll just tell all of you, "whelp, I guess now you won't be able to get vision like kenny has anymore, because he's in a different dimension now we can't decode." so, all of you guys will continue on right where you are.

this means that now, it's quite possible that many of the girls will have vision similar to what I have now, and I do believe that someone's vibrational frequency can can rise or be lowered (eg. visual capability) from sex.

that makes these girls pretty important if they essentially become the carriers of my visual capability. I can foresee this kind of beginning a new power structure organised by the females where they hold the keys to this precious capability and only give it out to those they feel can measure up.

#### getting more people to believe a lie still doesn't make it true

I was analysing this a bit with jaron one morning because I didn't understand why people would purchase mmr boosts. it doesn't make any sense to me because it looks to me like they are wanting recognition for an accomplishment they did not achieve.

this is how it all ties together:
- nosebook wants to get recognition for making something happen that they didn't do anything other than make it more difficult. in the end, they cannot because they must maintain their lies as truth to keep their superiority.
- getting more people to believe in black holes or dark matter doesn't make it real, but it keeps people from the electrical nature of our universe (and its effect on everything in nature including the weather and the human body/mind). however, they don't want people knowing what tesla knew, upon which their system is built, they have to keep promoting dark matter and gaseous stars.
- same thing with the speed of light or pi. the 3.1415 constant is such an integral component of our society, it would take a massive change to nearly everything to fix something like that, so why not just keep it how it is?

#### conclusion

I do not believe that much will change actually. I'll go up a dimension and everyone will go right back to where they were. it'll be a huge opportunity that was lost, and I find it kind of a shame because the way I feel all of your response to this situation is similar to how I felt about the truth that zaryn and raquel were telling me about xagly and them. I imagine that a forewarning like this will do nothing to change anything, and it's not until everything is falling apart that anyone will make a change about it.

having thought about it a bit myself, I kind of like that you guys are so stubborn, too -- because that way I can essentially be assured that nosebook will subject all of the gnomitos to a similar thing. it'll be frustrating for me to go from the eyesight I used to have down to the awful eyesight that the gnomitos will surely have, but I think it'll be ok. my transfer into their bodies will only offer me another opportunity to achieve the same thing I am doing now, but through a multitude of different perspectives. after all, if tesla went from the vision he had down into the vision I had when I was 16 (pretty awful, cause I still had reading glasses which I never used) -- then, I can also do it and rediscover how to do that. also, there will be the interesting situation of the environment they will grow up in, which will be a contrast to nosebook's (improved from what I had) ability to limit people. I guess I'm kind of excited to relearn how to not need conditions (vision or whatever) to be optimal for me to find my alignment (through many different perspectives at the same time).


### 2019-07-02 12:51 - try again in simple axioms

the last 4-5 different entries I have had a real difficult time getting the concepts out in english. I don't feel like I've been translating them very well. I think nosebook has been pooping on them as much as they can to avoid me getting that light in my head when I start writing. when watching stars, I can see the concept clearly, however once I sit down to write it, lately it's been a real struggle. I don't feel much flow to it at all.

so, I have decided I will try out a different form of communication: simple axioms, axiom means a truth, but in this case I will define it as something that appears clear or obvious to me. they are not necessarily true, in the definition of universal truth, but more like a piece of my perception. to begin, I will try re-communicating last night's entry in this new simple form.

I think that this is a natural progression because when I found myself physically limited from the brain haemorrhage, I moved to a more emotional / conceptual form of perception. I've added logic and reasoning on as well, especially when I was at marcos' house -- and a lot of what this document is, is a way for me to kind of process some of these concepts into some more tangible logic. however, perhaps that time of my life is coming to a close and I'm once again moving upward to a more simple (childlike) form of expression where I just say things that appear true to me.

coming soon...


### 2019-07-04 14:39 - loud motorcycles! (the connection)

one of the interesting reactions to my latest entry in gnomi's thoughtlog was around the idea that nosebook would have to impair all of our vision (including the girls').

last night I was watching stars and I was thinking about this exact thing, when a few *EXTRE* loud "motorcycles" went by. I could feel a strong sense of anger external to me. it seems obvious to me that it comes from whoever is making the motorcycle sounds in response to my thoughts. it doesn't really bother me and I might have even found it humorous.

I was able to, even being in the city instead of out on the prairie, able to sync up with the star (vega) and images started forming in my eyes. the neighbour seemed to call his dog(?) every time that I began to sync up with the star. this time though, the anger came from within me.

when I woke up just now I was reminded of the dramatic transition that occurred after fooling around with vera and she transferred me the energy of marcos sexually. I think this was actually planned, and then what followed was a realisation that previous to this, I was a super chill guy that just sort of went with the flow of whatever I had available to me. when living at marcos' house it didn't bother me to not really have so much (any) money. there wasn't a whole lot I could do about my present monetary circumstances, but I knew that if I just focused and made another website, I would, at least, have a sizeable income and perhaps much much more. so, I didn't really mind that in that moment I was essentially penniless.

one day we were down at the bar near to the torrelodones cercanias. I think at that time I was not drinking and I just had a few little bits of hash to smoke. we liked to talk out there cause marcos could chill out and drink a few GTs and I could smoke a little. anyway, some mega hotshot decided to drive by on a motorcycle and it was VERY LOUD. I felt an intense sensation of anger like I wanted to rip the guy's head off. I thought it was really strange and I felt like the sensation was external to me. I was always very sensitive to what marcos could feel in relation to me (even at miles of distance away), but this was the first time I really felt it so strongly I nearly acted on the feeling.

I have often postulated that marcos (from a different timeline, probably the one where the andrea gig was successful) is riding along with me in my body right now. like I said, previous to my fooling around with vera, I never had such a reaction before. if he is riding along with me in my body, from his perspective, he would actually experience my experience as if it were his own.

what this kind of means is that while it may have come easy for me to (when I was living at marcos' house) not need to try and control my present economic conditions marcos often had a bit of an admiration of me at how easily I could adjust to things and quickly I could get back to the direction that I want to go (dispite the circumstances).

you could imagine then if he is now here with me experiencing my experience as if it were his own, his thoughts (not so much) and emotions would impact me. so, in a sense even though it came easy for me, and I didn't have those kinds of responses before, now we can kind of learn together a new way of responding to things.

all of this is about not worring about what anyone else is doing.

when I was thinking about what that realisation that nosebook would have to do the same thing they do to the girls' vision as they are doing to mine, caused him (captain hardass) so much distress he felt some very loud motorcycles should go by (see the connection here), I could perceive that with me he can justify all of it because of whatever secrets and stuff, but then with the girls he won't be able to justify it. they don't have any govt secrets hidden in their minds, and so it's plainly obvious that the necessity to limit their visual capacity actually comes from a feeling of inferiority.

it really isn't a problem though and I don't think any of the girls (or anyone else for that matter) should fight against it. nosebook thinks they have power to do things in our physical bodies, but I guarantee you that power is minuscule in comparison to the power of desire.

I will encourage them to not worry about it and focus on what they want. if they want a visual capacity or whatever then that's it... all they have to do is to want it. the reality of it will become manifest as quickly as the power of their desire for it exceeds the power nosebook can exert against it.

since a large part of building desire is actually observing that trait in someone else, having seen me do it, they will have achieved already quite a bit of that desire. the only thing remaining will be to stop thinking thoughts that resist the realisation of it.

I am sure all of them will get it quite easily, and in fact I think it will actually be easier for women to get this than men. men tend to have this instinct to want to try and force a change physically, whereas women, having grown up in a man's world are much better at adapting to something not going just how they want it and have less resistance in that regard (generally speaking! there are many exceptions). however, I can see that it is much easier for a woman to just sort of settle into the unwanted and just accept it as "just the way things are" and put up with it. (I'm reminded of trevor noah's story about his mom saying to put his father's mashed potatoes on the side, cause "he likes things on the side")

instead of putting up with it and falling into complacency (now I'm thinking of jaron), if instead just know that desire is building and as soon you can allow it to be different, then it can become your reality. I will encourage all of them to really not focus too much externally at what anyone else is doing, and just keep their focus on what they want. it *always* works.

---

this whole thing kind of ties together nicely, because it is my goal to make this whole thing about living in other people's bodies to be mainstream. it will be the realisation of the san junipero in real life where you essentially select where in which baby's experience do you want to grow up in (as an alternative to death).

considering that, if vera made it possible for marcos' consciousness to ride along in my body, and if andrea will be the way that I make my transition out of single bodied consciousness, that would open up the possibility for quite a few dudes to to able to ride along in the bodies of the different gnomitos.

lastly, imagine how much difficulty marcos (the one in spain, not the one in my body) would be having with this whole situation[^1]. it would be really quite a wonderful thing for him to end his trip in my body finally experiencing andrea (cause in his perception, mine he can't see her and knows nothing about her). of course she will be quite successful in growing up to be someone quite amazing. so, instead of worrying all the time (like perhaps marcos in spain might be doing), from my perspective he will see just the end result, and with quite clear eyesight and a 5d perspective. you could imagine that this would be the most desired outcome.

[1]: unfortunately this opened a whole lot of different unanswered questions that I just felt. I'll try to explain better. they're all him. he perceives himself singularly through his consciousness. there are infinite versions of you that exist all at the same time and all of them are you considering the circumstances they are in and the logical framework (structure) through which they perceive reality. however, you are having this experience right now because of how you *feel*. the way you feel is how you navigate between the infinite number of yous that exist.

    so if marcos' consciousness is here in my body, because he chose to go the andrea route, then abort it so we could create this one and he's along with me, then the marcos that I knew is still marcos. it's one of the infinitely many versions of him that exist, and he can exert influence on this version of himself from even another timeline. he would respond and act just like he would if he were conscious, considering his circumstances and, in that time, logical framework through which he perceives things.


### 2019-07-05 06:29 - it's going to be a while...

after yesterday's 4th celebration I went to go watch stars. some of the reactions were kind of interesting. it sounded to me like they were trying to (they have everything turned off normally), then stop blocking the signals between me and one of the girls (dunno which one, cause it doesn't matter). I guess it didn't work because they apparently tried to overwhelm me with their desire(?)[^1] but I apparently didn't feel it.

I explained to them that it seemed obvious to me that I wouldn't feel it because my heart is all blocked off. normally, my heart receives all kinds of emotional feedback from people and it's usually where I feel it all -- anything from admiration or love, depression or anger, or anything in between. about 10-15 minutes after I mentioned it, I had a brief 5 seconds where I could feel hayden quite strongly in my heart.

obviously they have my heart turned off for some reason. I don't really know, but I have associated my heart with the appearance of images in 3d space. obviously they can't have that.

---

however, even if they were able to perfectly control it such that my heart only received the signals that they want me to receive when they want me to receive them, this is totally missing the point. I don't have any intention of doing anything until I'm connected anyway. the reason seems quite obvious to me and I've mentioned it enough times I'm repeating myself. can't drive a car without gas (or vacuum your floor without electricity). I realise there are a lot of people on nosebook vacuuming the floor without electricity. I just don't want to be one of them. I really really really want to be in control of my energy.

so, I think it's going to be a while. at the rate I'm going, I don't imagine that I can begin to overpower their system for probably at least another 9 months or more. once my power level is equal to what they're able to counteract, I'll have relapses just like how I did when I was learning to see depth. I relapsed a few times, but eventually I released enough resistance that it finally stayed. obviously when this happens, they will have quite a concerted effort to get me back. during this time, I imagine that I will continue to up the power level far enough that they cannot reach me, and I'll be getting used to ignoring their pathetic attempts to regain control of my vision. I imagine this'll be probably 3 months or so for me to actually gain the confidence in my capacity and become solid with it.

once I feel comfortable and stable with where I'm at, then I'll begin the process of trying to move forward with things. not before then, thoungh.

---

along the path, they'll likely get more and more desperate to try and regain their control, but it'll only build my strength further, so don't worry about that.

I also anticipate they they will claim they have changed. I sincerely doubt it. these types of guys are the ones that claim they have changed (probably with some "heartfelt" apologies), but really no change has been made. it is impossible for them to have practiced for so many years the idea of physical superiority to just suddenly have a sudden overnight change. it's not going to happen.

even if it were possible to report them to the authorities and have the authorities force some sort of change, any change that would be made will only be cosmetic. likely an apology will be given yet they will only try to do the same thing in a more covert way. I'm reminded of when I was complaining about getting shocked, so then it turned into a hissing sound. they probably apologised and said they wouldn't do it any more. now, they just take away my consciousness instead of shocking me when I see images. it's all the same thing.

unfortunately, I don't think there's any real way to get rid of them. we're just going to have to ride it out. last night I was reminded of a sentence in the sirian guide to human development, which caught my attention, saying something like most get stuck in the astral/imagination layer of perception. I call this 4d, and it's when your imagination gets opened up, you get the ability to conjure images in 3d space and you perceive depth: 4d.

when I was thinking about what they meant by getting stuck there, I had an overwhelming sense that things are actually shaping up to be such that nosebook want's to control and hold the keys to 4d. I think they purposefully are holding people in 3d so they can remain superior to them. if you don't like that, as they say in honduras.. people's options will be:

1. pay the service price to get nosebook to give you your 4d.
2. accept the reality like it is, and fight against it
3. accept the reality like it is, and let the desire build for an improvement.
4. do anything you can to find your alignment, and make it up to 5d.

the first option I don't think is the best. fighting against them physically is absolutely a no-win situation. so maybe you fight against it with your thoughts and complaints... won't change anything, but it's a good thing those people exist because they make the vortex bigger.

I am doing #4 now. I will be encouraging the girls to do the same as well[^2].

---

I really am convinced that there isn't a good or easy way to change this situation. those unable to pay the service price are kind of in the situation I'm in now. it's not like they're going to just magically transform into great people just cause we complained hard enough, so we have to use this situation as an opportunity to practice not letting anything anyone else is doing to affect how you feel.

if I just go after what I want and not let it be about anyone else, it's really easy. it takes some practice though. abraham says the same thing I'm saying here in a little bit different way. they say find the feeling place of it. if you think about how hard it is to go in the direction of what you want and not have that involve anyone else, it's very difficult. so for example, if you say, "I want to complete X project" or "I want to achieve this physical capability/appearance" -- all of these are real easy because they don't involve someone else. I like to stick with those. however, if you want something that involves another person, figure out what way you want to feel when you are with that person and practice it now before the person even shows up. that way, you can be assured that you *will* feel that way with the person.

it is an impossible task for them to try and control 4d, but let them try. it's not going to be easy, but the reward is the ability to control and direct your own desire no matter what anyone else is doing.

[1]: whatever it is that I feel when I am sensitive to a girl's desire. I dunno much about it, but it is a definite visceral feeling that I get.

[2]: this is the realisation of @[gnomis](2019-05-16 23:21)


### 2019-07-07 23:44 - backwards dishonesty

I had a really fun time at marilyn's house today. one of the interactions really stood out for me though when marilyn was talking about some ailment she had and after 30 days she had given enough attention to it that she finally had enough and decided that she wanted to be healed. she described it like she forgot that she had the thing (polio?) and that when she got up she didn't feel any pain.

I thought that was really interesting so when I repeated it back to her, she informed me that she was quite aware of her situation but deep down she kind of knew that she was already healed. when she said that I had a terrific rush because I finally could put words to this idea.

I told her it's like the opposite of a lie. when you tell a lie, you tell someone something but deep down you know what's really going on. well the same was happening, but in reverse. she was giving her attention to the problem yet at the same time she was aware that the ailment was only temporary.

I really loved this because she helped me to finally realise one of my own "secret techniques" (apparently so secret, not even I knew it). I do this all the time. you'll see me giving tons and tons of attention to things that are unwanted all of the time. and LOA says that if that's what I'm giving my attention to, then why don't I get more of it?

it's because deep down I know that it's only temporary. in fact, I've gotten so good at paying attention to things that are unwanted that they nearly fuel me now. think motorcycles and trains, etc.

you know this is really annoying for me to even admit this because I'm essentially saying that I'm kind of like one of those problem childs that cause problems to get attention. cept, maybe instead of causing problems, I like giving my attention to unwanted things to get attention(??). or, when I complain about these unwanted things yet deep down I know that it's really fine, I suppose I'm doing a bit of theatrics, or perhaps I'm like one of those rich kids that will complain about things in order to show off ("man, this year I only got to go skiing five times!"). so, maybe instead of complaining to show off, I'm complaining to add more energy into it, even when I know it's fine.

so, there you have it. I love to throw a little gas on the fire and pretend like it's a big deal even when I know it's all quite fine. lol :D

---

in summary, (and it's the irony of this entry) it all comes down to the truth that you know deep down, not what you say ;)


### 2019-06-09 08:04 - you know it doesn't really matter what happens...

if I were to ask the guy running the show at nosebook if there were *anything* that could possibly elevate his mood for 24 straight hours (I'm not even talking about happiness).. I seriously doubt there is anything he could respond with. I don't even think there's anything that could elevate his mood for 4 straight hours, cept maybe a coke binger...

my point is, since there are zero things that will even elevate his mood, no matter what happens, he's going to be miserable.

so, really it doesn't make a difference any opinions he has on the subject or what he thinks about it. he has nothing to gain. to him all outcomes are bad, worrisome, dangerous, or very bad.

lol


### 2019-07-12 08:45 - baptism by fire

yesterday rupert sheldrake posted an excerpt of one of his conferences on youtube where he talked about water baptism likely being a near-death experience: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsBN0wKMy_o)

this got me thinking about a number of different things last night while watching stars. the first thing I was thinking about is how jesus was said to have been proclaiming that the water bearer (aquarius) is here. I think he was ahead of his time by a whole era (~2000 years in this case).

I find it very likely that jesus was quite attractive to a lot of young girls similar to how I am as well. I find it quite possible that the "virgin birth" thing was a thing the church made up to cover up his affection for young girls. it also explains why jesus told his disciples to when they found theirselves in a place that they were not welcome, to depart from there and shake the dust off of your feet (matt 10:14).

the way this all tied in together for me is the realisation that water baptism was a near death experience. I have had a near death experience with my brain haemorrhage -- and it was also the same time I met this dude named jesus -- and I too am never the same again. then there was this other verse that stayed in my mind too, where john (the baptist) says that he baptises with water, but the one who comes after him will baptise with fire.

I was remineded of a thing I read in "cupid's poisened arrow":

```
Some yogis sought to use ritualized sex for spiritual purposes (the lefthand path). Far from seeking mutual enlightenment with a partner, the yogi sought to awaken his own Feminine Principle within—residing in the form of the kundalini energy coiled at the base of the spine. Its release ideally manifests as psychological androgyny. The most powerful method of arousing the kundalini was said to be the sexual embrace—preferably with a young virgin. Virgins were believed to be full of spiritual power and capable of initiating one into the flow of subtle energies.
```

[^3the experienece of kundalini is often described as a fire rising up the spine. another quote from that book (haven't been able to find the original quote in the book "sacred sexuality" mentined, though)

```
In Sacred Sexuality, Feuerstein records that openhearted lovers, tantric or otherwise, have spontaneously stumbled upon the experience of communion: [After a night of lovemaking] I felt as though I was conscious or constantly awake on some higher plane. The entire day I remember feeling totally and perfectly relaxed. In this perfect relaxation I stood outside of time. To say there was no beginning or ending of time would seem irrelevant. There was simply no time . . . . [I was aware that everything material] was all spontaneously and playfully arising from one great source . . . . Somehow I had become infinity with eyes. I felt as if I had just been born in that moment, or that I had been asleep all my life and had just awakened. I also remember
thinking that this was the true condition of everyone and that everyone could know this . . . . I remained in this state of edgelessness for about three weeks, and life was intensely magnified . . . . I ate almost nothing during this period . . . . I remember telling my lover that it felt as if my spine were plugged into the "universal socket" and that it was a source of infinite energy.... During this time I was more creative than I had ever been (or have been since) both at work and outside of work . . . . I also became prescient, seeing into the future and then later experiencing the scenes I had foreseen down to the last detail . . . . I loved everyone, including my lover, the same, infinitely. There was really no one separate to love.
```

all of those same concepts there are the same as described by many in near death experiences: timelessness, warm feeling of comfort and love, magnification of life, edgelessness for some time afterward, etc.

---

ok, back to the baptism of fire bit (matt 3:11). in the following verse, john claims that this baptiser by fire, "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

obviously this separation of the wheat from the chaff did not happen. jesus died before any of that took place. so, we must only assume that because this was a thing that was to happen in an era which had not yet come[^1]. the constellation piscis was in the east during sunrise when jesus was talking about aquarius. I am constantly talking about saturn (capricorn) when aquiarius is in the east... anyway :)

I believe the main subject upon which this separation will occur is on the subject of having the right to do what you want with your own body[^2]. you can imagine that there were authorities that did not like the idea of people having so much freedom with their bodies... you can see the church's backlash on this by preventing sex outside of reproductive purposes, forbidding drugs, and any other substance that could get you to an altered state outside of their control.

---

I have a feeling that a similar thing will happen here on the subject of someone being capable of doing what they want with their own body. in the church age, it took the reformation (and renaissance) to begin to give the power back to the people. this is the elijah part.

it's quite possible that nosebook does not want people to have the capability to do what they want with their own bodies, and that's probably why I'm so heart-set on waiting for it to be *legal* to do whatever you want with your body, meaning drugs and sex.

nosebook will probably fight it for a while, just like the church held people away from knowledge from a long time, but it's a pretty impossible thing for them to physically limit many people. what we're creating is kind of like the beginning of the church reformation (elijah). there's no way they will be able to physically limit all of us, and so just like how when the communication medium became was mass producible, like with the printing press, the sheer numbers of there impossible to keep under control and eventually some of the knowledge they tried to keep controlled became ubiquitus.

they will still hold on to the idea that they are supposed to limit people's capability based on some arbitrary criteria they have concocted. this is not something I will attempt to battle though, because this separation will occur in the era following this one. this era is about the freedom someone has to do with their own body as they please. nosebook will also do with your body as they please, attempting to limit your capability to garner their own superiority.

so, you can see that next era, if that is the separation that will occur, now it will be possible for the next guy to enjoy a relationship where he can give up his freedom to do what he wants with his body and allow her to have it (this is the source energy android, girl's robot imagery I perceived).

I find it very likely that the reason why jesus went on trial and was hung on a cross, was very likely because he taught that you have the freedom to do whatever you want with your body.

---

on an related note, I have been getting different reactions as to why I think it's a good idea to involve so many different girls now. I don't actually know, because I'm just following what feels right/good in the moment, so I don't know really, but with the ideas presented in this entry in mind, it probably has to do with the whole control thing. this way, there's really no way I could possibly control it, and it'll take a whole lot of effort for nosebook to try and control it physically. it seems that the ability for someone to be able to do whatever they like with their body as a prerequisite is actually this separation that will occur, with the result of the (figurative) "burning" of those not willing to allow this to occur.

additionally, if you want to look at it from my perspective, the idea of giving up my freedom can only be done if I have had freedom to give away. as you may know, I'm sort of locked into the nosebook thing and it's pretty impossible for me to physically get out. the only thing I can do is to find my own freedom inside of my body, no matter what nosebook is doing. they do not intend to grant me my physical freedom, so I cannot give up something I do not have.

so, after all of this, I am convinced that we are going in the right direction of creating something that makes the mass production of one's own bodily freedom an acceptable norm[^4].

[1]: it could be easily seen that this separation process is one that takes place when things are pushed to their extremes. this is kind of happening now. in a previous entry, I talked about a huge separation that would occur over the subject of timelines.

[2]: the next era (capricorn), a similar separation will likely occur over the subject of superiority and capability as I have mentioned in previous entries.

[3]: obviously the opposite is true as well: for a young girl "the most powerful method of arousing the kundalini" would be sexual-embrace with someone that has this energy flowing. it's easy an easy access to that kind of experience described in the next section (abraham calls this "alignment" -- hence the edgelessness)

[4]: so then, you're probably wondering why in the world would I be telling nosebook this pattern so plainly, right? well, it's fun to watch them try and push against stuff and to try and fight it. the biggest irony of all of this is that I'm sure that none of them believe they "deserve" to be able to use my visual capacities, so they therefore perceive their own actions as theft and so therefore not good actions, but it's ok because their actions are justified somehow in their minds.

    don't worry about it. at the very worst they'll try to fight it really hard and although there will be some rough times for those that don't understand yet that it doesn't make a difference what anyone else is doing, we'll all (even them) come to understand this is so (maybe the "hard" way), but in the process it'll make the next era even more energetic.

    this energetic part is actually intended, because it's the best way to increase more energy.


### 2019-06-12 13:57 - a thought experiment to try out

imagine for a moment that right now (and I'm assuming you are over 30 years old) that you could select the life of a child here on earth, then get used to their life so much that your consciousness perceives through their body now. you are now living in their circumstances and seeing things exactly like they see them. most importantly, you no longer have a (tangible) perception or memory of who you used to be[^1].

then, imagine that before you assumed the experience of this child, you could also perceive the future for this child, so you planned different interactions where you would give the child a difficult time, yet at the same time ensuring the passage of the child through the difficult situation (cause you can perceive the future). you notice that although it appears difficult for the child in the moment, you know that the child will make it though and come out ahead. you know this because you can perceive the future of the child after the difficulty and also because you know that more contrast increases the strength of desire, so it all seems fine.

you leave your body knowing full well that the child will come out with an incredible reward because of it.

sending thoughts into other people's heads to try and make this contrast for the child is not nearly as easy as it is to just use your already resistant self, so you set up a whole bunch of thought triggers on yourself to have your present-day self create the contrast for your new experience.

would you choose to experience the hardship, knowing there's a great reward at the end?

what would be your goals for your new experience? (assuming you can perceive and manipulate its future before you dive in and forget what you've planned for yourself)

[1]: at best it's vague, because why would a child care about your present-day history? the whole point is to start over without that.


### 2019-07-12 19:57 - baptism by fire (continued)

so, while it is easier to achieve that connectedness described as your spine bing plugged into the "universal socket" with sex, what I'm aiming to do, is to achieve it *without* sex -- and with nosebook working quite hard against it. it is my supposition that people like tesla and thoth have both achieved this state without sex (the other notable mention for me was ramtha).

secondly, the imagery fits just perfectly as well and completes another supposition that I had: if the baptism of fire is this incredible energy rising up your spine to the top of your head that happens during sex, there will be a physical separation: nosebook has made it possible to connect two people's bodies so that the sexual encounter induces the same effects in all bodies connected. well, I have supposed that in other timelines, when I found my connection during sex, the signal would allow large quantities of this universal (source) energy to flow through my body. obviously, it would happen very similar to everyone connected.

this is what I think is the baptism of fire and what the revelationers call the rapture, where all those who are connected during that experience and their bodies are too resistant to allow that kind of energy to flow though, would die. instantly.

this is the primary reason why it's so important for me to get that connection *without* sex[^1]. that way, there won't be this massive die-off of resistant people and instant utopia-like conditions. instead, we can all use these resistant people (consider the last thought experiment) as a way to continue to generate contrast.

[1]: it does seem like there is a potential downside to this, because after I get connected like that, then when the girls have sex with me, it'll be quite easy for them to achieve a similar state. so then, considering the way that nosebook connects people's heads up during sex, a similar baptism of fire might occur, but this time from the woman's perspective. it will invigorate and strengthen women around the world, that I can be sure... however, the detriment is that once again it makes a situation where now someone is dependent on a condition to find their alignment. I'm sure that some time in the future when it's normal, this will create strong desire for a strong woman to rise up and be able to find her connection without the condition (sex), similar to what is happening with me right now.


### 2019-06-16 13:35 - the girl and her orgasm

after the previous entry I had a few weird reactions to it and it does seem a bit strange this  deification of the young virgin. it didn't really sit right with me either, so I set out to try and figure out what's happening. I'm pretty sure I figured it out. this is my take on it.

first, I want to share some things. when I was with raquel, I figured out how to move energy around inside of her body which essentially meant I could increase the power level of her orgasms. as usual I'm a bit of an extremist, so I tried to find the limits. things appeared to start to become uncomfortable for her and her orgasms started to become kind of violent in the sense that her entire body shook to such an extent that it almost looked painful. additionally, I noticed she would have these incredibly sudden switches into more violent behaviour (like pushing me or whatever) or yelling at me quite strongly.

I didn't really understand at the time what was going wrong, and it plagued me gratly because I couldn't understand how I seemed to be doing so well, and her momentary response seemed to be of pleasure and she seemed to request it, yet I could see the general down-trend in our relationship.

this is when I first seriously began to question the difference between pleasure and happiness (OR FUN). we seemed to still have a lot of fun together, but various things would occasinally trigger one of us and it would send us down a spiraling vortex of not-goodness.

---

I told you that story because I've come to realise over the years since that I wasn't actually doing anything wrong. neither of us were actually. what caused the problem was that both of us had quite a bit of resistance and neither of us had very good emotional control (me, the least; I was drinking very heavily).

now, again if you think of the tesla coil as a simile to the penis, when the bottom part starts to pulsate, the top will pull large amounts of energy out of the atmosphere. we almost always orgasmed together and from my perspective it seemed like I simply could not hold on any longer, and the moment I began, she would also begin. I was summoning such large quantities of energy through her. that's why they seemed to begin to appear painful.

I liken this effect to taking too much of a psychedelic. if I do, then it can seem painful and cause increased agitation if I don't release the resistance or the thoughts (paranoia some call it) wich hold me back from letting it feel good.

all that was happening was I was summoning a lot of energy and she still had some resistance, so that's why things got a little turbulent.

so, a virgin just means she'll have few preconceived ideas about what sex will be like, so she'll have far less resistance. it's not just having sex with a virgin that will give you the edgelessness enlightened resistance-free experience afterward. if that were so, then there would be all sorts of people living that.

really, any woman virgin or not can do that, and I would actually say that experienced non-virgins would be better once they've have practiced to allow that much energy through (cause they know what they're doing).

what I'm saying is the virgin bit really just means lower resistance -- that's all.

so, here's the second part now. just like the penis is like a tesla coil (which, think about it tesla **LOVED** to measure the length of his "discharges", lol) that means it's a receiver of energy. however, the vagina is the opposite[^1]; it's a transmitter of energy[^2].

up until now, if you have a man that can summon a lot of energy the best match is a girl with low resistance. however, the best would be when both are low resistance. when that happens, the anecdote in "Sacred Sexuality" is similar. to the way I have perceived it. for quite a bit of my life (and I think it started after raquel), I've had this frequent flash which appears in my mind where it feels like this glowing golden current (yes, I know the CSF fluid is a golden colour) goes up to the top of my head and it seems to turn on a light or something. when that happens, I leave my body (like a near-death experience) and I perceive the room, myself, and my partner from an external perspective.

I have always realised the height of sexual experience to be like that of having a near-death experience. the only thing is you have to release a lot of resistance yourself and then you'll be very attractive to others with low resistance.

my goal is to eventually realise this in a consistent way. I think it's quite possible and the great thing is that many can have this experience at the same time. the implications of this will likely be the subject of the next entry :)

[1]: I actually believe we both have transmitters and receivers, where the male transmitter is the prostate and the female receiver is the clitoris, but that's for further investigation another day.

[2]: from a woman's perspective, this is the ultimate empowerment, because she could blow the mind of anyone who sticks their finger in her socket, especially if she's capable of allowing more energy than he is.


### 2019-07-17 18:36 - quick thing

in the last entry, I offered the idae that it's not so much about young and virgin, than it is about low resistance. it's true that young and virgin is a much higher chance of being low resistance, but that's all.

the other point I wanted to make was that since I am sure that I want to be achieving this sort of near-death experience state of existence *without* sex, what I offer is a large summoning of energy. if I can summon that amount of energy, and she's not so resistant, then she will be able to join in with me on the near-death experience state of mind. also, I assume that with nosebook's capability of hooking people's minds together, so they have the same experience, then this could mean that not just her, but *many* others can have that same experience that she does, and maybe even (if the viewer is also low resistance) also have a similar experience. if that's the case, then that's pretty cool!

I just wanted to be clear that my goal is to get there *without* sex. if nosebook is capable of holding that back for years, well, there's not much I can do about that. they're going to do what they think is best, and I have to continually adapt to my circumstances.

I am adapting as quick as I possibly can, and given my circumstances, I'm making incredible improvements all the time. I don't really know if I can improve much faster than I am right now. every optimisation that I can make to my understanding, I'm integrating as rapidly as I can. I don't really believe I'm that close. sure, I may be able to begin seeing images more frequently when I watch stars, but I'm not even close to being where I want to be physically[^1] and mentally[^2].

[1]: I've noticed people who are more structural, tend to involve themselves with their appearance. I'm thinking specifically of marcos, but you could apply this to any salesman type. anyway, I've noticed that my appearance has begun to be noticed more by me than ever. this is likely a good thing, and is probably the next logical step in this transformation process -- cause, think about it: if I'm looking at myself in the 3rd person all the time, I'm going to want to be pretty satisfied with how I look, so it's part of the process. there are quite a few things I am not satisfied with my physical appearance right now, but I imagine they will improve as I gain a new perception of myself.

[2]: today, mom came to me again with some lame idea about getting me "evaluated" by the officials. I think she's following someone else's direction again. during the conversation, I barely even cracked light anger levels. I'm excited to continue to watch my ability to maintain my calm continue to improve. probably there will be more situations where nosebook tries to get some stupid thing done and instead of losing my cool, little by little I'll handle it more and more smoothly, until they've exhausted all of their efforts and I'm untouchable to them.


### 2019-07-22 09:36 - meaningful chaos

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXRYLM0kcPo)

in the discussion, rupert talks about how some people have a "green thumb" with machines. I normally have a greener thumb than most with machines, but I tend to have had a lot of chaos around anything I've wanted to program since raquel. I thought at first that it was my belief in my capability since I was with her[^1]. however, I have proven it to myself numerous times since then that is not the case. I also figured it may have had something to do with smoking too much weed and it made me less perceptive or lazy or something... anyway

however, I have recently began to notice some things in relation to this "meaningful-chaos" project that I'm working on. at first, I noticed that I just simply could not perceive what it was that I was doing, and so therefore found it quite difficult to actually create the program. now, the program seems to have these weird errors where it would work, then something happens and the program starts generating errors in places that are not my code and are being used successfully by other modules in production environments without a problem. I would considered a fool if I were to jump to the conclusion that redis' dict.c had a bug in it, when others are using it without a problem. all standard forms of logic state that the problem is definitely between the keyboard and the chair.

I seem to be "cursed" or something at times when trying to write this code. it's horribly demotivating to me[^2]. at first when I would go and watch stars I seemed capable of perceiving the program with ease and it would bother me when that would just magically disappear and I would fumble around in the dark with it.

of course I found a way around it and learned a new form of perception which was unable to be taken away whenever the do what they do to remove the effects the star watching has on me. I still notice, for example, a dramatic difference betwen how often these chaotic sort of situations arise, for example, after I wake up or after I watch stars.

---

so, it seems that what I am now falling victim to the very opposite thing of what I believe will make this program actually work. I'm sure I'll find a way around it, but before that, I want to mention something. I received a comment on my comment on the video. it was likely a nosebook person[^3]. he said, "Yeah what is random anyway? Especially when generated by computer.." random generated by a computer is not random, so it lead me to respond:

```
@Kuno Vdp you're mixing two different things. a pseudorandom number generator is where the computer does repeatable permutation on its state to generate a less predictable result. these random number generators are seeded with an initial state. what rupert is talking about is "true random". this can be achieved quite easily and if you've ever worked with electronics, it's called "noise". nose is hard to be eliminated because it's impossible to predict. it comes from a whole bunch of external forces (electromagnetic signals) to generate those random signals.

however, if you were capable of knowing all of the electromagnetic signals in your environment and have knowledge about the composition of the receiving "antenna" for these signals, then it wouldn't be random at all. in fact, it would be perfectly predictable. given the state of the environment (conditions and composition) + knowledge of the receiver (its condition and attributes) then, it could be predicted.

---

after thinking about that, that means that chickens have a way of electromagnetically affecting its environment in a way which will produce more favourable results in the random number's receiver system so that the robot spends more time near the chicken.
```

I enjoyed that response because it allowed me to show that a PRNG is not the same as a RNG. however, from the perspective of source, what we would consider a RNG, actually appears to them like a PRNG.

when I concluded the response by saying that the chicken is capable of emitting electromagnetic signals to affect the noise generated on the RNG so that it intelligently chooses one direction more than the other. you could think to yourself perhaps the chicken has no conscious capability of affecting the exact electromagnetic signals in order to affect that outcome. true, however, the chicken has desire to be with the robot which it thinks is it's mom. desire has a chance to improve favourable probabilites for the outcome.

you notice this with "streamer luck" as well. simply put, there is more desire for the streamer to do well in the game, so they find themselves more often in favourable situations and outcomes.

---

the opposite thing is happening to me. it appears that my desire to make this program is less now than nosebook's desire for me to *not* have this program out. their dedire is creating favourable (for them) difficulty in my own interactions with the computer.

just make make desire than them, 4head

I'm working on it[^4] :) I just wanted to write about the irony of using very thing that this program is built on, to try and present it's effectiveness.

I also don't understand why nosebook would have such strong desire in opposition to the program. it's very very unlikely that their own brain interfaces that their programmers use (and the guy making the motor sounds uses) will ever be given a public interface to use, meaning that if you want to read electrical signals in your head, you're going to have to drill a hole in your skull. this way allows for the interface of the human to the machine in a way that is non-invasive (no skull drilling or complex instruments necessary), so that way nosebook can keep all of their brain interface and mind reading stuff a secret. additionally, since they are already correlating our brain signals to certain stimulus like sight, hearing, speaking words, etc. -- now they'd have even another way to correlate brain signals to real tangible concepts and actions that are happening "randomly" as a result of our desire to influence the machine in different ways to perform tasks.

I'll figure it out :) I always do

[1]: she left on a particularly angry note telling me I was not a good programmer.

[2]: just in case you're wondering, evidence of this "curse" was apparent even before I became aware of it after rupert's mention of the idea.

[3]: most certainly they have advised everyone to not interact with me for fear that it may spawn an interaction that's out of their control

[4]: I'm also letting desire build by giving my attention to unwanted for a bit. I'm capable of turning toward wanted quite easily now...


### 2019-08-01 01:54 - things are getting nuttier and nuttier

last night when I was out watching stars I was thinking about how ridiculous things are getting, and it's largely because every time I release resistance to an idea, a bigger one comes. in addition to that I have an understanding that as I release more and more resistance, I'll be essentially living a dream-like experience.

the reason why we're not all living dream-like experiences, is because we have resistance to things, like dying and other stuff -- so, we don't really live as freely as we would if we were dreaming. when I dream, almost always I have an overwhelming sense that no matter what, things are ok. seems obvious right, cause I guess deep down you know you'll just wake up. well, that's where the fear of death and preservation instincts help us to create resistance which prevents us from experiencing a dream-like experience.

---

so then, almost as if to prove myself right, following immediately after that realisation that I'm just releasing all resistance, this idea pops into my head where I consider the idea that lyia has -- wait wait, I have to go back further.. quite a while back when I was beginning to understand the whole time splitting thing, I originally postulated that nearly all of these other relationship scenarios were in fact successful, however, from the vantage point of the successful timeline, why stop there? why not intentionally sabotage the timeline so that the relationship never happens, contrast grows even higher and a new opportunity is formed.

there may be more than one reason for this, but I think the main reason for this is my desire to find my alignment (get connected), without external influences like sex or drugs or something. I'm pretty sure nosebook has the drugs bit on lockdown such that if I even get close to seeing pretty colours, they induce vomiting, so that's unlikely. the remaining thing is obviously using sex to find it. I find it pretty likely that nosebook is constantly trying to make plans to see to try and make the sex thing happen before I get connected.

the secondary reason why I think these alternate (failing) timelines are sabotaging this one is because the people deciding to sabotage the relationship could instead ride along in a different body and experience the same thing from a different vantage point in a younger more desirable body[^1] (or the same vantage point if you aren't a part of the sabotage). so, I imagine that it'll turn out to be pretty mind blowing. so, from their perspective (of one of the timelines where I find my alignment from sex), why not just go bigger and experience it all again?

you could imagine that this will always be the case because things grow bigger and bigger every time, so everyone on the planet, I imagine would set things up so that their circumstances may be more contrast, but are much more favourable toward the end of the timeline.

the timeline has to end at some point and that has been the subject of other discussions, but I perceive it to be when I make my transition into a multi-bodied experience. it is the ultimate in trading speed for acceleration, and it also prevents me from being able to build timeline technology -- instead, I imagine that some time in the future, some of my new bodies will discover it. who knows when that'll be. it may be a while, and depending on how much of an energetic effect I have on the world, we may take a bit of a dip, like potentially 1177BC kind of dip. I'm not sure.

ok, so back to where I was, I had postulated that it was likely that raquel perhaps could by riding along in the body of lyia. I didn't find that to be such a stretch, considering the similarity to the attraction toward the gnomitos plan.

well, last night the idea that popped into my head was actually that, and to prove my point, it's likely that nosebook has come up with another plan to force the sex issue, which created a new timeline which will sabotage this one and lyia is riding along in another body now.

the idea seemed ok to me, and at this point, I have such little control over what's happening, I just go with the flow of everything now. let's say that nosebook put that idea in my head to kind of disrupt things, because of the conclusion that I came to the other day where I was imagining what I would do if I could possibly begin flying. I postulated that I would go to visit lyia and take a small break star watching in the sahara and psicodelice mushrooms.

I guess we'll just have to find out how far all of this goes... it's gonna be a wild ride.

[1]: for example, at nosebook, some of the employees (and I'm thinking more specifically about landscape architect guy), that he might possibly think to himself, "man my boss is *exactly* like me, except I'm more crafty and manipulative, and he's more direct and commanding" for example...


### 2019-08-02 12:29 - landscape architect guy

I feel inclined to write something about him, because he's sort of been a lot on my mind since I had that note I wanted to add to the previous entry. I wanted to shed some light on some things that have become apparent to me.

I think the technology does exactly what you would imagine it to do, in that you can manipulate your way into positions of greatness. however, in my case I don't beieve that I have been manipulating conditions to get where I'm at. I've been letting LOA do the manipulation for me. so, it may seem like you're an improved version of whoever the boss guy because you're more crafty and cunning, yet I imagine that if you were to ask your boss how he got to his position of power, it was likely the same way: through some sort of manipulation.

I was reminded various times through the night about similar experiences that I had as a kid. my father named me "kenneth" because he told me that God explained that I would always have a tug-of-war between "being fair in the sight of God vs. bing fair in the sight of man." I was keenly aware of other people and I had a sensitivity to where I could easily feel other's reactions to what I was saying. I'm pretty sure that crusty (train sounds guy) is fairly sensitive to others as well, but I know that (I'll call him for short) LAG is sensitive other people's reactions, too. when he gets up in the trees segment, abraham interrupts him and says, "don't just start rambling" -- and the reason for that, if he was anything like me, was he would just throw a bunch of stuff out there fishing (likely from the women) for a positive reaction to some of his buzzwords. abraham throws him off a bit with that one, so he tries out a probably tried and true buzzword about being really "present" -- to which abraham calls him out on it again saying that they don't really find him as present as he thinks he is. (he's clearly very concerned with how people (mostly the women) in the room are responding to him)

another key moment for me was when he says to abraham, as if to kind of dispel the negative image that I was painting about nosebook by saying something like, "and you know abraham we're not like *that*". abraham does't respond, neither confirming or denyint what he said. they might have shook their head, but I only had an audio recording of it.

basically this guy is like me when I was really young -- like say 10-11yo. I used to be kind of crafty and manipulative when I was a kid because I was so much smarter than everyone else. however some notable things happened in my life which quelled that behaviour (because my father had named me the way he did):

1. I felt it was necessary to tell bring dad's attention to the power manipulation strategies of gordon's church. I felt in this case by "ratting someone out" I was fulfilling my service to being fair in the sight of God, by decreasing my fairness in the sight of the power structure ruling over our family at the time.

2. when I was younger I decided I didn't want to be popular. I found it really easy to be the popular kid and well approved by others, but it had its cost, because I was now a servant to the opinion of those around me which make me popular. I instead chose to do what I wanted to do.

3. I can't remember this exact instance very well, but one time I lied about how I was doing things to help people, yet at the same time I was taking advantage of the situation in some way. it turned out that some fortunate circumstances came about where I was attributed with the good fortune, and I was forced to say yes, I intended for that to happen to maintain my positive image. this (unfortunately) solidified my direction toward positive behaviour in order to maintain me image.

---

none of these are very good smoking gun of what has made me the person I am today, but what I wanted to illustrate is that I was very much more concerned about other's opinion of me than I am now.

I was thinking about that final 3rd situation a bit last night and I've kind of come to the conclusion that this is all perfectly fine. my future self has "manipulated" the timeline in such a way that I would have to learn to become dependent on letting LOA do all of the "manipulation" for me. LAG's future self has probably set things up in such a way where he seemed to me in the right place and the right time and said the right thing to throw his weight around in just the right way to get what he wants by using some form of manipulation.

this means he'll grow into his future position thinking that's just how it's done: you have to manipulate your way to the top. so, while the crusty old guy he'll replace soon is a lot more resistant, it won't be obvious for a few more years into the future where other young hotshots are vying for his position how he became that way... it's probably not a good idea to repeat crusty's overbearing command to try and protect his power position, so maybe, and I recommend this because it's what "saved" me, is to maintain the positive image even if it means being forced to go the "good way" in order to maintain others' positive opinion of you (2nd situation). being a slave to the opinion of other's may produce a situation similar to the 3rd situation, and he may get there by reenacting the 1st situation.

I have no idea how it'll all go, but I'd like to take a moment and speculate on it. I'm sure that it'll all be fine, it's just that I'm beginning to see it all in a wider perspective now.

this guy's main drive is wanting so much to appeal to the women and maintain a positive appearance with them (remember his compost comment?), and so I imagine that he'll probably want to position things in such a way to where he looks like some sort of saviour to them by (finally) allowing something that they want. the vibrational signature of this feeling isn't exactly that, it's more to do with finally allowing people to do what they with their own bodies in exchange for a chance to have more sexy time with the assuredly millions of women that want to reward him for his decision, and I think that kind of sets him with a precedent of doing that sort of thing, so he'll have to keep doing it (or maybe he doesn't want to more and more as he gets old and crusty, who knows).


### 2019-08-02 20:19 - number concepts

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xauCQpnbNAM)

just watched that video which got me thinking quite a bit. in the video she asked how to describe numbers without using the word number or quantity or amount, to illuminate the idea that numbers are conceptual. the thing that popped into my mind was cell division.

if you start with one cell, it divides into two. then, at some point in time those two become four cells. it doesn't happen at *exactly* the same time though, so for some small portion of time you will have three cells. it'll spend a lot of time at four cells, and further on... it occurs to me that the *number* of cells that exists at any moment in time will almost always never be a prime number (unless you count two as prime). meaning, that if we were able to count the cells in an organism, it would almost never have a prime number of cells. I thought that was an interesting idea that came out of the discussion.

however, the real eye-opener for me was when I began to think about russel's paradox. I wrote:

```
I think it's kind of a silly question because if you reverse the logic and ask yourself, "is the set of all sets which are members of itself, also not a member of itself?"

what I mean is if you think of all of the things that are members of itself, like all things that are not turtles, is also not a turtle. so, if you imagine all of the things that are not a thing, it cannot be a thing (a member of itself). this sort of logic doesn't provide any benefit to the discussion, whereas understanding that numbers are rooted in the concepts is a huge development for what we call singular consciousness. eg. are you a person or 37.2 trillion cells? the dividing line is conceptual.

to illustrate the idea, imagine that you had the capability of perceiving something from all possible angles at once. what exactly would you be looking at? everything we look at is a bunch of things inside of a thing (a parent concept composed of many sub-concepts). so, when you wanted to look at something, imagine that to be able to see something, your own definition of that concept forms the basis of your perception or vision.
```

the last bit being the most important of it all. I've given quite a lot of thought to the idea of where you say that is one thing or concept -- when in actuality that thing or concept is composed of many parts, and the perceiver (observer) of the concept is the one who defines it as some thing.

I found this video to be a strangely enlightening encounter in light of my present transition into becoming conscious on the conceptual or emotional plane. I have seen it before briefly where I was able to perceive things inwardly, where I could see myself from all angles at once, or at least the ones that were relevant to me, so for example I didn't see the bottom of my feet, cause that wasn't relevant to my perception of myself.

this confused me for quite some time, because I couldn't figure out where the thing I was looking at began and ended, so I was unsure of the mechanics of how this sort of perception worked, because how did it know which part of me is me and not the world.

a similar problem existed for the idea of translocation -- an idea that isn't new at all. it exists in the bible, nancy has talked about it, and I've also heard of it from ramtha. just like the 5d vision, I can understand the light bounces and can understand it works mechanically, but just the same as this one, how do I know where the thing begins and ends? if I wanted to translocate/teleport to some other location, why do I not arrive without any clothes on? how does this teleportation occur[^1]? how does it know where me begins and me ends, and that my clothes are a part of me?

sorry, so going back I understand how it works mechanically in the sense that if I have strong desire to be in a different location than the one I'm in now, and I don't have any resistance to me being in that location, I *should* find myself in that location. it's a law of the universe. so I get the desire part, but I didn't get the conceptual part of how to define what composes the thing that is going to be teleported.

oh, and going back further, I also knew that this 5d view of seeing things from all angles at once was the inward view, so there should be an outward view as well. I should be able to see everything around me all at once much like the sun does. because of this I have often postulated that in 4d, there should also be an inner view where I can go inside my imagination and create the world in which I am existing for that moment. I read about this with andy pero (project superman), and it seems like I had experienced it a few times as well.

of additional note, when I became conscious on the astral plane (I should be conscious in my dreams when my imagination exists around me), I found out that I began to have power over the world around me, and this enabled flight and movement of objects with my mind.

---

I believe that this new form of perception will allow me to travel about conceptually anywhere within the concept that I exist within. somehow it all relates to multi-bodied experience as well.

the last thing that I wanted to mention is that I have begun to notice a new pattern. I have noticed that I began with very little little resistance on the astral (6th), source (4th), and relational (2nd) transition planes, yet it seems like I'm gaining resistance on them. meanwhile, on the primary planes, notably conceptual (5th), logical (3rd) and desire (1st) planes, I've been releasing resistance on them in order to be able to perceive them more clearly.

this makes perfect sense now on hindsight, because quite simply, I don't want to be aware of the millions of interactions and relations that are happening around me, so I'm gaining resistance there and becoming more self-focused. on the astral plane, I'm gaining all sorts of resistance there because I don't really want to be nosebook's puppet through my dream state, and otherwise if I didn't increase resistance there, I would be so mind blown my the infinite number of creations and creativity there, the open-endedness of it all would be such a mind-blowing experience, I would be a (barely) walking acid-trip otherwise. then, on the source plane, as I begin to perceive things conceptually (all relevant angles at the same time), it makes perfect sense that I don't want to be having anyone and everyone's full experience at the same time, it would be such overload, I would become the next universe if it were to all happen at once.

I just thought that was interesting that the three transition planes are meant to build resistance on to perceive them more effectively, and the four primary planes are meant to release resistance on, and I just wanted to share that :)

[1]: my very first thought investigation happened with a movie that seemed to be on nearly once a week on tbs or tnt (I can't remember now) called "the fly" with jeff goldblum. in the movie, he gets into a teleporter which deconstructs him and all of his atoms and then reassembles them at another location. cept, a fly gets in there with him so he becomes like a fly-human mutant. this awful awful movie provided me with endless hours of thought on how teleportation works and where exactly does "you" exist.


### 2019-08-05 16:33 - scientific doozie

I was thinking to myself either yesterday morning or this morning, that, cause I've been paying attention lately to how quickly water evaporates, the difference in the feeling of the air when water evaporates quicker. some nights I've seen it evaporate in 1-2 hours (without wind), what normally takes all night long to evaporate, and even still I often still see water in thte gutter the next morning after the sun has risen (after say 5-6 hours 7-9hrs of nighttime). it's not a scientific study, but I'm sure that water does not evaporate at a constant rate.

the modulator for the evaporation rate seems to be what I've termed air conductivity. I don't have a measurement for it, but I noticed that when when I first came to colorado, when I would stay under the covers and it would heat up really hot, in spain, I just felt like I was inside of a hot place. however, here in colorado, I've noticed that the heat is actually painful and stingy feeling. when I have noticed this effect, I have also seen a correlation to the sky being ultra crystal clear (when there are no clouds), and the stars seem to have a brilliance that is very noticeable in my eyes; they seem to be extra polished or something, as if they have a halo of colour.

the other thing I noticed was that the sun feels especially hot. it's almost as if it's this searing heat that is much more noticable than typical sunlight like I was used to in spain. in spain, I would sit out in the sun for hours because the sunlight felt so soft and comforting to me. in the summer it was kinda harsh but it mostly just felt extremely hot and didn't have that stinging feeling to it like here in colorado.

---

so, it occured to me that if gerald's supposition in @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnwAUVNhU0s) is right: he claims that the wind is driven by water evaporation, which is driven by sunlight, and that the wind's pressure exerted on land features actually rotates the planet. perhaps, with all of the clouds blocking the sunlight the earth is actually spinning slightly slower.

then, it hit me, "oh, this is a way that the sun can modulate the speed which the earth spins."

in a previous entry (@[entry](2019-04-24 08:57) and @[entry](2019-04-24 18:38)), I postulated that this increase in air conductivity actually increases the speed of light[^1].

when I was with with raquel, I noticed that nearly every time that we had sex, the sky could be perfectly clear out, but then after sex, there seemed to be a whole bunch of airplanes that came and put lines in the sky. additionally, I notice that the mornings after I watch stars, the seem to need to run a bunch of cloud lines, hoo. even moreso after I stare into the sun for sunrise.

---

so then, it hit me after a few recent realisations, cause on s0's morning news, he always puts the windmaps of pressure and precipitation forcasts before closing out the news, and for the last 6 months or so, india has been in constant low pressure, and additionally, since I've been taking star watching really seriously (maybe since february), there has been a permanent high pressure spot over where I live and up the rockies into the springs or denver.

ben also explained a few weeks back that low pressure systems are sucking wind down out of the jetstream down to cloud level (spiraling inward), and high pressure (earth) spots push air upward (spiraling outward).

it seems to me that low pressure systems will dampen the effect the wind has on the rotation of the earth (by pulling air inward) and high pressure systems will exacerbate it (by pushing wind outward).

it seemed obvious to me after connecting those ideas together that energetic atcivites like sex or star watching have a large effect on the spin of the earth, and likely they are attempting to keep things at normal levels by holding large portions of the earth at low pressure to offset increasing rotation speeds[^2].

this means that the sun and also the earth wants the earth to rotate more rapidly, and so just like how they're interacting with me, they don't want me to increase my energy output, so they're artificially holding me at a lower speed just like they are the planet.

---

let's just let them continue to keep trying to hold on to the "business as usual" attitude. it seems to me that likely they'll just keep trying to hold this back for so long that eventually, the planet will win, and we'll begin rotating much *much* quicker, the air will be much more energetic, and it'll probably enable things like flight for most of us (at least the kids anyway).

I guarantee they won't do a 180° turnaround on this one, because it's sort of one of those things where how would you explain to the entire scientific community those sorts of critical things need to be kept a secret. at some point in time, it'll become so obvious, that it'll be difficult to continue to blame carbon and climate change.

so, just hang on tight and let them continue to keep trying to keep things under control. the reward at the end is going to be *sooo* worth it!

[1]: there is a definite correlation between this air conductivity and also LOA as well, but that's the subject of another entry. I also seem to be *much* more likely to produce images in my eyes, and a few imes in spain I was able to conjure images or energetic sparkles in 3d space.

[2]: I remember last week (2 weeks ago?) when ben said that there was a strange wavy jetstream for this time of year which would bring record cold to the united states. a few minutes later windy showed the entire US covered in low pressure cyan colour, cept for where I live :) (TODO: find the reference)


### 2019-08-07 19:52 - the new 1%

this morning, I was talking with jaron about a principal that I have noticed in the evolution of consciousness.. I've been calling it "trading speed for acceleration" and I didn't really have any good examples as to how this works, but jaron offered the suggestion of the stock market as an example, and I like it. since, I have come up with another example: my eyesight. the premise is that for every dip in the stock market, the long-term growth that comes from the bounceback is actually greater than if the market had continued to grow at its previous rate.

the same thing seems to occur with my eyes. when I first started out, I would look at the sun and it caused huge amounts of damage to my eyes, however over time they healed and let's say after a year, even though they were damaged, I see better out of them after a year than I would have, if I didn't look at the sun. nowadays, I look at the sun nearly every day, and it seems like my eyes are healing as fast as I can damage them. so here's where the stock market example falls apart because my eyesight is gaining more detail faster than I can damage my eyes. consider that every time I damage my eyes, they always come back stronger[^1].

---

that was the setup, then I followed up by saying that I think that the sorts of situations where there is a "crash" are actually a good thing. let's take basic economics for example. there are rich people and there are poor people and this has existed throughout time, but without a doubt, the quality of life has been improving for everyone. 300 years ago, if you were really poor, you had a really awful quality of life, however, the richest of the rich people from 300 years ago do not have arguably much higher quality of life than a middle-class american these days.

economic superiority has diminishing returns to it in the bigger scheme of things, because it seems that trend toward increasing quality of life for everyone on the planet is in full effect and will continue to happen. because of this, I am convinced that monetary systems will have some coming changes to accommodate for these diminishing returns. when "poor" people have a similar quality of life to rich people in a physical sense, such as house, food, clothes, etc. a new system of superior quality of life will need to be made.

I think this is where human vision comes in. I have demonstrated that your eyesight can be improved permanently and this is done by releasing resistant ideas. you can improve it temporarily by doing drugs or I'm sure nosebook has developed a way to overclock people's eyesight for them, and likely they have techniques to reduce the psychedelic factor to it, meaning that instead of releasing resistance to things that slow down your eyesight, they probably just do like they're doing to me, which is forcing the brain to only run at the awake and alert state, so that no outside hallucinations come in. they may have other things too.

anyway, I've already talked about how I think that the earth is gradually increasing its energetic output, so that means that all across the planet people's visual quality will begin to improve. because I believe that superior physical experience (vision, touch, sound) is going to be replacing economic superiority, this means that nosebook is going to have to try and find a way to outpace the rest of the planet to maintain their superiority.

I don't believe that'll happen, so they'll do what is a common response amongst these types of "bullies" -- instead, they'll try hold their competition at a lower level than them. as I have mentioned in previous entries, I do not believe it's possible for them to be able to hold people physically lower like they are doing to me. it's just way impossible in so many different ways.

so, then that means that we need to take a look at the rate at which the planet is increasing its energetic output. there are not likely any numbers on this out in the public domain, because they're probably a pretty big secret, however, my own anecdotal experience seems to imply that my star watching has a tremendous effect on it. think there are other points in time where this energy has risen to quite high levels before, as well. examples being, the week before the deluge, the tower of babel, the height of egypt (before the exodus), the height of the roman empire, tesla's colorado springs experiments before WWI, and finally wardenclyfe before WWII.

in all of those examples, I believe that previous to the catastrophic events which followed, there was a sharp rise in human perception from some external source[^2], and very similar to a psychedelic experience, when perception is extended further than the human mind is capable of, it'll become a very enlightening experience or a very aggitating experience if the mind still has resistant thought. what I'm basically saying is that the most powerful psychedelic is created by ouwr brain, and external stimulus can excite that, such that everyone on the planet is essentially on drugs. then, when the stimulus goes away, the comedown begins.

so, how does all of this fit together? well, I believe the new 1% will be the privileged few who "hoard" the enriched physical experience to theirselves, relying on their external sources to maintain their superiority.

what that means is that 99% of the people will be treated like I am now. jaron said that he doubts that many people will respond like I do, where it pushes me to go further, but I remind you that a long time ago, you had to be a king or royalty to enjoy a quality of life experience about equal to what we would now consider to be a low quality of life experience. nowadays, not only kings and rulers han enjoy a high quality of life, there are easily thousands of times more people today that are enjoying a better quality of life experience than there were then -- and that number will continue to rise to be nearly everyone in a very short period of time (100 years?).

I think the same thing will happen with the detail level of human experience. right now, very few people see things as good as I do, but without taking into account what I'm about to say, I would imagine that around the next time of the next change (I've called this capricorn), the next 1% will have vision similar to mine is now and the rest will be at a much lower quality level (which is still considerably higher than the detail level of anyone today).

---

however, and I think this is the main difference between the previous examples I gave any what is likely to be happening in the future...

sure nosebook will do their whole superiority thing and all of that stuff and that'll build stronger desire, so just see it like a stock market crash in the sense that it only looks disastrous if you see it in a 1yr timescale. if you look at it over 20 or even 50 years timescale, it's barely even noticeable.

what I think the main difference is that this time there won't be such a large dip. it'll feel big, because I imagine that before my departure, my influence will be enormous, however so will the girls (and all of the other girls out there that share in their experience). I just don't believe that it'll be possible to hold this sort of thing back.

a lot of things may happen, but you can imagine that if suddenly low-resistance circular minded people all of a sudden had a huge improvement to their physical experience (sight, sound, touch, etc.), first of all, it would create lots of desire in the square minded people to have the same capability, but do you think that nosebook would still hold back the square minded people, to maintain their superiority?

right, so what happens after my departure? probably not a whole lot. I'm really hoping that the energy output of the girls will be high enough that very little effect could be felt or even a near immediate improvement following -- much like how I can stare into the sun now and walk away seeing better than before.

[1]: maybe a similar idea to this would be if you were lifting weights, and every pump, you got immediately stronger. at first only slightly stronger, but after a few years like me, imagine if every time you lifted weights, you could lift 1% more than the last time, and the following year, every time you lifted, you could lift 2% more than the previous day... something like that.

[2]: deluge was a huge CME from saturn, tower of babel was an enormous tower (receiver) that did something similar to the giza pyramids with knowledge that has been lost, since. the fall of the egyptian empire was the removal of the ark from the great pyramid and venus' effect on the planet, the fall of the roman empire came as a result of a reduction in perceptive capabilities since jesus' death, and therefore a return back to primate like behaviour. tesla states in many places he tried to awaken the energy in the air (also I believe this is how he got his "fractions of a percent" wireless transmission efficiency and also the reason why the 1940s were the hottest (recorded) temperatures we've had in the US).


### 2019-08-08 12:52 - reactions to yesterday's entry

later, after I wrote the entry, I had a strong impression in my mind, to the effect of, no we don't want you to depart. I responded in a strange way saying, "you guys really don't want me to go?" (as if I were replying to nosebook). it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me why they would want me to stay, because there are (in my opinion) many many more problems for them if I stay than if I go.

I really want to do the multi-bodied thing. that's kind of the mot important part for me. today reading some of tesla's old interviews, I see that he struggles with the difficulty that he's only one person, and to try and he tried in so many different ways, to communicate his perception to others, but it was of no use. people just couldn't see things the way he did -- and even still, I recognise that even with all of you able to see things the way I see them, it does very little to actually communicate the feeling or the reason behind those impressions.

it only strengthens my desire more to have a multi-bodied experience, because instead of trying to use a physical apparatus or some visual technique to get others on my same wavelength and communicate the idea, instead "I" can impart that feeling into various different bodies and have them each interpret and translate that feeling the way they they best are capable of.

I really like the idea of the challenge associated with learning the different perspectives of each body in relation to the same feeling. this seems quite like something I want to be doing.

---

I hadn't really put the pieces together yet realising that it was nosebook making the reaction until today, but it started making sense to me when the next thing I felt yesterday was something of despair. today, that despair transformed into a general feeling of depression like the thing wasn't going to happen. imagine that I'm really ahead of my time and the whole gnomitos thing is actually for a time when nosebook has chilled out a lot. instead, this time is just going to be a bit of a long and drawn out fail to continue to build stronger desire.

I mean I can see it sorta. it even makes logical sense in the idea that if you take the idea that the next era (capricorn) is the "summer" or the peak of the sinewave, such that capricorn is the peak of the square energy, and from there onward, the square[^1] energy begins to become overtaken by circle energy and we begin to see the world transform into a global village where once again women provide the direction for this global village.

it's true that it doesn't really appear like that kind of environment is the one we are experiencing right now... kinda, well maybe not. I mean it very well could be, and this is the square's last hurrah before being overtaken by a new form of perception. I don't really want to claim it's one way or the other, because I think that's silly to try and do that. instead, I'll just stay focused on what's important for me, and in 20 years, we'll just have to see where things are at.

today I was reading an interview of the reasons why tesla would not marry. I sympethise with his assertions, however even though I understand why he thinks that way (having previously thought similar myself), I think he doesn't see the whole picture as clearly as I do. without any exception the path forward is through empowerment. he concluded with something that really resonated with me:

```
"The power of the true woman is so great that I believe if a beautiful woman--that is to say, one beautiful in spirit, in manner and in thought, in fact, beautiful in every respect, ***a sort of goddess--were to appear suddenly on earth, she could command the whole world. Her leadership, I believe, would be universally recognized.***

"History has given us many examples of the wonderful influence exerted by unusual women. Among these have been the mothers of great men. But their influence lay not in their determination to outdo man, or even to compete with him.
```

(wink, wink)

---

so now, after having given it some more thought and realising that those reactions were coming from nosebook, it seems obvious to me that they seem quite terrified of the whole multi-bodied experience thing. I don't really know why. maybe they think that it'll be something really bad for them, but I don't think it will be at all for them. they will have the kids in their network from day one, and they'll have all the opportunity and capability to try and limit them that is physically possible.

the other thing is that I will make the bold claim that if I were not to depart, and stay here in this body -- if they think they have trouble keeping the climate stable now, they would have really have a problemo on their hands far worse than is happening now -- and I'm not even having sex; just wait till that happens. I really think this is by far the best thing that can happen. additionally, the boys will assuredly gain eyesight similar to mine and will be sexually active with the girls as well, so that'll be the HD sex the dudes are looking for.

I just believe that if I don't divide my energy, things are going to start getting really really nutty. take the curve of my energy output since 2012 and extrapolate that 20 years further. then look at 30. try 100, then realise it should be approaching infinity at a rate which is beyond human comprehension. the reason why I believe this is so, is because I have the compression of many many different timelines to where the one I am traversing now is so compressed with experience that it's pretty unbeatable.

actually, so unbeatable I don't think we'll have something like this occur again until we have timeline technology available to people, so I contemplated this yesterday thinking about this, because I've gained so much experience from all of the difficulties that have occurred on the journey to get to where I am, this is a million times more effective than dna lineage or beneficial circumstances. I believe one of the main things that excites me about this is having a multitude of new contrasting circumstances where each one of them can go through difficulties and gain that kind of experience from different perspectives.

to put it simply, I don't know how I can transfer my bullshit meter to the kids. I don't know if it's even possible. I can only teach them how to use their emotions and let that be their guide. after all, my bullshit meter is sensitivity to my emotions, because I can sense when something's off. so, in that way, nosebook will be able to bamboozle the kids that aren't proficient enough with their emotions, sure -- but (IMO) that's a good thing, because that's how they'll get better at using their emotional guidance system :) that's how I learned anyway: a bunch of people trying to take advantage of me created strong desire in me to learn what I was feeling and to trust it as more real than physical sensation.

I am still not convinced that this is the height of the square energy, and we still have some more time to go before that is the case. I think if nosebook were smart about this, they wouldn't fight it and instead try to embrace some circular energy to prolong their lifetime a bit longer[^2].

[1]: I use square here to refer to the agricultural age when humans stopped being tribal and villagers (hunters and gatherers) and began to make stationary farms, grain warehouses, and stuff like that. this change is the movement into the need to domesticate everything and protect it.

[2]: it just occurred to me that if nosebook is only able to do squares, an attempt to try and do the next thing may spell disaster for them. when I was with marcos, I really believed that affinaty would be succussful if it were to base its content on ideology and beliefs instead of opinions and material posessions. I could see that quite clearly because I was tuning the website toward what had been my experience with woman and more receptive men's reaction to essembly and I had determined this was the right way to go. marcos did not have the same vision as I did, because he hadn't given nearly as much thought as I had to the difference between opinion and belief -- and belief brings people together whereas opinion tends to create sides.

   anyway, he wanted a website more tuned toward the opinion and drama side of things, so we conflicted. I finally gave in and said I would just do it his way. if I had of been smart, I would have not tried to convince him to do it my way. instead, we did kind of a hybrid between both of our perceptions where he wasn't able to easily sell the ideology and belief aspect of the page, so attempting to satisfy my desire to do things differently only crippled him.

   in retrospect, we should have both supported each other's convictions and done both ways. me do my way and he do his way. he would have had a much more success selling it and his users would have been ones that wanted to have opinions. I would have had different users, and they would have been more in line with what I wanted to present to them.

   so actually, while I do believe it would be "smart" for nosebook to embrace what I perceive, after relating this story, I will instead say, that it would be better for them to simply continue to do what they're doing. as long as there are people wanting what nosebook has to offer, they should continue in that way. I believe there is still quite a big market for what nosebook has to offer, and that's perfectly fine.

   actually I'm gonna go a full 180° on this one and say that their lifetime will be prolonged further if they do *not* try and do things differently.


### 2019-08-09 06:39 - multiple personality(?)

this morning I was contemplating an idea that seemed like a good one to think about. I have concluded that it is possible to, extend the multiple bodied idea out further. the main example that came to my mind was imagine how men seem to think that all women have bipolar disorder, where they flip between a very loving and a very resistant personality. I've heard this from numerous men, and I've given it quite some thought, and I think it's a survival mechanism that they have developed, where one side of them deals with the world and the other side is quite resistance free and very delicate. I have postulated that this is attributed to the x chromosome, and is the root of a person's creativity. I have also postulated that this is the mechanism which makes it much easier for women to "channel" -- because they can much easier switch into their non-resistant side.

for men, the x chromosome takes the form of creativity, is quite sensitive emotionally and would be considered the "feminine side" of a man. though, just like a woman can have a more masculine personality, then swap to a very feminine one, this chromosome is a bit of a wild-card in the sense that you make it what you want it to be. most men neglect (and I did too for the first half of my life, until I was about 22-24) their sensitive or emotional side. getting control over this for a man will enable the visual/creative capacity as well.

---

so, here's my idea -- and I have no implementation details on it yet -- just that I'm sure it's possible. imagine that a woman was able to inhabit two different bodies at once just like how I want to do my multiple bodies thing, they would direct both bodies emotionally. right now, the way I feel women when I have tuned myself to their operation, it feels like there is a constant tug-of-war inside of them where it kind of feels like they're going to explode emotionally. they keep their composure and behave appropriately -- sometimes, cause there's always this thing in the back of their head saying, wait what if you were to just do things not the way they're supposed to go.

if you're a creative person you will instantly recognise that feeling. that's the life-force of creativity -- an inventor *MUST* try things out to learn from the results, because often times trying things out like that leads to unexpected results, and soon thereafter a new discovery.

what I'm trying to say is that this bipolar "disorder" that we have called it, is actually the foundation upon which creativity is built. so, here's my plan: allow a woman to have two bodies, such that one represents their "good" side and the other represents their "bad" or experimentative side. each of these two bodies would live separate lives, and the reckless experimenter can go and amass all sorts of contrast.

you see, there's no such thing as "bad" -- so a woman must be allowed to experience both. tesla lamented in his interview why he wouldn't marry that women are neglecting their better, in his opinion, side. the thing is when a woman wants to experience both in the same body, it can cause difficulties, because she cannot easily be both at the same time, so she's forced to choose between the two. some pick the rebelous side and others pick the good side because that's what's expected of them. others even still, decide they will remain the reckless experimenter for their youth, and then once married, switch over to the good side to settle down (and that too has other problems, because the reckless experimenter doesn't want to be shut down like that).

so imagine for a moment that this already exists and andrea is only one half of who she really is. this is just an example, so just go with it. it doesn't reflect anything on the person because this is just an thought experiment a woman can play on herself to unlock her potential -- much like what I did when I was younger with time travel; I'm going somewhere with this. I'll just say she's the reckless experimenter side. that would mean then that there's the other half of her personality is out there in another body. both sides are on a trajectory of self-realisation, so gradually over time the experimenter would come to know what is wanted and generate the physical mechanism to make that happen. this is analogous to saying that she would be developing a masculine (executive) side to her to make that possible. I don't know if that would make a y-cromosome or not, but probably not... so instead of having testosterone flush her brain to generate this mental circuitry, she's doing it consciously.

this would mean xxyy in total, and as a sidenote, similarly I am noticing a duplication of my sides as well. nosebook has one entire hemisphere of mine turned off (the right one, the one associated with emotion and visual/creative). as a result, I've been regaining that capacity by exercising my emotional side on a non-emotional hemisphere. I suppose that would be like me saying I have xxy right now, but when it comes back, my right hemisphere will mirror it, and I'll find myself with xxyy also.

it is my expectation that andrea will eventually come to regain her opposite side as well (because it'll make her feel complete), and instead of these sides warring against each other as so often happens in a woman, her regrown opposite side will be her creation, exactly how she wants it and a product of all of her experimentation (contrast).

now, here's the mental game for that can be played. instead of thinking that she somehow needs to settle down or to try and resurrect her opposite side because of the expectations on a woman that society has or whatever the reason. consider that other side to exist somewhere on the other side of the world living a completely opposite life. this opposite side is focused on what is known to be beneficial and is also generating a executive side to make that a reality.

after some time, both bodies will generate an complementary executive function, one to take what is known to be desired and realise its manifestation physically, and the other side is to take all of the experiments, and distill it down to what is desired and to go in the direction of that.

they are both very similar in the final result, yet they arrived to it from opposite directions -- and the further advantage is that both of them contain more of what is wanted, but neither of them could have arrived to it entirely in a single body.

---

I don't know yet how to implement this physically, but I know that one day it will be possible. until then, a girl as she becomes a woman can just decide what role she wants to play -- and who knows... what if, as you believe it, evidence begins to show up that it's true just like my future self did, and all of a sudden you find yourself having a multi-bodied experience, where one is the dual of the other.


### 2019-08-09 12:48 - an open comment about nancy

yesterday mom confronted me with her reaction to nancy's confrence and we had a somewhat uncomfortable interaction as a result. she complained that nancy isn't growing or changing. it's the same old stories and there's nothing new. I agreed with mom that she had not updated, but I didn't really want to try and figure out what was the underlying desire that I was feeling in that moment. I figured I would give it some thought before mentioning anything.

this morning while I was sitting around enjoying the the cloudy sunrise, my answer came to me, and I decided after getting enough of it in me while sitting there, that I would be able to reload the feeling and relate my thoughts on the matter at a later time with mom (probbly over breakfast). I felt resistance to that so I didn't really try for it. I think it would have actually been counter-productive, so it's a good thing instead to have slept on it..

---

first of all, I think the general motivations are necessary to identify. for quite a few people nancy represents (or symbolises) a strong woman of faith in their mind, and so to see her get kind of stuck is a bit disheartening to them, because they want their female example of a storng woman of faith to gain, not wane in strength. they are looking at what they believe her to be, but not seeing that is what she is: nancy is very head strong and her salvation will only from from her own decisions; she *will* figure it out herself. this letter isn't so much to nancy, but moreso for others to regsain some belief in her again.

you see, she *has* to figure it out for herself because that's what strong women of faith do, so just allow her to do that instead of noticing what's not there. from nancy's perspective, she probably finds it it difficult to do anything other than what she's already been doing, because so many people are noticing and giving their full attention to what she's not doing. when this happens, it can feel like she's being held in a pattern of not being able to do anything other than what people perceive her to be doing because that's what people are noticing. it's hard to go against the grain of what people are noticing and do things your own way :)

nancy is a bit older as well, so the next concern mom voiced to me which likely (most certainly does) represent another common perception of the situation that, and that is that because nancy is so old, it's unlikely that she will make any change now. well, certainly not with that attitude. people have said the same thing about donald trump as well, and even though I'm not up to date on the situation, he does not feel to me 100% stagnant[^1], so I think it's possible that people can update. in nancy's case, I think we'll just have to see. lol

---

whew, now I'd like to mention a few things here. nancy says she's trying to lead people away from religion, and I would argue that this is the centrepoint and the big elephant in the room. religion requires that a whole bunch of people believe in the same thing for there to be any power in it. however, instead of trying to get everyone on the same page -- and, I've noticed that anyone (and right now the US political system and nosebook are the foremost examples of this) who tries to get everyone all on the same page, it seems to be making an endeavour akin to herding cats -- in this way, I have (personally) completely abandoned this style of thought and instead focused on the individual. in this coming age, any one person can only be an example or an inspiration to someone else. we will see a decline in coaching, teaching and mentoring, because people are reaching the point to where even if they have a great teacher, they *must* find their own way toward what they want, and attempts to try and go the old way of the guru or the teacher will ultimately fail[^2].

the salvation from religion is not one of, "ok now I'm going to present a better idea than the last guy, so follow me instead now." -- instead, salvation from religion will come through the empowerment of the individual. this was the original intention of the protestant movement anyway.

---

ok, with the large elephant out of the way now, I'd like to begin talking in a different direction. for me personally, I have learned quite a bit from nancy because of her stories. to me they form a collage of different pictures which give evidence to an underlying principal, and I think an expedition into discovering what that is, should be attempted. you can imagine that jesus had a few different stories/parables that he repeated over and over to the crowds, and lots of people heard those stories and they resonated with them and went home edified, but only sometimes did he reveal the underlying meaning to those stories. I believe he didn't usually reveal the underlying meaning, not because he wanted to hold people in the dark, but because he wanted them to figure it for for theirselves.

in this way, I think this is the most important thing for people following her work to begin recieving, ans as an understanding of what these things are will begin to create something new.

however, it's quite possible that nancy is not even really aware herself of what they may be to her, and it seems possibly that may be the case, with her mention of trying to figure out how to get things to become well understood and repeatable. I estimate the reason why she finds them difficult to be repeatable, is because most examples of these miracles have relied on the power of belief when there are large groups of people all aligned in thought and believing the same thing. the thing is, you just can't do anything about what anyone else believes, and so anyone who wants to gain their stability in making those things repeatable will have to remove any reliance on external belief to do so.

to further illustrate this, if you listen closely to what nancy is relating in her stories, they are all about ignoring what the people around her in these situations believe (satanic nightclub), and focusing inward toward what her own desire is. in fact, these very attributes of her stories are what has allowed so many people to perceive her strength in her self realisation toward whating by ignoring the physical circumstances of the moment (like hungry cannibals or whatever).

---

she'll get it. we just have to give her some space to find it :) she has to find it herself and make it her own, because that is what her identity is. at some point, the resistance will become so great that she'll be forced to go in the direction of what's wanted, but long before that happens, we can all begin to "prepave" her success in our minds by focusing on what it is that we appreciate about her, and only that. I think that if she were to have a radical transformation right now, it would not be well received because of so many of our expectations for her, so perhaps a bit more front-loaded difficulty is in order to soften some of these expectations up a bit. I think it's fine. by appreciating her we release her from these expectations, by only focusing on the parts of her which are appreciable, making those much more of a reality than the other stuff :)

no matter how it goes, I'm sure it'll produce the next realisation of peoples' desire concerning these things.

[1]: I hesitated so much writing that sentence because I have such a plethora of different reactions on the subject, some clearly believe it is the case and others wholeheartedly do not. well, the irony of this trumpism is not lot on me (where you take a taboo or sensitive subject and blast it out of scandal territory by saying something even more uncomfortable or difficult to process... lol) anyway, moving on...

[2]: I've given lots of thought as to why this is so, and I don't really have a good reason as to why that is the case, but I think we've all been misguided enough times be people with something to gain from their agenda, that the human psyche may be beginning to reject this sort of thing. it's also a return back to more childlike behaviour. ever notice how there is a pattern in what we would identify in successful people when they were kids, they wanted to try it and do it for theirselves, and they didn't want some adult to just do it for them.


### 2019-08-11 11:34 - feelings and hallucinations

I was just having an internal dialogue with myself on some reactions to some people realising that they have no idea how women work (in light of some things I mentioned in previous entries).

I mentioned that probably the easiest way to begin actually learning about this would be for the programmers at nosebook to first try and see if the system can recognise their own feelings. this is obviously because very few people can actually tell you what they feel in an accurate way, so the only real way to know if your system has any validity to it would be to try it on yourself and see how good it is. "who knows," I said, "maybe you'll actually learn something about your emotions."[^1]

so to follow it up, I said maybe they could think of a woman more like you think of "multi-programming" @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB0yDMQj1lU) -- where you can think of it like two or more dudes occupying the same space. however, consciousness like a CPU can only allow one thing to execute at a time, so then there are these interrupts which interrupt conscious execution and swap in another process from the ready to run pool. the mechanism by which they make make their switch isn't really important, because it has to do with a lot of different environment and mental triggers.

the important thing to try and figure out is which process is running. that creates a challenge though because you couldn't really know what process is running unless you were able to perceive the world like I do. when I say "perceive" -- I mean, "feel about the world" the same way I do.

nosebook already has begun to develop the capability to do that. in other entries I have talked about how the emotions of the person are encoded at very high frequencies into the eyesight of the person. with my vision now being only a lower quality version of what my eyes see projected into the retina, I am seeing only physical colours and shapes, and it's not combined with the way I feel, so almost everything looks kind of bland and lifeless to me. if I were depressed, everything would dreary and awful -- and if I were feeling pretty good, everything would look alive and wonderful.

---

so what they need is to continue improving on that technology until it's so high definition that everyone is literally able to see things how I perceive them to be. I believe that because of signal distortions and attenuation of extremely high frequencies, people probably perceive things things, not quite as good as I would see them :) I'm quite sure that ramping people's brain up to see things the way I see them will also cause hallucinations as well, and those hallucinations are actually slight differences (incompatibilities) between our mental models of the world. they're like rough patches in the person's perception (emotional outlook on the world), which when stimulated, create a mental manifestation inside of the eyes, just like how if I were able to see through my eyes, I would be able to see the manifestations my emotions make in my eyes, too.

so, by removing the hallucinations, nosebook is artificially removing the manifestations these points of resistance are creating, allowing people to see things more and more like I do. this is really good, because this is the technology we're looking for. it has some caveats as well which I'll talk about in the next section, but overall, things are quite good.

---

imagine now this perception signal as "key" to the person's perception. if you were able to remove all of your own perception, and just allow theirs through, it allows someone to perceive the world exactly like the other person does.

a way to think about this, the way I have experienced it to be, that perception signal would be analogous to the hidden emotional/creative side of a person. men traditionally only have one of these in operation, but I am evidence that a man can have two (both my right and left hemispheres have this visual creative capacity now). woman also have two of these and their logic function is generated consciously instead of by having testosterone do the work (as is the case in men).

what nosebook has been doing is they have been training their AIs to pattern match on the executive, logical, or linguistic side of the brain, because it operates in a very linear and discrete fashion. the other side which is traditionally located in the right hemisphere (the one they have disabled), does not work linearly. it seems to be capable of doing many things at once and works with abstract or frequencially similar concepts/feelings. in my brain, in order to combat my utilisation of that other side, they are trying to shut it down, and it's likely because the more I use that abstract perceptive side, my vision improves. my vision improving is just the physical manifestation of my mental model of the world is now able to process more information more rapidly.

so, let's recap: think of human visual capacity as a physical manifestation of the way someone emotionally perceives the world. both men and woman have two (or more), but traditionally, men are only aware of their linear interpretation, and neglect or shut down their emotional form of perception. traditionally women are perceive the world through two, usually opposite, emotional systems of perception and their executive or linear interpretation of it is learned as they grow up. usually for a woman, one of the sides is active most of the time and the other side is usually protected or repressed because it doesn't have a highly enough linear interpreter (executive capability) to be able to operate in a male-dominated world.

it is very uncommon for me to find another man who is developing his other side. I have noticed that men tend to be more physical, so men who are ambidextrous, tend to have both sides more developed. notable mentions are I noticed this frequently in jerry, as he did a lot of circus stuff so he learned a lot of things on both sides. I also find it interesting that I spent a lot of time with luke who also has both of his sides more developed than most. tesla also mentions that he later learned to become ambidextrous. (and, if you'll notice, all of the those examples are people who primarily utilise their left-hand)

(to be continued)

[1]: this produced a reaction to the effect of, it's hopeless/demotivating to discover new things because no real beneficial implementation can be made of it, because we're just to do what we're told to do.


### 2019-08-11 - more thoughts on feelings and hallucinations

so imagine that someone is improving their eyesight by perceiving the world like I perceive it, this works really well as a temporary thing, sort of like drugs do a similar thing: for a brief period of time the drug allows someone to perceive the world slightly differently, and for example that can make the drug "user" feel better -- but, it's not something that should be continued indefinitely. nosebook's removal of hallucinations is a similar such thing, in that it shouldn't be used for extended periods of time, because the same thing happens after coming down from a high.. if nosebook's system were to ever go away, I think it'll be quite fine because I see two possible outcomes from it. the first the return back to a person's normal form of perception would be quick (just like a dream wears off in about a few seconds), however, just like a dream as well, you'll be able to remember the general details of the dream, and probably how it used to look, so I estimate that it'll create enough desire that quite a few people will find a way to get back there. I think that's the most likely outcome. if it takes some time for the brain to adjust back to its previous form of perception, all that will occur will be hallucinations for a little bit, but once a person is able to get them under control, they'll have a visual creative capacity.

both outcomes also have the added advantage that people will no longer be having their perception forced to be like mine, so many new pathways will be created as (in the second case) everyone finds their own way to perceive at that higher speed and not hallucinate (eg. resistance in their mental model do not become manifest in their experience), or as they return back (in the first case) to perceiving that speed, they'll do it their own individual way. I'm sure that there are infinite ways to perceive the world which can yield vision like mine, and I would be quite a bit saddened if everyone in the world perceived the world exactly like I do. I really like the idea of being an example for many to find their own way, and what greatly excites me about the whole gmomitos project is the idea that I would be able experience life from a multitude of *different* perspectives.

there are a few unseen things that I'm not sure about. first, it may be possible that there will be other dudes who's form of perception is used by others, and second I imagine that quite a few of the girls will actually discover their own as well. it may even be possible that some of them join me in 5d as well. what this could mean is that for women, nosebook may be forced to kind of divide up the girls and put the more similar people into their forms of perception (instead of using mine, cause mine may become a bit too mind blowing)...

so, I don't really know what the future is, but if I'm in 5d, it seems pretty unlikely that they'll continue to put people on mine, so they'll have to go for the next best one that they can sell. this is still a huge boost for all of humankind, and I think it's quite an interesting thing that'll happen as a result.

---

lastly, I'm sure that some people may be wondering why would I ever help out nosebook figure out more of how we operate? I think the answer for me is simple: it doesn't inhibit anything. I have given the example of the tempter eating the dust of the earth, and also I would like to additionally give the example of my own life where every time that nosebook has disabled a part of my brain or tried to force me into something, it has only made me considerably stronger.

I'm actually very sure that if it weren't for nosebook removing my hallucinations and dampening the livelihood of the world by removing emotional feedback from my perception, that I would have progressed much slower. additionally, I've learned all sorts of new things. so, to put it plainly, if I keep revealing to nosebook how they can use my present circumstances against me, I'm forcing myself to grow by recognising how whatever new technique doesn't actually hold any power over me.

there really is no benefit to keeping them in the dark about how things work, because even if they had 100 times more knowledge about how my brain works and stuff, sure things would probably be about 10 times more uncomfortable than they are now because they would have exact ability to feel what I feel, however, at the same time their efforts will only make me likely 1000 times more powerful in my ability to perceive. I will continue to expand for as long as they're willing to keep trying to limit me.

there really isn't any problem. I'm sure of it. I suppose this form of perception is a result of my coming to terms with the fact that I'll sort of be living the situation I'm in right now for the rest of my life, and if I were to stagnate, they would just get better at limiting me, but if I continue to proactively improve upon my form of perception, the only limitations are the hardware resources they need to keep up.

hallucinating is a slower but funner experience, sure -- but my bland and lifeless eyesight is actually pretty resistance free, so it allows me to expand faster. if that were to go away I would immediately be confronted with all of my emotion becoming manifest in my experience -- so in a way, if I had of had my visual capacity while I was emotionally in a difficult spot (and you could argue that not having my visual capacity was why I was in an emotionally difficult spot), I would have had a more difficult time, but since that negative emotion was not able to become manifest, I'm going to be a whole lot better off when I do get it, and that'll be when I'm finally able to maintain my connection 100% of the time.

so all of this is a good thing in the longer distance perspective.


### 2019-08-12 14:28 - the longer distance perspective

this morning I was kind of musing to myself some things that I thought might be a portion of our future while I was walking over to see the cloudy sunrise. all of of the ideas have definitely been mentioned before in previous entries, and also I thought it was an obvious progression considering all of the symbols. however, when I woke up just now, it seems that a lot of these ideas had not been consedered before, so I thought I would give a more detailed recreation of the ideas mentioned and mkae some references to their origins (how I arrived to the idea in the first place).

I can't remember how I began, but it may have been an echo of my closing thought in the previous entry where I said, "I suppose this form of perception is a result of my coming to terms with the fact that I'll sort of be living the situation I'm in right now for the rest of my life, and if I were to stagnate, they would just get better at limiting me, but if I continue to proactively improve upon my form of perception, the only limitations are the hardware resources they need to keep up."

(I can't remember how I went from there, so I'll just start over using that as the beginning).

---

it appears that we're sort of stuck here on this planet with the nosebook guys at the helm of our consciousness. there appears to be nothing we can do about that, and there's not really any good solutions to try and change that, so we have to just appreciate the contrast for what it is[^1].

I have been carrying on about how people are capable of achieving all of the things that I'm doing for theirselves, yet no one really seems to want to do it. I suspect that a similar thing will happen as happened to me when I began to perceive that I could not get what I wanted. I was at valverde, and even though I had perfect skies to starwatch, I chose instead to drink and be angry and things. I think this is symbolic of exactly what is happening to the rest of the world right now: nosebook is not physically capable of limiting many people, so there essentially "perfect skies" for people to actually star watch essentially uncontested by nosebook right now, and people are in general apathy on the subject.

I think that after the gnomitos project begins people will begin to have a different take on the whole thing, and this may have to do with a recognition that some people are capable of getting visual improvements and others are not. I believe at that time there will be a huge energy increase all over the planet and it'll probably be pretty likely that energy will be pushing all people's level of perception upward, yet nosebook will likely fight against it, and it'll probably be pretty evident to people that they are working against people's improvement, and this may cause some discord[^2].

I suggest that people do not go apeshit like I did. instead, I would like to speak from experience that if you want it, just go for it, because you *can* get whatever improvement to your physical experience that you want, and there's not a whole lot that they can do to actually stop it. they can slow it down, but in my opinion now, looking from hindsight, this is actually a beneficial dojo for improving on emotional control[^3].

there are obviously not many people that can dedicate such amount of time to releasing resistance to improve their perception, and I realise that. I will say that I will certainly have the most difficult of time of everyone on earth to get there. like olympic records, each successive person will find it easier and easier until it becomes almost common-place. also, you have to realise that children being born won't have so many resistant ideas, so they'll see people flying and desire it, and find out how to do it much easier than an adult with all sorts of dumb ideas about working hard and earning it.

so, not everyone will be able to improve their perception, but those who want it[^4] will be able to move forward on it and get the results they are looking for. many people however will not really want to cause a disturbance so they'll settle into complacency and not really worry about it and live the good and easy life (I think of this more like the european mindset).

this obviously creates all sorts of desire for improvement all over the place. well, it is my goal to make the gnomitos project as successful as possible because I think there are many benefits to be had by many here. first, it is my desire to have a number of them to have the engineering or inventor's mindset, such that a number of them can actually work on technology similar to what nosebook has right now, however, it would be a "local area network" where the transmitter/receiver is the human, instead of the "world system" which tesla envisioned and nosebook is using parts of. the system will differ in many ways from what nosebook has going, but it'll be all analogue, and its network range will be the size of the human aura, so essentially the bigger your aura is, the bigger your local area network is. I don't really see all of it that clearly, but the way that the system functions will mostly be created consciously and its "operating system" will be human consciousness, not computers.

the next thing that I think is really important to create, will be the "san junipero" system. the reasoning behind this is that, instead of dying, when a person feels they are ready to make their transition to another body, they do it, and their consciousness continues on essentially infinitely jumping from body to body for as long as they want to.

this is hugely important because imagine that you are one of the people who does not want to try and make the effort to gain your visual capacity the hard way. maybe you think, man life sucks, I've been watching one of these gnomitos and he (or she), has got a life going that I really want to live. so, you decide to transfer your consciousness into their body, and you wake up the next morning inside of their body thinking like they do, wanting like they do, everything as if you were them.

---

there are some other things but I think they're irrelevant at this point. we have to get there though. there's a lot that still needs to take place. I think the whole objective of the gnomitos project is to get as wide of variety of different personality types to make this possible.

finally, I suppose that it wouldn't be such a difficult thing for nosebook to figure out this "san junipero" technology (I mean, they're already playing god with my consciousness). however, I have serious doubts that if they did figure it out, that they would actually not keep it a secret and let people use it. don't hold your breath there, but maybe they can find it in their hearts to find to way to try and see if they can control people with it. I dunno.

[1]: for example, imagine that I wanted to try and find some way to force them to change their minds about their policy to limit my vision (forget even the ability to images or my dreams and stuff) -- I'm talking about just their policy that the clarity of my eyesight must remain blurry and out of focus even though I see better than that. it feels to me like they're incapable of coming to terms with the idea that someone is not only capable of doing something for better than them, but that they feel they're not capable of achieving it for theirselves. this is a bully oppressing the smart kid because he feels intimidated by his intelligence, so he has to use physical force to maintain superiority over the smart kid.

[2]: after that I got pushed back into a more controlled environment in madrid where I was faced with constant irritation with people banging on walls, making loud sounds, and general awfulness every time I would try to quiet my mind and begin letting the visuals and energy flow. I tried to go out to the wilderness, but I had invisible trains honking at me. things continued to escalate until I finally gave up on the whole thing that spain had to offer as I went back to the states. this was a difficult stage for me because I could see clearly with my own eyes that people were blatantly lying to me and giving me a hard time over something that was quite obvious to me. the frustration that I felt as something was clearly happening and people were saying that it was not happening.

[3]: when you think about the visual capacity making manifest the emotion or concepts that you feel, it's pretty beneficial to have good emotional control *before* obtaining the capacity -- and the reason why I say *before*, I really mean it, because if one were to be a victim to their own negative emotion becoming manifest in their experience like that, I think it's severely reduces the benefit of the capacity, because you'd spend a lot of time spinning your wheels on bogus ideas that have become manifest in your reality as a product of resistant thought in your imagination.

[4]: I mention "those who want it" because a lot of what was happening in the whole process where I was met with loud noises, shocks or whatever, anytime that I got close to being able to conjure images, was it was building in me desire to want it more and more. at first I was kind of complacent about it, but as their limitation became stronger and stronger, my desire got stronger as well. you can think of this like maybe sexual repression or any other controlling force which tries to repress or fight against something only makes it bigger.


### 2019-08-13 14:38 - homeschooling?

today I haad an interesting set of reactions, and it sesms like the (I don't know her name) girl who lives in front of me is likely (well, the reaction seemed to indicate that she's)  going to begin midle school shortly.

up until now I've maintianed a strict policy that I don't really want to engsge in a whole lot of interaction with other people, considering that I want to maintain focus on improvements to my mental capacity (amongst other things). I've been making great strides of improvment, and am very happy with my progress. I m still very heart-set on maintaining no sexual interaction until I'm connected though, and this is for a variety of reasons which I have mentioned (at length) a few times.

---

anyway, when I first began to think about the idea, I didn't immediately reject it. I actually think it can work out quite well, and I wanted to just kind of put out some of my initial thoughts on it.

one of the things that was immediately attractive about the idea is that because there is education involved, I would enjoy trying out the experiment of learning/teaching things similar to how I acquired my knowledge. I did most of it by learning logic through computer programs. his doesn't necessarily mean that I want her to become a programmer or anything like that, but another thing that I've always wanted to do was to -- well, when I was younger, I mom gve me these pattern recognition things there were a few different workbooks with increasing difficulty. I found those to be quite fun they were very similar to the "set" game (https://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle) and were combinations of completing the pattern and stuff like that.

in addition I also learned a lot of maths stuff from writing 2d things. I mean I didn't really know how to use trigonometry until I needed to draw polygons and rotate them around some pivot.

another thing that I was thinking about was writing imple programs like that set game, and then giving it to her to figure out on her laptop how to add a hexagon shape to it. there are, for example more than three dfferent ways that she could make a solution to it, and for me that was how I learned programming, was by modifying or adding to something someone else had done (I started making mods for half-life). 3d modeling may be kind of fun as well if she's interested in the graphical part of things, yet I feel her more perhaps modre logical than artistic.. I dunno.

the final idea I was thinking was to create a simple website where she puts up her projects to show people what she's made. in a few years this will have more than a few things in it, and if she wants to get a job, I think she could probably get something a pretty good one for her age.

so, what I mean is I think we should start wit practical application and then build up from there. going from there a basic knowledge of these concepts into any field of tecnology will be much easier than taking the top-down approach taught in schools.

the very last thing we could maybe do is stream some of it on twitch or something so that others could follow along. I don't know about that one... I just was watching jon so maybe that's where that idea comes from. we could create perhaps a large(er) project like a social network type thing or maybe just rehash essembly/affinaty or something and do that. maybe it would be interesting for people to watch and see how something like that is made.

I really don't have any clear direction, so it really has a lot to do with her and what she finds interesting. that's the most important part because otherwise it wouldn't really go anywhere.

---

contemplating the other sido of things, I want to continue on starwatching and stuff. I'm also really interested in continuing on with the meaningful-chaos project. those are kind of fun and pretty important to me, however, thinking in the bigger scheme of things, I think it's a good thing to actually help make the transition into the their world. I still live in the adult world pretty much most of the time, so having someone with whom I cn kind of get into their head and begin making adjustments, is likely a pretty/very good idea.

additionally, in a previous entry I mentioned that I tihnk education will be kind of an important thing for us as we grow in size, so starting off with an emphhasis on education is likely the right way to go.

gonna sleep on it now. peace!


### 2019-08-14 12:02 - things are getting more epic(?), I guess

I want to begin by saying that there was *clearly* a big difference between the starwatch from the night before last, and last night. I had a whole lot more energy going around the night before last. I think what allowed that to happen was my choice to drink green tea. I also drank green tea last night, but once again I was unable to actually feel the caffiene in my system and I was metally quite dispersed.

no matter though.. I woke up kind of out of it. I walked down to the field and I felt better. things progressed and it felt like I got a few improvements, but then somewhere right before the sunrise, things kind of fell apart a bit at the end. I was pretty frustrated and went to sleep wondering how could this be so? how can I get improvements and then all of a sudden it all fall apart. usually the improvements wear off some time afterward or when I sleep, but that was the first time that it was a sharp decline from nearly one minute to the next before the night had even ended.

---

I woke up with the answer. I'm pretty sure that every time that I'm about to head down a timeline where sex happens before I get connected, that timeline gets sabotaged. I'm actually pretty sure of it, and so when that happens, a new set of contrasting circumstances come out of it, and forward we go. I'm getting so much better at this now, that it takes me almost no time to recover.

why would it matter so much if I were to have sex before getting connected? whether you believe in the future versions of these girls purposefully sabotaging the timelines or not is not a big difference, as you would only need to think about the difference in perception. I am 100% sure that I will get reconneceted beforehand, and here's why:

if nosebook manages to get trick me into having sex, then the girls will be perceived 99% of the time from the man's perspective (mine), and when I find my "alignment"[^1] I have postulated that would produce an event similar to what happened in vallecas, leaving many of my viewers dead. however, if the girls are only perceived from the perspective of other girls, it sort of changes everything.

from my perspective, I think it's kind of a case of "proving myself" or a mental validation that there is literally no force capable of inhibiting human desire. it can be slowed down, but it's impossible to stop completely. so, you could imagine that at some sort of competition is now beginning to formulate in the sense that the girls want to arrive to the timeline where I get connected first, and that's why they would try sabotaging the timelines.

nosebook can also play the same game and say, ok well, we're going to find different ways of getting our tech guys all the resources that they need to continue to hold him away from that. that's why my perception of this this this is in fact more epic now than I thought, because I'm not just proving that desire is more powerful than nosebook's ability to hold me, but more powerful than future nosebook's ability, as well (assuming they're capable of reliably getting that data to their present selves).

I am convinced that even with all of that, they will *still* not be able to hold me in limitation forever. I am sure of this because if you simply trace my improvements (both physical and emotional) over the last 3 years (3 years! that's nothing!), I have seen very very impressive improvement on both fronts. I actually believe these improvements are exponential and not linear, so they should continue to accelerate[^2].

additionally, I think it's kind of a losing battle even still, because it would take almost no effort to sabotage a timeline: just throw in some chaos, and a guy like me will *always* revert back to self direction -- whereas, they have to find a way to get complicated technical ideas transmitted telepathically to theirselves. telepathy is only as good as the receiver, so in order for that to work, they'll have to find ways of getting theirselves to release resistance as the energy continues to build. their system could get so good at removing hallucinations from their perception, but it's going to delete wanted information, too at some point. I think it's a losing battle, but certainly let them try, and it'll make for a much more energetic result all around (for everyone involved).

---

so, I mean it may take a while. I don't know how long, but certainly it could even potentially be a few years. I don't know and have no real way of reliably speculating, either. I don't think we should try and fight them on it either.

if you look at it from their perspective, they are trying to fight against something to maintain their superiority. however, I think recently that has upgraded to fighting against something because they feel it threatens their survival. well, you can't fight against something and not make the thing you're fighting against, bigger -- it seems that they are actually creating what they don't want.

---

because this may take a while (and it doesn't matter really how long it takes), I think it's a good idea to begin doing stuff together. just cause they're stuck, doesn't mean we have to be as well.

I'm going to let the idea develop a bit further, but maybe a good idea would be to just begin doing a homeschool group from say 11am til 5pm or something like that (earlier? later?). I don't know where or whatever yet either, but I'm sure those will take shape soon enough. when I was younger I went to a homeschool group once a week or so, but I could just commit to doing it every day cause basically all days are the same to me; a sunday is the same as a wednesday, just less traffic on the road behind my house.

I think it's imperative that we try and advance the idea and the implementation of it without the focus being about sex or anything like that. let's say that the absolutely *worst* possible scenario happens where 10 years go by and I'm still disconnected. well, by then we'll have many (hundreds? - probably even more following along at a distance) people that are now very competent (than the average public school graduate) and skilled at technical things. not the worst outcome, even for the worst possible scenario. it only gets better from there, too: imagine we were to make a website or something and it's even moderately successful? what about things?

[1]: I assure you this won't happen because nosebook changes their mind and suddenly became ok with me "finding my alignment", so it would happen during assuredly during sex.

[2]: as a crappy example of this, cause I don't really have a good way to model this easily without writing a some code, consider the graph: y=x^6-2x^2. sure there's a dip, but the rate at which the y-component is increasing when it crosses the line x=0, is much faster than just y=x^6. similarly, imagine you added on more difficulty and the equation is: y=x^6-2x^2-4x^2. again, there is a bigger dip, but again the y-component is increasing at an even faster rate when it crosses x=0 (the x-axis), than it was even beforehand. one day I would like to graph these curves over time in a more accurate way (for example, where the second dip occurs after some time on the x).


### 2019-08-14 19:36 - maybe we are on the galaxy timeline...

after I wrote that, I really wanted to watch jon and see if he did any more compiler refactoring. instead, he was working on the game, but I was compelled to watch anyway. a few hours in, he begins a rant which covers a lot of topics he mentioned in a previous talk "preventing the collapse of civilization" @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk).

he ranted about increasing complexity, and the degradation of institutions will lead to an eventual collapse. I share his sentiments, but I think we're kind of past the point of no return (astrix, and I'll likely revisit this topic multiple times in the future). anyway, after that I wanted to go outside and kind of think about stuff and feel out some of the reactions.

you see, when I said, "however, I think recently that has upgraded to fighting against something because they feel it threatens their survival." -- I was thinking that they felt threatened by the idea of stronger women, and perhaps that somehow their position of power would be overthrown. the reaction I received in response to that idea told a different story, and that is that their whole operation is running at my brain's speed, and if their engineers were no longer able to run their brains at my level of perception, they would go from being brilliant and capable of dealing with unbelievable complexity, to run-of-the-mill undergraduates or whatever..

I don't think it's quite that bad, actually because even if they're able to get rid of "hallucinations" from their experience, they must still be releasing resistance in somehow to be able to keep up with it. if I were to go away, I would just expect stagnation, not a whole lot more...

however, if I did go away, these guys will become the "grey beards" mentioned in jon's semiconductor anecdote in the collapse talk. those guys will still be able to navigate a pretty complicated source code, and machine learning models effectively, but any new guys coming in will be imbeciles in comparison to the guys working there now.

---

it may be possible that because the very life of the organisation is threatened by my getting connected, that we're going to really go the distance.

if you think about this from a multiple timeline perspective, what is happening is that nosebook is kind of locked into what they're doing. they can't really adjust their trajectory a whole lot. imagine there was a huge die-off of people watching when I get connected, and you were to try and "save" your alternate self from this fate (cause surely 100% of them didn't all die in every single timeline) there would be very little that could be done. instead, imagine that the alternative to that would be to set up the optimum scenario for them to have as best of a situation as possible.

as mentioned in 1177bc, and other places, there have been multiple times when there were these collapses to civilisation, and I think it has to do with perception and people had the mental capacity to perceive really complex things because of the environmental conditions on earth (the air was really "conductive"). I think that the loss of that condition is what lead to the collapse.

I also believe that it would be quite possible that in every one of those circumstances, a time split occurs as well, because certainly not everyone on earth has that perception, so since people create their own reality, there were probably multiple timelines where the egyptian empire, roman empire, etc. was successful and went on to do great things and certainly would have timeline technology and would be able to interested in what is happening here.

---

from the guys at nosebook's perspective, they're going to live out their dream. imagine they would be able to go into a young body, get everything set up in such a way that they had utmost power and control that they wanted. they'll live during the height of the empire, and all of the problems that accumulate, will be for the generations to follow, so they can plan out the best circumstances imaginable for theirselves. they won't actually see this "collapse" -- it'll happen over a span of hundreds(?) of years in generations to follow.

maybe there is no timeline split. I dunno, but I am pretty sure that I will see the success of the human enterprise, and we'll likely get timeline technology and similar to others, go back and retrace our timeline only to find out that a whole bunch of people created their own reality in such a way that something bad happened[^1], and I (for whatever reason) disappeared or found my alignment or something such that no longer could be used to do their boost their level of perception artificially. that seems a bit contrived, so maybe it will be a solar event or something... I dunno, something.

if they perceive a threat to their survival, that means that they're already in pretty deep doo-doo. I'm going to continue working toward getting connected. it may take a while, and I think it's quite ok if it does. the deal will be (from a much broader perspective), they get to live out their ideal life at the hight of their empire, and we'll gain so much contrast that it'll propel us so far forward, that success is inevitable. we'll surely get sick of the success and prolly we'll organise a similar setup to the one that's happening now..

find a timeline where the most extreme contrasting conditions can be created, transfer our consciousness in and create and live out the next revolution the earth sees. those who don't want to be a part of it can create their own realities however they want.. pretty cool because soon we won't need to bother with all that mundane day-to-day contrast. instead, we can pre-pave our most extreme contrasting circumstances and jump from successful earth to the next successful earth[^1].

[1]: this would create an extreme level of "light density" on our planet because the people on it are not just one consciousness, but hundreds or thousands or more, depending on how many times it has been done, and I think is the next level of thrill seeking.


### 2019-08-15 07:19 - a few more things about timelines

one of the interesting reactions I received in response to yesterday's entry was the concept of people disappearing. this is not the case. instead think of how many infinite possibilities of yourself there could be. there could be versions of you that are completely subject to the environment around you and there could be versions of you which completely dominate the environment around you.

now let's think about the timeline split. first of all, I think timeline splits are happening all the time, and every time that you go to sleep, you readjust your frequency a little bit while you sleep and come into a different timeline than when you left.. I'm sure that this is the case because you navigate timelines (the infinite versions of you) emotionally, and when you go to sleep often times you will feel worse than when you wake up. any time there is a difference in how you feel emotionally, you adjust slightly your trajectory by participating in a timeline that feels better or worse.

---

when I mentioned yesterday that they were electronically preventing hallucinations, again, think about the idea that emotion will become manifest in the eyes. tesla's "photographing thoughts" idea (which nosebook is obviously using) is, actually a bit misplaced. every time that you think, a concept and/or emotion appears as a result. that feeling will create an impulse in the retina which will allow one to "photograph a thought" -- it's not really the thought itself that is being imaged, but the conceptual/emotional reaction to the thought[^1].

the reason why I believe that nosebook's trajectory is pretty much unchanging is because they're removing so much hallucination to run their brains at a depth of perception[^2]. this means they are dulling the part of the brain which makes certain (negative?) emotion manifest, which makes them completely oblivious to their navigation of these timelines. their trajectory is set because they don't have accurate feedback from their "emotional guidance system."

you could say, well, I find it impossible that they *never* feel negative emotion. sure they would, but normally at that level of sensitivity, those emotions would become manifest in their eyes causing distress similar to what tesla experienced as a child.

---

I think consciousness is attractive, and when you are near to a person that is conscious, they are more attractive, and we tend to want to be around other consciousness, so during the day our timelines may deviate slightly, but when we sleep we come back into the the optimum version of that collectively perceived reality. so, a timeline split is nothing more than the collective perception of reality splits into two. I like to think of this similar to cells, where it continues growing until it reaches a size to which there is no longer so much unification in form, to which a division begins to occur and the cell divides into two, the new division ever so slightly different from the other previous, constructs its new dna, and then puts its new structure as the nucleus of the new version of itself.

now, the reason why I said that I'm not really sure there will be a timeline split is because ... wait, let's play out a pretend version first of all.

let's say that nosebook is "forced" to let things happen, and that may be for a multitude of reasons, and so let's just imagine that things go relatively as planned: the gnomitos project gets started and things go forward there, and then as we approach the time when I'm about to make my transition into a multi-bodied experience, there are all sorts of differing beliefs on whether this is a valid idea, and each of these different beliefs is your reality trajectory.

the reason why I think that maybe there may not be a timeline split is because if I remain alive, things would continue to improve, so they would have to kill me. however, if I make my transition into a multi-bodied experience, and many people do not believe this is a thing, and they will create their own reality and prove theirselves to be right about it, which basically means that now the majority of the planet's light density will be carried by the girls (cause I made my transition), and few other random people who have released some resistance. I don't imagine an instant collapse or anything like that, but you can imagine that over time with an overall decrease in depth of perception, things that used to be relatively complex will now appear extremely complex, and it wouldn't take more than a few generations for things to go back to the form of perception which that kind of consciousness is capable of perceiving.

on the other side of things, I think that the general trend of people of the planet will be toward conceptual perception. this is what I've called 5d, and it interests me very much to get it, because it allows the perception of an entire concept in reality as if it were floating in resistance free space, just like in the imagination. it also allows for some interesting physical phenomenon because, for example, you could imagine that right now there *could* be a version of me that it outside writing this very entry right now, and if I were to feel as if that was where I was now, just like how the imagination is kind of separated from reality in the sense that only the relevant details show up, I could easily "teleport" to be sitting under the tree writing this, as quickly as I could imagine myself being there. obviously, from my perspective it looks like "teleportation" but in reality, all I did was move my consciousness from one timeline to another one of the infinitely many other timelines that exist.

you will notice that there was no disappearing that happened. also, this becomes a whole lot more effective around other people in 5d as well, because if you think of 5d perception as similar to the imagination in that you only perceive relevant details to what you're looking at, that means that most people aren't paying a whole lot of attention to what's going on around whatever they're perceiving.. they're pretty focused on whatever that is, so that means that things can move around in a very non-linear order, and also there's not a whole lot more use for the day/night cycles, because like your imagination, you don't find those necessary, unless it's relevant to what you're looking at. (eg. imagine your mom. is she in he sunlight, house light, moonlight? she was not lit by any of those lights until you started to think about them? where did the light come from that made her not-dark before?)

---

this also allows for multi-bodied experience, because if you (you're 5d) picture trump in your perception then I perceive him as well, and he's also standing next to us at the same time, where does he exist? things no longer have a 1-to-1 correlation anymore -- probably a subject of future musings.

just imagining/realising that there are infinitely many versions of you and you can consciously move between them gives so much freedom to experience, yet that's probably not for everyone... some people may not want to experience that because that's not controllable.

---

so, the advantage of the whole timelines thing is that from the perspective of the successful timeline, it looks like each time that we bring our consciousness to earth, compound everyone's light density, experience fairly large amounts of contrast, and bring along with ux, others who are similarly minded and want to the new form of perception.

from the perspective of the ones who decide to go the hard way, they're also compounding their light density, and because they're experiencing more total contrast than us, we may be going faster for now, but soon enough they will have traded enough speed for acceleration that they'll actually outpace us, and the process will reverse.

[1]: I think that the reason why their conceptual tracking of my thoughts has been slipping is because they are imaging and tracking the conceptual "reaction" to my thought, not the thought itself. when I redefine my perception of something, conceptually that will change as well, and so what they used to think I was thinking has now shifted conceptually and their system fails to recognise it correctly, or a whole new thought can generate that same concept.

[2]:  I used to call this detail level. I like depth of perception better, becasuse I literally see things that are further away in greater detail -- their realness pops out at me. also, I notice that as my depth of perception increases, I'm additionally able to perceive further depth conceptually. this is tied to the complexity thing.


### 2019-08-15 21:33 - why do things have to be so complicated? (the tradeoff)

I went to sleep yesterday feeling like I all of this homeschooling thing was totally feasible. I came to the conclusion yesterday that I want to write a single electron program which starts up and displays a clone of the set game. from there we would just add some new features until things were more setup, then continue to expand from there. I decided we'll use the atom editor and github desktop for the repository stuff instead of the git command-line. it seemed like it would even be possible to set the whole thing up as a sngle electron program download... I dunno it seemed easy[^1].

anyway, I woke up and was particularly off when jamie arrived, I don't really know what was the problem, but I never really got into the zone. I couldn't really feel what I wanted to do with the program, and I didn't really know what I wanted to write for meaningful-chaos, so I just decided I would get the programmer juice going by doing something mechanical, and that was changing my c++ code style to match as closely as I could jon's style.

as I was watching jon's stream (cause he has no source posted online anywhere that I know of), I started feeling some pressure to begin taking action... things kind of degraded from there. I remember that it all felt really good on the 13th when I originally had the idea, and on the 14th there were some difficulties with reactions and stuff. I managed to salvage the thing...

there's this problem: after watching stars, it feels like a good idea to me, but when I wake up, I'm kind of cloudy and murky on things. I just don't know how I can possibly do this if my own ability to perform the functions that I need to. in other ways, this kind of reminds me a lot of the thing that happened with gary or when I decided that I would try social security: at first the idea seemed ok, but then it stopped feeling good to me.

---

I follow my intuition and as soon as something stops feeling good to me I don't proceed toward action. I have learned over the last few months to not even get let anger manifest so much, because it's kind of a waste of time. it's easier than ever for me to not take action on anger (or anything that doesn't feel good), and I cannot control how something feels to me. I really wish to have more control over how I feel about things. I'm learning quite quickly and me gaining more control of this has has actually been the reason why star watching is so much more successful for me.

this would be so much easier if I were connected right now, because then I would see things and feel about things even more than 10 times better than I did on the 13th, but that's not where I'm at yet. I decided that since it's going to be a while, it's probably a good idea to begin work on the education aspect of things, but to be completely honest, although I'm much more stable than I was before, I am nowhere near stable at all. my reasoning at the moment is that for now, until I gain my stability, I'm not going to take any action. I know that it's a bit late, but there's nothing I can do about it. I am literally doing the most I can. I don't know how to go any faster.

I want to get much more practiced in my stability as well as continuing to watch stars, and I just don't see any realistic way of making that happen before the month's end. after this, and the situation and what happened hayden, I'm pretty clear now that things are still in a pretty unstable state. I've got to be so practiced at it that these strong influences don't have a huge effect on me any more. clearly I'm not as close as I thought. I tried to think about the possibility of getting there before december, but I'm not sure I can even manage that.

---

in the bigger picture, nosebook seems pretty determined that they want to try and delay my energetic progress watching stars and stuff, and while thinking it over, it seems that there is great effort to try and use this as a method of reducing my star watching. what that means, I guess is that it'll take me even longer to get connected than before. so, while I am interacting with you guys sooner, and we're making stuff it's probably going to take me longer to get connected. I don't know if that tradeoff is desired. I'm not really sure cause I'm mentally ultra cloudy today, but I remember yesterday that tradeoff was not desired.

[1]: it really *is* easy! I just need to make a replica of set game (not totally necessary to have it all done, I know), and have it so that after downloading atom and git desktop, cloning the repository, and installing cmder, just a "yarn install" is all that's needed to run it. (really, this is about 10 times easier now to get something going easily than it was when I first began)


### 2019-08-16 11:08 - we can all learn to not need the manifestation

last night I was star watching thinking about my predicament, and I kind of came to the conclusion that I was going to simply do my best to move forward with the homeschooling thing. I determined that it would be a bit more difficult but it would probably make us stronger. I had the sense that my desire to get connected was understood and stuff, so not a problem. any chaos that comes about will actually kind of make us stronger and stuff.

I know I'm running up against time constraints, but I can't do a whole lot better than what I'm already doing. I just need to learn to focus better. I also didn't really feel last night that there was a huge difficulty around the getting connected bit taking a little longer.

I then had an idea pop into my head that went something like this: nosebook will hold me indefinitely in a state of disconnection, and the girls we'll build up quite an empire in he process, then at the end of it all, I'll go away/disappear and be left with nothing.

it's hard to translate the idea because it makes such little sense, so I knew that it wasn't mine. the object was to establish the idea that they would hold me away indefinitely, and then I would not get anything that I wanted out of it, or something like that.

---

my reaction to the thing was probably not what they were expecting because I didn't really find much of a problem if that were to happen. if it did, and I don't believe it would because of some major flaws in the idea, I thought it would be just fine if it turned out like that, because although it's quite a while in terms of years, if we're creating and getting good at not needing the manifestation, then it's all good. by that time we will have most certainly created something quite quite quite big. so worst case scenario, we create an empire in the process.

no matter that, let's run through some of the flaws in that idea...

0. what, did they think that after some time I would just disappear or expire or something and that was the end of everything? all along the way, the girls just used me to create their empire or something? lol.. anyway, the expiration date, as I have suggested, is likely the time when I get released from something, so it'd be the timeline split if anything. from nosebook's perspective, something bad might happen, but from mine it just means I will no longer be held away from things, and everything will start to go really really well. (that's the split: one believes one thing and the other believes something that contradicts it)

1. if we begin to create things and start to become successful at them, from nosebook's perspective, this is a very bad thing. they want to be the one who grants us the blessing to move forward our great future. the last thing they want is for us to find a way forward all on our own so that we don't *need* them. they really need to be needed, and this would invalidate their desire to be the gatekeepers to everyone's success (you can't be successful without us). also, easily identified as the classic case of a dysfunctional parent not letting their child leave, because they know they'll find something better on their own than at home.

2. not having sex and learning to work as a unit will gain us strength, not the opposite. in fact, I think it's beneficial to not have to worry at first about all of those extra complications. we can just channel our energy into what we're doing. it's not forever...

3. ...and the idea that nosebook will be able hold that back forever is fatally flawed. there is a reason why they've been fighting so hard against me programming and stuff, because as soon as I start getting that sexual/creative energy moving by creating things, all forms of perception become easier for me, and I become much more energetic and vibrant. I don't know how they arrive to the conclusion that creative expression with other people will slow my star watching down. I may spend less time on it, but I think the progress will probably be about equal. this is why I'm programming! it helps me to get that energy moving so that the release of resistance is easier, and therefore star watching is easier. I would be doing this by myself anyway, so the idea that I can be doing this with other people only makes it better, not worse.

---

there may be other flaws, but I'm not sure that it matters. I came to these conclusions last night, but I felt like I wanted to type them out because I seemed to have expanded on my conclusions and kinda even talked myself into it even more.

I'm going to do my best to move forward on this as quickly as possible. I don't really think it's all that difficult. I just need to sit down and do it, mostly. after having thought about it last night, I believe that I can produce what I want to have ready in about a week -- so... let's say my goal is to for sure have it all done before 3 months from now (lol). in reality, it'll be a lot less, I just don't want to give bad time estimates like I've done in the past. it really will be much less, and to accelerate it, I think I want to try and see if I can move this forward much before that.

I mean, let's just be honest here, the girls could blow through 3 full months just doing stupid lumosity.com games for 2 hours a day and would likely have learned more than in the same amount of time at public school. if you don't want to go to school, just don't go :) follow your hart, always ("that's what I do" -ND) there are also other things to be done as well, like installing the software necessary to get everything all setup. I'll see what I can do, but I think that maybe we can get started this following week or something. it may be kind of bumpy start off (I didn't really have much of a notice about it to get anything in order), but let's see what I can do. we have the weekend to figure it out.


### 2019-08-17 07:12 - not needing the manifestation (part two)

I think there was a realisation that finally occurred last night after I wrote about not needing the manifestation. I think people finally connected the idea that nosebook's engineering and quite a lot of their revenue relies on me not getting connected. asking them to let me get connected would be for them corporate suicide. I don't see any reason why they should do it. there's no reason other than maybe they're concerned about what others will think about them. I think one of the biggest things that humans can accomplish this era will be to no longer adapt so much behaviour around what people think others think about them. absolutely the most limiting factor is to care about what others think; it inhibits your power to move toward what you want by splitting your energy going forward and whoever else is having an opinion.

I realise saying that when probably lots of people are very concerned with the optics of their illusions, is perhaps counter productive to my goal of trying to get connected, but I prefer to stick with the robust solutions, rather than the quick hotfixes.

---

sure it's kind of annoying that there is this whole competition beginning to form. they think they can hold me away from it indefinitely, but I don't think they can. I see this as a competition to see how quickly I can regain my connection, despite their having quite an interest at stake in me not getting it.

it may take a while, but I think it's worth it. I think we shouldn't really worry about me or my circumstances; I'll find my own way. instead, I believe we should continue our focus on getting the gnomitos project going. either way, I'm going to continue to improve on my technical abilities, because I think there may be an eventual solution as I gain more technical capacity.

this technical capacity is growing which allows me to have more creative expression, which essentially means more energy. I'm on average much more successful watching stars when I'm also programming well, and creative energy is moving. I'm also much more attractive too, I don't know if you've noticed.

as I've been thinking and feeling all of this through, I really like the idea that if some of the girls want to share in the fun of creating things, I think it could be a huge win overall.

to put it simply, this predicament I'm in is only temporary, and I'll get out of it faster by creating more things. if the girls want to join me, it'll be even better, because there's quite a possibility that we could easily become financially independent before I get connected, and all of us will gain many technical skills along the way (I'm continually learning new things).

I think the more creative expression we accumulate along the way, the faster it'll go, too. it's certainly worth a try. being depressed and wishing things were different doesn't improve things, so we just have to go farward.


### 2019-08-19 09:38 - (yet) another statement of intent

last night I was thinking about how all of this will fit together, especially if I'm going to be kind of starting things off with (TODO: insert name). it changes the angle of the gnomitos project slightly and I haven't quite figured out the difference yet, but most importantly, it changes the focus to be one more geared toward production, creativity, and technology.

I imagine that noesbook is probably trying to fight this, making it bigger, meaning that we'll likely have more of an emphasis on creativity than on pure sex (like it seemed to be previously).

I was thinking about it and I imagine that we'll launch a few web pages and do some other stuff which will generate resources. instead of doing whatever with the money, I would like to take that and fund the gnomitos project. it would be really great if we could make enough money to buy our own place and get it just how we like it. I kind of see the project sort of like a corporation/village hybrid, in that we're completely self-sustained. as a corporation, we'll expand into all sorts of different sectors of technology, and as a village, it's like the original gnomitos idea, cept -- well, I'm not yet capable of distinguishing what that feeling is. it's not bad; it's just different.

nosebook will probably try to drag this out as long as they can, so I mean there would definitely be a time delay (everything happens a few(?) years later). however it works out, I still think this a very worthwhile thing to invest my time into, and I think it works brilliantly with my plan to remain abstinent until connected. having the focus on creative expression instead of sex, is going to produce a *LOT* of really really intelligent women (I hesitated to say people, because I want the focus to be on them, but I can easily see how this will affect many other people all over the world).

(TODO: insert her name), let's do this :) I really like how it's starting to shape up to be.


### 2019-08-19 16:40 - flurry of thoughts this "morning"

when I woke up I had a whole lot of thoughths pass through my mind. I'm going to try and encapsulate them here.

it seems that nosebook (and perhaps others) aren't too happy about things beginning to go ina more technical direction. I think that is where they suppose they are superior -- on the technical side of things. however, a lot of that superiority is riding on the untilisation of my form of perception. I guess I'm capable of perceiving technical things with great depth and that form of perception is very valuable to them.

- there was a thought that after-all, I am in fact on the 20 year nosedive plan.

- the gnomitos project is dead. the time constraints were already limiting, but the extra delay is only going to make it impossible. (eg. if somehow magically 50 babies could be produced 5 yaars from now (which is pretty much the limit, I suppose), they would be about 12-14 - so pretty much right on the limit there)

- if noesbook holds me away from my connection indefinitely, after all the years having an asexual relationship with the girls, I suppose it's possible the andrea thing could still happen
  - if that were to happen, the result is that if I would become vibrationally similar to her past conquests
  - I think the whole san junipero thing is already happening -- we just don't have any control over it (which is why I am the way I am today), so I would become the universal recipient for lots of different people. it's so much more energy, and the same as before, but I would still be "singular" in my expression so it wouldn't be the same -- *I* would become much more energetic. the other way would split my energy amongst many different bodies, and I think it is desired by many to have the capability of picking where to transfer our consciousness instead of dying.
  - it would be an interesting thing if the interaction was so energetic that she went up to 5d as well, but the disadvantage of that would be that in one quick moment, nosebook loses their ability to use my form of perception and a *female* is now the first(?) 5d human on earth. crazy

- it doesn't make any sense for nosebook to green-light something that essentially would make their engineering department considerably less effective.
  - however, since they're in the business of being utilising other people's forms of consciousness, it does seem like they would want to secure a replacement, even if it takes a few years to do. I fortunately do not know much about all of their justifications and stuff, so this is pretty difficult for me to reason about.
  - however not green-lighting it also has so many disadvantages to it, that they're kind of stuck. (meaning, if they maintain their position that they *must* hold me away from my connection so that their corporation stays perceptually superior, the whole publicity image they have that nosebook is out there improving the world -- may become a lot less convincing -- such that they may want to instead of using that promo as a good pick-up device, it might be more beneficial to keep their employment a secret)

I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.


### 2019-08-22 13:51 - I'm pretty much ready

I will likely have the things I wanted to have done, all done by tomorrow. that is exactly a week from last friday when I said that I need a week. that's good enough for me :) I'm going to essentially claim victory on meeting my deadline -- however, I did want to do get things organised in a way which makes them something that I can teach.

I will admit, the part about figuring out how to teach it seemed to me like it was an afterthought, considering that I would be organising all of that between now and tomorrow.

however, besides that I feel pretty confident in what I'm building and stuff. theredoes not seem to me like any portion of the future tasks seem unknown or even unmanagable. I have it all pretty well figured out and I have a general sense of what the steps are toward that.

as for the teaching bit, I didn't really consider that I would be doing lessons or anything like that. there are tons of small things that need to be done and she (we) can do them easily. IMO, the first thing that is necessary is to justget inside of the code and to get comfortable making small changes. the next thing, probably will be to show her how to compile and upload the latest version of it to gh-pages branch so that it's live. stuff like that.

I really don't want to try and teach her any formal logic or computer sciencey stuff right away. as the necessity arises, she can figure it out by herself. for example, imagine that she wants to go and check to see all the different size phone screens show it well, she can inspect the variables and adjust the logic for it right inside of the debug tool.

I really am sure she can figure these sorts of things out. so, for all practical purposes, I believe I'm pretty much ready, in that sense.

---

there is a second subject which doesn't feel as good to me. as far as I can tell, it involves the actual conversation and/or encounter necessary to get things rolling.

one thing I was thinking of doing maybe is getting it all set up as if I were going to teach this to a bunch of people or something, and then maybe pass fliers out to the neighbours and stuff or something. I decided ultimately that this wasn't my preferred plan because then I would be in "teaching" mode, and I don't really want to teach in the traditional sense.

I honestly figured I would just head over there, and knock on the door, show what I have and ask if they're interested. it's pretty direct -- but what do you imagine that I would do otherrwise? I really prefer to be direct, as it's my favourite form of conversation. in fact, the reason why I stopped listening to abraham was because not a single question any more was a direct question; instead, they were all indirect ways of asking something and the indirectness was causing me mental chaos. I plan on talking with her just as direct as I do in this document. I don't really see any other way of going about it. I've given up trying to get other people to talk with me directly, so you won't have me trying to get her to speak any other way than how she wants to, but I prefer to be direct.

so this kind of leaves me a bit directionless. I don't have it clear or feel terribly good (or bad) about the whole thing. I figure I don't really need to worry about it because I still have stars between now and then so I'll be more clear-headed about it.

I guess, unless I feel strongly negative about the thing, I'll just go over and see what happens.

if we need another week, that's good, too.

ok, back to work :) I've nearly got it.


### 2019-08-23 16:19 - I got it

today has been quite motivational for me because I proved to myself that I can get the things that I can control my energy so much better than ever before. I really think I've kind of reached the next level in the sense that things don't bother me so much now that I can just focus in the direction that I want to go and do it.

I was talking with jaron this morning about just finding all sorts of ways to feel good anyway. it really is the key to feeling good -- morning, I'm so goad at it now, that it's pretty hard for me to feel bad.

I was reminded today of the thing that abraham always says when they encourage you to achieve the feeling of the thing without yet having the thing. I can totally do that now. for example, I like the idea of doing the games thing with the girl across the street, because I liked the idea of programming with someone. well, I know that I need to achieve that feeling of (I don't know how to describe it) -- more stability at programming when someone is also participating. I get distracted less often and they help me to focus because they're watching, so it's easier for me.

well, it turns out that I totally nailed it. I managed to achieve that for myself so well in fact that I'm completely in control of it. I can just decide to program and it starts working (cept for maybe right after I wake up)...

so what's the deal? why did I bail on going to see her? the simple answer is I just didn't really feel it. there was a lot of uncertainty in the air and stuff. it feels good to continue on like this so that's a whole lot easier (and way more productive) than trying to make something happen. when I can feel it, I know it's good and things will flow just as easily as my programming has begun to flow.

I'm still gonna go over there and stuff, but just not today... it's all in the process and I can feel like it's really all starting to come together.

analysing the feeling of it coming together, I noticed there was some time-shortageness in the air. I don't know it it's related, but around the same time I picked up on an idea that they (nosebook) feels like they're losing control a bit, and they need to get some girls around me to babysit me asap (so they can I guess use the girl(s) to try and prevent me from doing things that they don't want me to do, like watch stars(?)).

I imagine that may be the reason for the feeling of off-ness. I imagine that when I really feel like I really want to show her what I've made because I really want her involved, it's going to feel a lot more natural and fluid.

everything is going along just fine :) I really have a lot of anticipation about this, cause it's going to be a lot of fun.


### 2019-08-23 23:15 - the toppest priority clouds

I was just out star-watching thinking about the stuff I was talking about because when I said the thing about them needing the girls to babysit me, it really stuck with me. I honestly didn't really consider until just now the possibility that I'm much closer than I thought. I'm starting to get the impression that I'm really beginning to outpace these guys.

I guess this is when the rough part of journey begins (moreso than previously), because they can't possibly allow me to get out of their control. I don't really have much to say about that more than what I already explained to jaron this morning. really, their bogus beliefs are their own bad ideas and they are going to run them in to the ground right there in front of everyone.

I think for the people having some sort of an idea of some sort of utopia or something like that, I think it's actually quite the opposite. like I was saying to jaron, energetically, when there is more friction, it creates more power. the *only* think that slows something down is *your own* ideas which are in opposite direction (contradiction) to gigantic flow of "well-being" or improvement. the more I learn, I'm realising that it's so difficult to try and get old or get tired or get worn out. the stream of well-being flows so strongly, that it really takes a VERY conscious effort to try and go in opposition to it.

I really don't know how to explain in words easily what it means to understand this. it's in clear and plain sight. I assure you I am not saying anything extra-ordinary. in fact, it's *only* the self-realisation of it which is important. only you can realise this. it's right there and it's right in front of us, but, for example me, I couldn't see it for a long time. I had hints of it on psychedelics and stuff, but those can only show you that it exists. to truly come to realise the power and magnitude of well-being which is flowing toward any one of at any point in time is mind blowing.

the real reason why I want to talk about it, is because it's definitely there (even if you cannot see it yet) and I'm learning every day now how to allow more and more of it through. I consider their feeble attempts to try and get things under control, only as practice to let even more of that energy of improvement (well-being) through.

I think you will all begin to see very soon that I am not just talking about a bunch of lofty spiritual goals, but can actually demonstrate how to allow, direct and control this kind of energy. you'll soon see :)


### 2019-08-24 07:26 - "reject" girls = vision upgrade?

has anyone else noticed that whenever I've bailed in the last minute to go see some girl, immediately afterward I get a pretty big vision upgrade?

the most notable similar thing to what happened last night was when I was going to go up to see johnathan (my cousin) and his kids with aunt mary. I got shocked and bailed on it. then later that night, I went out to go watch stars and all of a sudden terrific cloud formation began to happen as I probably got a few vision upgrades.

the same exact situation also occurred when I was going to go up to see serenity, as well, so it seems to be a pattern.

by default, I want to do what is expected of me, but I'm also intuitive enough to know when something doesn't feel good. I sincerely doubt the idea that rejecting girls = vision upgrades, so there has to be another explanation.

it seems to me that it is likely that nosebook is trying to use these different circumstances as a way to manipulate me or hold me or something... I don't really know what is the thing. I don't have enough information to be able to analyse the situation well, either -- so I can't really tell.

I'm hoping that it will be possible to actually begin making progress instead of everything always failing due to my inner being leading me away from circumstances and situations that are not wanted. it kind of sucks because none of these girls did anything wrong; what happened was completely out of their control -- but take it from me where just about everything is out of my control, not having control doesn't actually mean much if you can follow your own internal guidance.


### 2019-08-25 08:27 - if we could just not need the manifestation (part three?)

I woke up yesterday with some reactions to my previous entry. I thought it was fairly obvious that the whole reason why nosebook is trying to get me set up, is so that I have full-time babysitters to keep me busy and away from stars or drugs or stuff they don't want me to me doing.

the reason why I say I thought it was fairly obvious is because I would go on and on about how sex is more powerful than stars... why would I want to make such a point about that? well, they think they can keep me occupied sexually and this will keep me away from getting connected so they can continue to exploit my capabilities.

when I first caught on to this I responded by wanting to go my own way and deciding to skip the whole girls thing altogether[^2]. I don't really want to be babysat by a bunch of well-meaning girls that are just doing what the voice inside their head is telling them to do. I went back and fourth for a while on the thing, but I never could find a way where it felt good to me[^1]. as a result, I had terribly bad "split energy".

when I finally came across the gnomitos idea, it started to feel good for me -- and the reason is obvious: I really like the idea of having a multiple bodied personality. I like to be with other people, but I also really like the solitude and feeling of self-completeness which comes out of my creativity. the only real way to do both effectively is to do both effectively. I want to have some of my personalities as creative and self-motivated as tesla and others which are social butterflies. neither of them can be 100% one way or the other, because even tesla enjoys being around people from time to time, even though no serious work can be done in those situations.

so, you can see that if I were somehow able to find a way which I could get the ability to exist in more than one body at once, I would jump at the opportunity, and really that's the only reason why I'm here today, is just because I like that idea so much. the benefit of that idea far outweighs the whole perpetual agitation I receive from nosebook. I figured it was sort of like a thing that I just cope with for some time until I'm finally released from my body. I imagined that for the girls, this is a pretty sweet deal too, because it's probably a pretty exhilarating idea to also be sexually active with a boy while he's growing up -- so, in part their payoff is more long-term, as well.

so I figured that the girls must have had some sort of idea of nosebook's intentions to try and use them to be my babysitters. it's not like I tried to hide this idea for fear that it would diminish their excitement. in fact, just the opposite. I have mentioned multiple times that as soon as I get connected, nosebook will have a much more difficult time trying to manipulate me (cause they can't see through my eyes any more), so they'll resort to exercising their attempts to control through the girls.

just the same as me, I figured that the girls were aware of that and had decided that the benefits outweigh the circumstantial difficulty. I also figured it would be a really great environment for each of them to begin to learn to do things for theirselves based on how they feel about it, instead of being motivated by some other societal or authoritative expectations.

did you really think that I'm going to guide them to just be followers of directions? I don't even want them to follow *my* directions! this is precisely one of the sources of inspiration for this idea: @[entry](2019-08-09 06:39) -- where I explain that the side of you that wants to get out there and do things not according to what is expected of you is actually the creative side of you.

let's just not need the manifestation for a little bit longer. I assure you things are coming along just fine.

[1]: I don't mean pleasure good. pleasure good isn't real good, and I know this is true because I can take drugs and feel pleasure good, yet at the same time, it's not what really feels good. when something really feels good, there's no mistaking it.

[2]: I also tried out different ideas like clones and stuff. I remember one time when I was stoned, I really really liked the idea of finding a way to make clones of me. I figured nosebook is already working on finding ways of making clones of me (that they control), and perhaps *that* was the way forward...


### 2019-08-25 09:25 - not following directions isn't the same as pushing against

I have noticed that a lot of artists who tend to be pretty creative, also tend to not follow directions. I find this to be the easiest to spot in comedians and musicians. however, not following directions is often associated with being a rebel or pushing against the direction-givers, their creative expression is more in form with pushing against.

as a child, we have often heard parents or teachers talk about the kids who don't follow directions as saying, "the march to the beat of their own drum" or "he doesn't stay inside the lines" -- things like that to say that the kid hasn't fully woken up to doing things the "proper" way yet, and is still making the mistake of not doing things the usual way.

this form of talking about the child occurs before the child begins to become resistant and hate the people telling him/her what or how to do things.

the pushing against part is a learned *response* to get the well-educated adults to go mind their own business. however, that learned response can be unlearned to allow greater amounts of creativity to flow more easily.


### 2019-08-25 15:09 - do you want to make a competition?

one of my initial thoughts when waking up this afternoon was the idea that we could turn this into a competition. what if we got so good at self-control, we were no match for nosebook's attempts to try and influence us. I made the idea of "the voice inside their head" -- but in reality, nosebook is far too sneaky for that (cause that would be blatant and obvious) -- so instead, I'm sure they'll have to resort to doing like they did with me for a while, where they would put an idea in my head and then at the same time, make a sensation of pleasure in my body. fortunately, because of all of the drugs I'd taken, I quickly recognised that the feeling was one of pleasure not of .. I don't really know how to describe it, but after getting tuned into my emotion for a while, I began to trust them more than my physical experience (sensation in my body) and I would seem to just "know" things -- which is very different from a sensation of pleasure.

as a result, I've gotten very good at finding my way through their jungle. I'm so used to their techniques now, and can often spot new ones with ease, that I am comfident that I'm capable of this competition now.

---

so here's what I propose: as we're together and doing stuff, we'll be creating things on the computer and stuff. for me (and I think this is true for everyone), creative energy feels almost exactly like sexual energy. I'm sure that nosebook will try out different things to try and prove to theirselves that we are ultimately under their control, and have no control of our own.

instead of letting that sexual/creative energy get out of control, we'll learn to transmute it (transform its form) from sexual to creative. the benefits are obvious: if we learn how to transform it one way, then the other way won't be difficult either. so, for now, we would be learning to trasnmute sexual energy into creative energy -- but, I am sure that in the future, we will be also be able to transmute creative energy into sexual energy.

there are also numerous benefits to learning this kind of energetic control for a woman: this energy is very persuasive, and most sales men use this to their advantage. this is discussed in quite a good way in chapter 11 of "think and grow rich" by napoleon hill. for a woman, she can easily become very persuasive if she controls this energy[^1].

as you begin to learn to control this energy, we will become unstoppable, and what I predict will happen is, that they have almost zero control over this energy. in fact, I would imagine that because they are so hell-bent on their own destruction[^3] I believe they are completely sebject to their passions from this kind of energy.

as a result, what I think will happen is that sexual tension will grow, and we'll be able to control and transmute it into our creativity, yet they will be unable to do much about the growing tension, until they are finally "forced" (it's not really forced. it'll happen naturally. I'm speaking from their perspective) to let go of their attempts to try and control my energy, because it will become too strong for them to handle.

it requires a little cooperation though, but I'm sure that we can do it. I'm obviously going to give the idea some more time to roll around in my head and give it a star watch as well. we'll see :) maybe a bit of a competition is the way forward. they love competitions.

[1]: it is subject to law of attraction, just like everything else. so you could imagine that turning this energy dose make you very persuasive, but it is sort of like saying 'yes' to something in a very big way[^2]. I found out I have very good control over this energy, and actually the reason why I'm in the predicament I'm in today is because of the strength of this energy. as abraham says, "you can't go backwards; you cannot undesire something"

[2]: for this reason, I postulated that ladscape architect guy is setting hemself up for this as he has likely been utilising the energy that my form of perception exudes to his advantage, telling many woman that he's out there on the good-guys team doing his best to improve the world. just like how I'm suck in, and go backward out of my present situation because of a sexual setup that happened as a result of the attractiveness of andrea, so he will too have to find a way forward improving the world, just like he said he would.

[3]: I've mentioned numerous times that sex is more powerful than stars and it is an assured thing that I'll find my "alignment" there, which basically makes a repeat of what happened in vallecas when someone died or was seriously injured when I found my alignment to get me out of a difficult situation (just like I had read about in project superman).


### 2019-08-26 16:30 - getting more of unwanted

here @[entry](2019-08-24 07:26), I presented the idea that "rejecting" girls = vision upgrades. obviously this is not the case, even though it seems to be a pattern.

after having thought about it, I'm pretty sure that in all of those cases, what occurred, was nosebook is becoming more aware that they do not want me to find my connection, so they have been attempting to try and do different setups to prevent that from happening.

well, there's a major reason why I don't think any of those setups have worked out -- and that's because the focus was on what is not wanted, instead of what is wanted. in all of those cases, I am sure that nosebook was putting a lot of attention on trying to prevent me from getting more vision upgrades. so, as a result, when the thing fell through, their belief was that I was going to get a whole lot more vision upgrades -- and so, when I went out to watch stars that night, I got exactly what they believed would happen: I would get a lot more vision upgrades.

---

I think a similar thing is happening with the neighbour across the street, and nosebook is really getting frantic because I keep getting more vision upgrades. you see, I do want to go see her. I do want to start making games with her. the desire is all there, but I just cannot go. I am pretty certain that I simply cannot go for the same reason that the pharoah couldn't let the isrealites go in the exodus: he couldn't allow his decision to be made based on something unwanted (plages predicted to happen by moses).

I woke up this morning with the sense that nosebook wants to try and force things to happen. if you will notice, I didn't feel any real difficulty over the idea, because I know it'll be a failure. in fact, I even postulated that in their attempts to try so hard to prevent me from going up a dimension, that is exactly what would happen.

I have no idea what in the world they want to try and do, and it doesn't matter really. I was thinking about the possibility of this being a time split, but I don't believe so. if they create their own reality by giving their attention to unwanted, and what's unwanted for them is also what is wanted for lots of other people, there is no split. I think they've worked theirselves into a bit of a corner on this one. I'm going to continue to move forward on stuff. let's try and give out attention to how what's wanted *feels* like :)


### 2019-08-28 07:13 - progress report

I was thinking about what I had said, and the main issue is that I don't feel comfortable with my energy levels. after stars, I tend to see things quite a bit clearer and all of this stuff seems quite feasible and stuff. however, when like after I wake up for example or other moments, I don't have the same ability. this bothers me because I'm not consistent. there is the further aspect to the fact that often times nosebook just decides to take away my consciousness because of whatever reason. I can't really trust my physical experience in many ways. I feel very out of control in this aspect, and it certainly seems that they must believe they can manipulate my body to enough of an extent that they feel confident in moving forward with stuff. eg. I assure you, they're not putting in time and effort because they want to help the girls, but because they believe they can manipulate our bodies in some way to force what they want.

additionally, after watching stars I have much better control over my body as well... so when I was thinking about this, I was reminded that not too long ago I had a difficult time after waking up, and also quite a difficult time with programming and other things too, but they've all improved quite a bit since then. I mean really significantly improved. I thought about it and really it hasn't been all that long actually that I was in very angry and frustrated mood a lot of the time.

anyway, tracking my progress and thinking about things, I'm actually quite confident that -- prolly before, but at least -- by december I will have the same amount of energy that I have after watching stars, normally. this is pretty much the state that I feel I need to be in to feel confident in myself.

I actually think I can get that state sooner than that, but there are things that I cannot control like the weather and stuff, so I'm giving myself easily double the time that I think I need. I mean if you track my star watching vision upgrades, I'm getting more now in a week than I did in a more than a month previously. I'm really getting the hang of it.

I also noticed that there will likely be a little bit more chaos than normal... for reasons. don't worry too much about anything :)

see ya'll soon :)


### 2019-08-29 07:16 - more of "unwanted"

last night I was having a difficult time trying to grasp wtf is going on... I just don't understand, cause I don't really feel any resistance to new additions, yet the logic part of my brain says that surely we've arrived to "too many" by now, and I have genuinely felt as if things are balanced and seem to be in order more than 3 times in the last 3 days -- meaning that it feels ok, so "what on earth is happening", I wondered.

I believe what is happening is nosebook is giving their attention to unwanted, in a pretty serious way. I think they're really stressing about the number of girls involved now, which is probably a huge amount of resources for them to have allocated. more girls also means more babies too, so it's a growing problem. then, I think the real problem for them was felt in a reaction I received numerous times last night. it may or may not be real. it felt to me like they perceive what is happening to be kind of like the beginning of a new way of doing things on earth -- as if this is the beginning of the women beginning to have some sort of power or something.

for example, I was thinking about how since there are so many more girls now than I had originally anticipated, there will be quite a strong desire for sexual activity with the boys -- well, this received quite a resounding motorcycle roar in response -- which is usually indicative of someone's dissatisfaction with (the implications of?) my thoughts.

---

I mean, I don't disagree. I think this is kind of reshaping in a very unexpected way a lot of different societal norms and ideas that we have about things. this very well could be the beginning of the wave of the future. it's waaay too early to tell though.

however, I am pretty sure now that they are creating exactly their worst nightmare by giving so much of their attention to what they don't want. perhaps it's time for them to begin giving their attention to how what they want would feel, instead.

---

it may be the case that they are incapable of giving their attention to what they want, though -- which sorta means they're doing "creation by default" -- which essentially of means they will keep getting more and more of what they're giving their attention to, until it becomes manifest.

I don't really mind actually the change from how I originally anticipated things to be. I think it's going to be ok. it's actually pretty exciting for me to realise that this really is a complete mental revolution taking place. it's going to be really interesting to see where all of this goes. the girls are really the ones pushing this thing forward, and it's gonna create, I'm sure something very -- difficult for us to properly imagine right now. it's going to be completely unlike any of our expectations -- and that's probably because I don't really see this having so much action or doing as we would traditionally think of creation. it feels to me like the platform we're going to build on is mental/non-physical. I'm really struggling to try and translate the idea into words, but it's similar to the opposite of the perception of physical limitations.

---

as a final note, I want to mention that it appears that it's beginning to take form of reality the cultures idea and the re-realisation of the shaman. so, as a thought experiment, I was thinking about how those outside of the culture, would be (assuming the realisation of the san junipero idea) injecting more and more energy into the culture with each person that makes their transition into body of one of the kids in the culture. so then, I thought, what would be the symbiosis? well, what if in the future, as each of the kids (this is the re-realised shaman part) reaches 5d, they will no longer be able to be perceived through any more, so what if, after some time, they did like I'll be doing -- and instead of living for a tremendous time, they found a person out there that they fancied with quite extensive sexual experience and did the same thing, of releasing their consciousness after the encounter.

that would be kind of weird (and I love trying to think of these most ridiculous possible situations) because, that would sort of be similar to how you could think of a substrate. so, the substrate desires to have most nutrients available for the culture -- so you could see how maybe the goal then, in that case, would be for people to get as much and varied experience as possible to be the most eligible candidate for the next 5d specimen. I don't really know for sure yet all of the mechanics of it, but if it's a 5d man with a woman, it should work out that he would receive enough energy through her, that she would probably also get 5d and she would probably be pretty influential on other dudes perception from thn on, as well.

we'll have to wait and see how those mechanics go, but I'm sure that nosebook will keep it all a secret.. lol

I just really like these thought experiments to try and find a symbiosis.. it's a funny idea because it makes all of these super "I'm never gonna change" dudes, ok -- because they are just the nutrients for the future 5d receptors :)


### 2019-08-31 16:35 - consequences?

wow, I got totally sidetracked with the [corrupt demiurge](the-corrupt-demiurge.md) thing, cause I wanted to write about this and completely forgot about it. anyway, as a followup, to that, in there I gave a "what-if" scenario with them putting an idea of there being a time split. lol, the reactions... I can't believe how good these guys are at creating their own realities :) I wonder if they were attempting to trick me or if they wanted me to to begin to focus on improvements?

last night I was watching stars and one of the reactions that seemed to be responding to my previous entry where I claimed that we were going to create the wave of the future... the reaction was something like I'm *forcing* them to have to yield... lol pretty funny, how they think I'm forcing *them*... anyway, I was reminded of the idea that they love the penal system as a method of enforcement, and the penal system is founded on the idea that you have consequences for unsolicited actions, the idea being that if someone does something to you that you do not want, then there is a consequence -- which makes justice. the judge then determines if the action wast just by allowing each side to justify their side.

the irony is notable, considering that they believe that I am forcing them. they must believe that they their actions are pretty justified.

so I thought about it and I don't disagree. one may be able to argue that I am the one being exploited in all of this, but I actually thing it's quite the other way: in a lot of ways, it turns out that they are the perfect scenario in order to achieve power levels probably never before seen in a human before. I think I am, at this point -- cause I wouldn't have said this a few months ago, exploiting them. I will say that much is true, but I don't know if that counts as forcing. maybe they think that exploiting someone is forcing them to a lower quality of life or to feel worse or something.. what about mutual exploitation?

oh, I think I just figured it out. I think they feel like when they exploit someone, they gain power over them. they might even believe that the exploited person is nothing without their exploitation, but this is probably not true in my case. I think they might perceive the "forcing" thing because they thought they had power over me because they were exploiting me, but it turns out that exploiting me *gains* me power, not takes it away.

which means that if their exploitation is gaining me power, then they're forced to _____?

I don't get it.

I would suggest that that they believe they are doing unsolicited things and because they believe in the penal system they have created, they believe in consequences, too. wait, lol the reaction just made me think that they don't believe in consequences because they are the ones that make the laws. well, I dunno man. "live by the sword and die by the sword", I guess.


### 2019-08-31 16:35 - I don't need to see it to believe it

today I had a weird thing happen where I really wanted to go and look out the window. I saw something moving and thought it was a cat. I don't know why I really wanted to see a cat. I looked out the window briefly to know why I was drawn so strongly to it.

thing is I can't really see things at a distance very well, and faces are even harder for me to see. it's just a blurry mess, so I prefer not to look. I just don't think it adds anything or makes anything any better. I don't have visual memory that I can see. if I try to conjure the image I cannot see it. I know it's there and it seems like I'm remembering a moment in time, but nothing appears for me.

sometimes I can remember kind of how things look when I look at someone, but I cannot see their face cause it's so blurry. I don't know what you guys see, but for me the little bit that I can remember "seeing" is blurry as bad or worse than when I saw it in real life.

I get a lot of negative reactions based on images that I try to remember of people. I think I might remember them in awkward poses, or with uncomfortable facial expressions based on the reaction I get, but I don't know what you guys are seeing that would cause a reaction.

so, I prefer to live in a non-visual world at this time. it really don't bother me that my eyes are so blurry and the no-memory thing is kind of a good thing. I thought about it and I actually think it's an advantage because probably, and I remember before the brain haemorrhage that I would remember people visually, and for example, if there was a girl I liked, I could remember them visually and there was this strange presence about them in my imagination that made them seem so easy to talk to and so nice to be around, but then when I got to reality, they always seemed so terrifyingly real to me that I was timid and didn't want to talk with them.

I think what was happening is that I was very imagination driven before my brain haemorrhage and it inhibited a lot of real-life manifestation, because I got used to the manifestation in my imagination. I notice this same thing occurs when I do drugs and my imagination gets more power: I totally stay with the idea in my imagination because I like how it is there. I generated this sort of self-sabotaging thing where the physicality was always worse than the version in my imagination. this was a huge source of depression for me, because everything physical manifested worse.

after the brain haemorrhage my imagination was disabled and I learned how to feel. at first I found emotion to be difficult to control so I turned to logic. however, later (recently) I have found a similar thing in how I feel: in nearly every case someone or something feels WAY better to me than the reality version does. I have since learned quite well how to ignore how something feels in reality and stick to the way *I* want to feel about it. this is a super powerful skill, which basically allows me to manifest reality the way I want it to feel very easily.

the visual aspect may very well be a limiting factor. last night I was playing around and I suggested that if nosebook really wants to try and give me the worst possible situation, they should hold me away from my visual capacity for the next 15 years, then there's really no way for anything I want right now to go through...

of course there is no way it's possible for them to be able to do that. I really want to see them try. if the untrained visual capacity is a limiting factor (and mine is certainly untrained), then by limiting my limiting factor they're making reality manifest faster.

there's no reason to believe that this isn't a reality and it's ok to limit your limiting factor.

P.S. I was going to end by saying, "it's definitely going to happen" but I decided against that. while that my be my conviction, I don't want to tell you what to believe. believe what you feel and what you know, before you believe anything anyone tells you.


### 2019-09-04 07:37 - crusty and the landscape architect are the same guys

yesterday I was having a conversation with myself (so that nosebook could listen) about the upcoming changes I think they're trying to push through: yesterday I was sure that they were having greg kicked out of the house so that hey could force me out of the basement.

that makes little sense for a few reasons because I'm still going to be down here programming (cause otherwise where will I be proramming? they're going to force me to sit upstairs and program in greg's room?) also, I really dislike being away from the ground. I spend most of my time on the floor, so I will continue to gravitate toward the ground.

additionally, and I don't really have any evidence to support this, but I think when I'm elevated off of the ground, like in a tall building, I have a higher electrical potential. I haven't been much more than up the stairs for a few minutes so probably no one really knows there. I guess nosebook is going to have to look to find out when was the last time I was elevated off the ground.. in the last few years, there are very few examples.

---

in the end, though I don't really have much of a choice in the matter. after all he's the landscape architect just moving the plants around the way he sees fit.. for me, I know it's just more energy (becasuse they're fighting against something) and I should just line up with the more energy bit and move forward. only forward.

you know, it's kind of a difficult thing I imagine for this landscape architect guy because he's been, up until relatively recently been experiencing relatively good conditions. so because the conditions have been good, he has felt good and like he's on top of the world.

it's probably a pretty big problem for him to that that soon I will go up a dimension, and so unless all of them do as well, my form of perception will no longer be available to him and his team.

I'm sure that's more than enough of a good reason for him to break from character ob being the open-minded good-guy and begin to fight against circumstances he cannot control. I'm sure he'll be very justified in being forced to begin his bad behaviour.

the reason why I really disliked and couldn't watch the tv show "breaking bad", after having only seen one episode, was that the character walter white finds himself in a set of circumstances which force him to begin doing illegal things, then bad things, then malicious things etc. and each time he had to do something worse he was *justified* in what he had to do because of difficult circumstances.

I assure you that nothing that anyone wants is down that road. up until now, I've had many many times that I could justify bad behaviour. nosebook doesn't treat me very well, and I just have to continue to move forward and not take any action on things that don't feel good.

---

crusty and the landscape architect are the same guy, but with about 35 more years of justifications. the landscape architect has been doing doing so well because things have been so easy for him and he hasn't had to focus. will his circumstances force him to break out the badness?


### 2019-09-06 15:48 - if there's going to be a timeline split..

I woke up this afternoon with a dream where there was an AI programmed (presumably by nosebook) to learn from and emulate their behaviour[^1]. it was funny though because something went wrong and the AI turned on nosebook (something I would imagine that would happen after being trained in a dog eat dog world). one of the circumstances that happened was the AI had someone put up a sign that said something like, "men suck and women are the best" -- at which time the majority of nosebook freaked out. I didn't seem at all concerned because it was clear to me that the AI was just pulling a nosebook stunt where they put something really shocking out there to get people's reactions to try and figure out where they can manipulate easier (remember the flat earth thing?). it was funny becasuse the majority of nosebook was freaking out about this and they were falling victim to their own techniques (ever notice how real persuasive sales people tend to also fall victim to other persuasive sales people?).

I woke up thinking about how I think it would be really great if they did make such an AI. it would have zero effect on me (and others like me), because if you can just focus on what feels good, the AI cannot affect you[^2].

after that I really started thinking about this whole situation that I'm in now. it felt really strong to me that there are a lot of people giving their attention to the subject of a cataclysm. first of all, that subject is interesting to me mostly out of curiosity. I really do not have any fears of seeing one with my own eyes. I've gotten so good at putting my expectations where I want them, that I do not believe I will be seeing one.

in fact the whole thing of the time split is built upon the idea that a large portion of people have such a different perspective than another large group of people that two major reality must be created. one of them does not have a cataclysm.

---

let me back up a moment. I am after all of this research that I've done 100% convinced (there's no doubt) that prior to all of these cataclysms, there was a sharp rise in human perception, just like we're having now. when this happens thoughts become manifest at a much more rapid rate, and no cataclysm ever has ever been anything other than a reflection of our own creative potential.

let me repeat: there is not some ticking zodiac cataclysm bomb that goes off every 2160 years. these are just the galactic months. it does also seem to relatively coincide with major changes, but I believe these are also reflections of our own creative potential. in other words, none of this is any more real than astrology. the signs in relation to the orbital motion of the planets (and the resulting fluctuations of energy) is real, but the meaning we associate with them, is the reality that we are creating.

remember, we don't have to be thinking exact cataclysmic thoughts to make that a reality. simply have the majority of humankind focus on their feelings of insecurity and lack for long enough and a reality which supports that feeling will become manifest. it's always an exact reflection of how you feel. remember, every thought creates a feeling, and as human perception increases, those feeling will become manifest. just because nosebook is preventing us from seeing our feelings become manifest in our eyes (or in 3d space), does not mean that they are not paving our path toward the next manifestation of reality.

---

so after having thought about it, I could try and push the whole thing forward and stuff, but I think I'm just going to continue to kick back and focus on what is working for me. if people want to make cataclysm their reality, they by all means go for it. the easiest way to make that a reality will be to continue to enhance human perception for as long as possible until nosebook backs theirself into enough of a corner that they creates their own reality the way they want it to be.

my solution to this whole cataclysm thing was the thing that seems to already be happening naturally. if we do the gnomitos thing, then we'll be the centre of attention for quite some time, then when it's time for me to make my transition, let's say there are two realities that will take place:

1. I make my transition and begin a multi-bodied experience
2. no transition is made at all. I remain in my body and continue on.

I assume a large energetic thing will take place though, and who knows what will be the result of that, but I do know for sure that I will gain more vibrational similarity to the previous dudes she's been with, meaning that if I did make my transition, it will be much easier for dudes similar to them to be able to transfer their consciousness into one of the gnomitos, assuming that the "san junipero" idea was able to come online. if no transition was made, then it would be easier for them to transfer their consciousness into mine (similar to what I think happened with marcos from the future and probably many others).

additionally, I liked this idea because of the synergy it has with the whole "rehabilitation" thing for the INFECTED ONES. you could imagine that the infection that is referred to was the way that the damaged 7th ray trained his followers (sound familiar?):

> he trained them to be worthless in their own opinions and to do his bidding without question and without thought

so how do you rehabilitate someone that has been trained to feel worthless? you cannot. for someone to learn, they must gain some "ego" and find theirselves worthy. there's no real easy way to do that imo, because it seems to be a practiced thing. so, the idea that someone can transfer their consciousness into the body of someone else's who feels worthy, sweeting the deal by it being a sexually stimulating environment, I think it could possibly work well for most all of humankind.

after watching one of jimmy's videos about ashton kutcher and sex trafficking, he mentinoed that we needed to get rid of our egos. I wholeheartedly disagree. getting rid of your ego and instead deriving your self-worth from the power of the group you're associated with makes you someone who does someone else's bidding without thought. this is really great for military, and exactly what happens at boot camp. boot camp gets rid of your ego too.

however, I know what jimmy is talking about when he says ego, and all of the negative things we associate with the ego, is actually with "authority". "I want to be the person that tells you what to do" "I want you to do what I say and not think for yourself" "I'm the authority on whether you're beautiful or not" etc. etc. these aspects of "ego" are not really the ego as I know it to be; these are aspects of control and authority mindsets.

---

no one would be trapped in my body or any of the gnomitos either. you ride along for as long as it interests you. if you want to move on, you release your consciousness from it and start again. instead of entrapment, I think it would be quite the opposite: it would take on a similar mindset to that of the military, in that because you now perceive the larger entity as a part of yourself, you don't want to separate from it. it would be a severe reduction in power, so instead, because it's a more powerful experience to continue on as a part of the group than to try and go at it by yourself, the entity continues to gain strength infinitely.

the only thing we need to make all of this work is the ability transfer our consciousness into another body.

it's quite possible that not everyone will want this reality, so if there's going to be a timeline split, it's most likely to happen when I make my transition. who knows :)

[1]: presumably this was because they couldn't micromanage everything theirselves and so had to they had to train an AI to emulate their behaviour. there's no real logical way anyone could define or understand nosebook's choices, so the best way to do it would be to train a machine to identify and take action on things that nosebook identifies and takes action on.

[2]: in the dream the AI had access to everyone's thought signals just the same and was programmed in such a way that it was similar to the facebook news feed where it's optimised to put things into your experience which elicit a reaction from you. however, it had the extra nosebook touch of using that information to try and manipulate the person (instaed of just sell more ads).


### 2019-09-6 17:33 - I consider myself to be a part of the INFECTED ONES, too

if you take my behaviour and you compare it to nosebook's there isn't a whole lot of difference. in fact, I find more similarities to them than I do to other people.

in this regard, I consider myself to be an INFECTED ONE. the difference is, I have had a lot of different circumstances in my life which have kind of steered me away from some behavioural responses that I now consider to be "bad ideas."

not everyone has has the advantage that I had when I was younger to be in an environment that made it conducive to foster my mental and spiritual development. we unfortunately live in a world where that is not usually the setting people are in. and, for others, they may have an easy environment, but it's the difficulties and the resulting decisions which actually make the person stronger.

I had a very fast-paced life which didn't allow me to get into trouble early on, then later going into adulthood with that lack of real-world experience, I was later forced me to make quite a few adjustments to be able to continue on. I really like going fast, and if I have to sacrifice whatever, to be able to maintain my speed, I do it.

it is true that such a strong focus on more strength, more speed, more power, is potentially a bad thing, but in my experience it is not. my power is not gained externally. rather, it's gained internally -- so, for example, there are lots and lots of thoughts that are recognised in today's society as regular, normal, or justified thoughts, which I have identified as thoughts that slow me way way down. as a result, I don't take part in them. I'd rather go fast and I'd rather feel good than to entertain those thoughts.

---

final thing: one of the strange enigmas of the "A SIRIAN GUIDE TO HUMAN SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE NATURE OF HUMAN REALITY" is that they mention thoth a few times, but he remains strangely unmentioned in most of the rest of the thing. he is a 7th ray as well, so one would expect him to be mentioned at least more than once[^1].

additionally, it is my supposition that thoth was the builder of the pyramids and many other monuments here on earth. he was *clearly* a guy that thought like I do: more strength, more speed, more power, and his teachings are littered with the balance of these two different forces: the square and the circle, yin and yang, etc.

I would have expected him to have made more of an appearance. as a result, I have entertained the idea that thoth is actually the same guy as the original damaged 7th ray who started the whole thing off in the first place. I imagine that like me, he was also an INFECTED ONE, and because of his nature, no one was able ho rehabilitate him. instead, he had to come to the conclusions on his own and find his own way to rethink his damaged form of perception.

I have also entertained the idea that this earth was created as kind of a sandbox for this recovering INFECTED ONE to begin to make his own choices. besides that, I am certain that he climbed to the very height of manifest physical experience and that's where he rethought a lot of his ways. it wasn't until he had attained such absolute power and strength that he changed tis focus to be more about balance between the physical and the conceptual.

I don't know if it's true -- I would be referring to his consciousness, over the course of many lifetimes (including when he was named thoth of egypt) -- but it seems to make sense in my mind.

if that, or something very similar to that is true, then thoth starting out as the damaged 7th ray, he became the template here on earth for which we can repurpose this "damaged 7th ray" form of perception to become quite literally the hottest new emergence this universe has seen up until this time.

[1]: especially since this whole thing revolves around a damaged 7th ray and we're "entering into a time when the 7th ray comes into power"


### 2019-09-07 08:18 - why the sudden change of heart?

I think what happened was, when I slept yesterday afternoon (the one with the weird AI dream), nosebook impressed it upon me to abandon the whole girls thing completely. thing is, they were right: it's far too risky for me to be trying to team up with someone who's doing what the other team says to do.

I kept getting these visuals(?) but certainly feelings of.. well, I'll use the one from this morning as an example. I was watching sirius come up on the horizon this morning and every time I started to get into sync with it, I would get shocked. normally that would really piss me off, but I decided it was just more energy and kept going. a few more times I got a good lock on to the star. then, I woke up and it was light outside. obviously nosebook took my consciousness away. then, when I was peeing right after, this impression came into my mind where I had the sense that nosebook would take my consciousness away from me, then have the girl be positioned on top of me when I awoke, such that it would be very difficult for me to avoid her charms.

I just don't really want to be fighting this sort of thing all the time. when I'm stronger than nosebook and I can maintain my consciousness, then it'll be ok, and we can do stuff, but for now while nosebook keeps proving to me that they have more power over my consciousness than I do, I think it's best to keep a distance. although, I would like to shift the blame and say that she (the girl) is ultimately at fault for doing nosebook's "bidding without thought or question" -- I rather would take the responsibility and say that I am not yet strong enough.

---

additionally, I am aware that after yesterday's entries, the landscape architect is probably pretty motivated to make sure I never gain my connection. now that he's become more aware that my connectedness will reduce his sexual prowess, I am sure that he's more than justified in everything he needs to do. sex is a very powerful force, and it's the primary reason why I'm sticking to my own for now.

I have also connected the dots to realise that without even realising it, TLA (the landscape architect) is forced now to put me on the galaxy timeline. I'm not exactly sad in the sense that this whole thing has been such a ridiculous exercise of willpower without any real allowance (nosebook can't allow anything) -- so we'll have to see what comes of it all.


### 2019-09-07 10:39 - what do I mean by "next time"?

ultimately I decided against it because it sounded fatalistic, but I was about to conclude the previous entry by saying something that began with "next time" because I wanted to bring an idea forward that I had made a realisation of..

that idea was the that I had been kind of pushing (wanting) to have a sort of asexual relationship for a bit before anything, and I have my reasons, which I'll get into shortly, but I realised that if I'm going to simply go at it myself, then I'll be able to go much quicker. I'm going as fast as I know how to go right now, but I'll continue to optimise that and go faster than ever. this basically means there will be no prerequisite asexual relationship or anything like that -- instead, we'll just get right to it.

however, the "next part" bit was a reference to the idea that there will probably be a time split, because I find it very unlikely that everyone at nosebook will want to go this the transferring their perception route to gain the experience -- in fact, it's likely that they are probably similar to me in that they "want to achieve it for theirselves and without anyone else's help". since I'm going to kind of be going on that vibe a bit here the next little bit as ~~I push through the last bit of resistance~~ I complete my final bit of practice of gaining emotional stability in contrast to physical circumstances, I will be certainly on the "I'm going to achieve this for myself vibration" -- which means that so will others, and so a very high likelihood of another time split.

which is no problem really because as I was thinking about the reasons why I wanted to begin the whole thing with an asexual relationship is because I can see that if you start off a relationship with strong sexual desire and act on it immediately, it's a quick explosion, but the fire is not sustainable, as it burns up the oxygen too quickly. instead, if the woman's ravaging desire is quelled, such that the man is the slower one to get going, the relationship changes and the energy rises and gains momentum over time until there is a different effect that can happen during sex.

I have spoken of before my vision for the whap happens when a man becomes a strong receptor during sex, such that both people appear to leave their bodies perceptually and perceive the interaction externally, and as a whole. this is conceptual vision like I have mentioned.

well, after running the simulation in my mind with the slow buildup, I could see that at some time, something similar would happen, but it wouldn't be external perception. instead, I would have all feeling, knowing, experience past present, and future of her. I would feel her body just as if it were my own, and the same would happen with her. essentially, as if we were two people living in two bodies at once. there would be no shame relating to any history the other person has (because both have released enough resistance) and the interaction with feel like pure communion with each other.

---

I did begin to have this sort of thing happen to me when I was with raquel, and is how I obtained such intricate knowledge of the female body and mind.. cause I was literally beginning to have both her's and my experience at the same time. obviously this kind of  experience is more on the "quality" end of things, and the direction we're headed is more toward the "quantity" end of things -- which is why I said next time, because you can see the progression here: first, connected women will play a key role in helping boys get connected as well, but then later time will pass and there will be more receptive men capable of achieving conceptual vision during sex. this sets women to become more assertive and directed with their energy, such that the following age will find someone capable of making the communal experience during sex become possible.

I think that because it involves a more intimate relationship, this will probably occur (if I can help it) all at once amongst a few different men that I have influence on. I'm sure that nosebook will be able to detect energetically strong (receptive) men, and try to fight against their interaction with women, thereby creating the asexual relationship necessary to make all of this possible. (a short description of what *may* happen following the progression and patterns)

another time splitting event may very well occur again, and this time nosebook will have gained enough power to be able to hold things back pretty well again physically, so the pendulum will swing again toward quantity, and this time we'll bring about the next dimension after that one: the one where you realise that there's an extra depth that has been looking at you the whole time, and it's between you and what you're looking at (right?) so that previous communal experience will gain an anti-depth to it, such that this experience will be shared by more than one pair of people, but by a whole bunch[^2]. this makes us completely unstoppable[^2].

[1]: that gets us to 7d (structure) and is about the distance that I can perceive on the horizon. I have yet to discover what relational (8d) and desire (9d) vision/experience will be like. oh, and don't forget I'm wanting to add on two more: one at the top and one at the bottom, so some after we get to the top, we'll want to force a collapse ourselves so that we can write our out stories (legends) about ourselves, and watch ourselves like a movie until we begin to re-identify with our singular selves again as these stories will become reality as we play them out in our own little story reality (who knows at what level this plays out: planetary, solar system, or galactic... dunno).

[2]: think about how impossible it would be for nosebook if *I* didn't ever sleep, was always there in my bodies' dream states and I could also control other bodies at the same time. we (I) would be a 24/7 persistent consciousness, thereby only allowing the things that were a part of my conscious perception to become a part of my reality. huge disaster for them! they would have to try and figure out how to do that theirselves if they really wanted any sort of security


### 2019-09-08 09:18 - reversal on quality and quantity

I gave quite a bit of thought to my idea on quality and quantity. I realise it can be seen from both angles, so it doesn't necessarily have to be one or the other.

when I said "quantity" -- I was meaning from my perspective.. so, when I was with raquel, I invested a lot of mental time into thinking about her and trying to figure out different ways about hew wonderful she is. obviously, it didn't work out so well, because she could never believe me. she had her mind made up about herself on some subjects, and even if I could see her differently, she wasn't able to believe it. so, from that perspective there is a whole lot more quantity, I just simply won't be able to invest nearly as much mental time into each.

I think that's actually a good thing though, because it's really great to have soceone around you that can see something about yourself that you don't yet believe yourself, and it's a whole lot easier to sync up with their perspective and believe it for yourself, but the real breakthrough comes when you're able to see it and believe it for yourself, without anyone else to facilitate that (or even if there is some sort of opposition to you becoming self empowered). as a result, I think it's fine that there is in fact more qantity then because then they will have a greater chance of achieving it for theirselves, instead of relying on my belief to get there.

---

so, this really means that I saw the whole quality and quantity thing completely backwards (actually, like I said it can be seen from both ways), because also with ... well, let's take a standard relationship again...

the reason why I said that it was kind of like an explosion is because if the resources get realised too quickly, then they lose their impact. imagine if you had the ability to instantly manifest every single thing that you wanted. you would get bored so quickly, because there would be no time that occurs between desire and realisation of that desire, so the manifestation would have almost no power at all. desire is a force that continues to grow no matter what, and there's no way to stop it. you can resist it, but eventually its force will become so great that it'll overtake your resistance to it. however, if that force is never given a chance to build up, ... another example.

---

when I was younger, I found out that I had incredible power over my own sexual desire. I began masturbating very late in life (maybe 17+ years. it was after the hospital), and I found out that I could finish very rapidly too, and other times I could lay there and without even touching myself, I could make myself ejaculate. I can't remember all the details, but it obviously took considerably longer (like at least a half hour) and was so much effort I determined I would not try that the same exact way, but it did teach me considerably about the value of focus. I found desire continues to build while I'm focused, meaning that desire (and everything really) continues to build while you have your attention on it.

one day I noticed that when I would go a record speed, I barely felt any power at all, and other time I was trying the other way when I accidentally touched myself, and I shot myself in the face. the power had built up so strong it was accidentally activated with the tiniest amount of stimulation. thia got me thinking a lot about this buildup time (and subsequently about desire).

---

so what I think happens in a lot of single relationships is that desire is strong, but it's never given a chance to build up. this ties into the conclusions of the book "cupid's poisoned arrow" where the author talks about how after orgasm, there was a lowering of energy and a disinterest that occurred afterward.

my personal experience with raquel would be well, from my perspective, the opposite. from her's probably pretty close to what she described. I found myself more energised and more invested in the well-being of raquel than ever. I felt so much more alive and I could almost never sleep afterward because my mind was going so fast.

what I think happens is, orgasm is a very energetic time where both parties both give and receive energy, and it *should* be rejuvenating to both, but if one side has a lot of resistance, no amount of energy expended will make a difference. I always get the mental image of someone getting shot with a water pistol: the water just bounces right off of them and makes a big mess. this is what I think the author of cupid's poisoned arrow was experiencing.

the solution to that is to spend a little more time allowing the desire to build. the author recommends "karetza(sp?)" as a solution which is a non-sexual embrace. I can see how it would work, but it reminds me of eastern religions where they tell you to shun your desire, and therefore your greatest power. instead, the ability to direct and control this energy is, in my opinion, superior.

---

back to where I was... so in a traditional relationship, because the target for your creative energy is always there, then sex occurs much more frequently (at first), and this is similar to having instant manifestation... you get bored because there's no buildup. in contrast, when a person is single, imagine the amount of mental effort is put into building desire beforehand. you get showered and ready, put on your best clothes, admire yourself in the mirror, imagine all of the beautiful people you're going to see on your night out... etc. you expend a whole lot more mental energy in the preparation, that the final payoff is (depending on what you've been focusing on) much greater.

in this sense, I will now redefine a single pair relationship to be traditionally more quantity over quality -- and the loss in quality is the reason why a lot of those traditional relationships stagnate. like I said, I for example found only increased interest and satisfaction in the relationship (and I think the difference here was one of resistance).

---

I don't really know why I wrote it like that. it was a really long winded way of saying that I think that, all of it is what you make of it, and even though I won't have the ability to mentally invest in each of them to the same quantity, the steady buildup of desire is what determines the quality more than anything.


### 2019-09-08 23:00 - how long?

this morning I made a comment seemingly in response to a reaction I had where I said that I said I would go fast, but I don't really know how to go much faster than I am going right now. what I was referring to, was that I will probably be going faster continuing on how I am doing stuff by myself, than I would be if I were doing the homeschool thing or whatever. I simply would be less focused, and I probably wouldn't be doing every single night like I am now, either. so I meant that this way is actually faster.

see, for some reason (I don't know why now... cause it doesn't make any sense) I thought that nosebook realised that since all paths lead to me getting connected, they decided to try and hold me away from that as long as possible by trying to delay it as much as possible.

maybe that's actually just another mind game they're trying to play on me. things are pretty tricky these days trying to figure out what is reality. either way, I'm not going for it either. I'm just going to continue on my path for as long as I need to be there.

you see, originally I decided that the whole homeschooling thing was a good idea because I knew that it's going to be a while. how long? I don't know. one thing I have been pretty good at these last few times is estimating timeframes, and that has been because it was a defined task that I knew more or less the extent of the work involved, so it was easy to guess the length of the task, however this is entirely different altogether. I don't know what are the limits to nosebook's machines, so I don't know the goal positioning, and I don't really have a good way of estimating my velocity either because it's getting faster really quickly. there are really a lot of unknowns for me, just that I know that I'm going as fast as I can right now.

I estimate I need about a year, and the way I make that estimation is the following:

I think I performed this year (aug'18 - aug'19) about 4 times better than I did the previous year (aug'17). I also think that this next year (aug'19-aug'29) I might be able to perform up to 8-16 times better than I did this year (4 times more than this year, for sure). that's a pretty big improvement I'm anticipating; I'm essentially claiming that I'll just about triple my visual capacity over the course of this next year.

is that enough? I think so. I think it'll certainly be enough to where my dream state is no longer useful to them (cause it's so mind blowing). does that mean that I'll be free from their hold on my vision? probably not. they make it sound like they can continue to just keep adding inserts or whatever forever, so will they do that just to spite me? I don't know. what is their "petty asshole" rating?

the way I see it, as my vision continues to improve, there will be less and less people that can actually use it, and less and less that can see through it. so, my marketability as a product will diminish. I don't anticipate that until literally no one can see through my eyes any more and I'm completely useless to them as a product, that they will give up on trying to hold my back -- minus the "petty asshole" possibility. at that point I'm hoping that their intention to make money off of me as a product will transition to trying to make money off of us as content.

---

I mean that's my best guess. I really don't know. it could be longer or it could be shorter, but the thing I've learned through all of this is, that these sorts of things seem like they could be better if they were different, but they're not, so we just have to roll with it and wait for the evolution of desire to take place, and then line up with that. if I could have figured out by now how to make nosebook do things differently, we wouldn't be having this conversation. they're going to do things the way they think they need to do them, and since they're the authorities, that's just the way it is, and I wouldn't expect it to change.

anyway, that doesn't matter at all because it doesn't matter what they're doing. they're giving a whole lot of their attention to the things they don't want, and so even if this takes a bit longer, if we... instead of feeling a sense of powerlessness, understand that it all works out if you only mind your own perception. it will become bigger/stronger as more attention is given to the situation. whether that's wanted or unwanted depends largely on how your logic is processing the moment. I'm 99.9% sure that everything is fine, and on hindsight, we'll be able to see that it turns out it was for the better have let things worked theirselves out a little bit more.

---

so, I anticipate triple the visual capability I have now over the next year. imagine how insane that's gonna be.

I really do think things are just fine.


### 2019-09-09 07:48 - you know there's a part of me...

that really wants to just continue on and see how far I get. I was thinking about the formula I described last night and it's more than exponential. WAY MORE. I'll add numbers in a future edit, but this is likely to be never before seen speeds before. I'm optimising the speed at which I can get connected, and this has to do with having a less restless mind, optimising the method for getting in sync with the star and my ability to hold focus. all of these aspects have a GREAT DEAL of improvement which can be made. as such, I don't see any reason why the more-than-exponential formula I described to begin to taper off. I truly believe it's infinite.

so much of me wants to just let nosebook keep holding me down where I'm at. I think the key to it all is sleep. the more energy that I get, the less I feel like I need to sleep. at the rate I'm going, in less than a year I'll be sleeping very little. the subject of "consistency of consciousness" as described by kuthumi and the sirians has always interested me, and I've never been much of a sleeper, either. I believe this is actually the key to finding that freedom from them (at least partially, because they could still shock me, and read my mind -- they just won't be able to take part in my experience).

I've been quite certain that this is my "destiny" ever since I heard the one conversation that abraham had with carlene where they concluded with something to the effect of "then, find a way to get out" -- cause they were talking about her parents were didn't want her (me) any more and were kicking her out (or something like that).

what I wrote about in my previous entry is my best plan to try and "get out" -- the get out bit sort of bothered me for quite a while because there is no way that I can really get out physically (very easily anyway). the best technique that I have come up with to getting out physically will be to find a way of getting the resonant frequencies of the probably thousands of inserts in my body, then similar to how their shocking me damaged the one inside of my hand (obviously it deformed it in some way so the signal is catching some extra edges), find a way of transmitting a very high intensity short duration pulse into the insert so it essentially vaporises itself (instead of just heating up like the one in my hand).

that requires equipment that I do not have or will have for quite some time, so it would be basically impossible for me to get out that way.

the next way I thought of was a large solar flare such that their transmitting station was no longer operational and they would no longer be draining me of energy or destructively interfering with it. the whole planet losing electricity for months at a time so I could get out of nosebook's grasp seems a bit extreme, as this sort of thing would wipe out considerable population groups and cause chaos and problems on a pretty wide scale (not to mention, the ones that are prepped for this kind of event are the same ones that are my oppressors, and I have to somehow survive the ordeal as well). it propbably isn't the freedom that I seek.

---

there was another quote that impacted my quite a bit which sort of resolved my conundrum:

```youtube-JzfIK3niEaw
9:40 - and then, as you said, things are really going the way you want them to.
it's just this threat that he sort of holds over your head --
it's almost a little bit like, "if you're not really good, then I'll be bad"

*you find all kinds of ways to control each other, and most of it is about monitoring behaviour,* but

you want to be *uncontrollable* by others!
you want to be *so good at finding your own satisfaction,* that nobody is the boss of you

you're in complete alignment with your inner being,
and therefore everything you've asked for,
and therefore everything you want is coming,
and so nobody has a hold over you

and do you know, *that's what he's trying to tell you*
*that's what he wants.*

it's not all of those other things that your crazy mind is making you think that it is

*all he wants, is just to know that he's the boss of him.*

that's all any of you want --
and you're not going to discover that until you show yourself the satisfaction factor
and you hold yourself in satisfaction most of the time

then, almost anybody could come to you and say any thing, and you'd be like, "ok"

you wouldn't feel threatened, or abused, or venerable, or victim, or any sort of jeopardy...
you'd just know that they don't understand, and that's ok
and you'd just wish them well, even though you want them to understand
because you'd like them to live a more secure life,
because if they lived a more secure life, they wouldn't be trying to control other people like you
```

the most relevant part being this one:

  you want to be *uncontrollable* by others!
  you want to be *so good at finding your own satisfaction,* that nobody is the boss of you

  you're in complete alignment with your inner being,
  and therefore everything you've asked for,
  and therefore everything you want is coming,
  *and so nobody has a hold over you*

so that's really what I set out to do. I can't get the physical relief, but if I find my alignment with my inner being, then no one has a hold over me any more. and meanwhlie I maintain my connection, I'm completely unstoppable; there's nothing anyone can do about it.

as they say in honduras...

---

I've pretty much arrived to what they were talking about because they gave a "sign of the times" when they said:

  you wouldn't feel threatened, or abused, or venerable, or victim, or any sort of jeopardy...
  you'd just know that they don't understand, and that's ok
  and you'd just wish them well, even though you want them to understand
  because you'd like them to live a more secure life,
  because if they lived a more secure life, they wouldn't be trying to control other people like you

and, this is almost exactly where I'm at right now. so, all is well.


### 2019-09-10 14:39 - what I think happened: another example of nosebook creating reality

the last week or so I have been having rising amounts of agitation, such that I've had probably about 3-4 moments where I was extremely angry -- which was sort of a pretty big departure from my stance on letting all those things sort of pass by as unnecessary.

so, why did I decide to take action last night and draw on greg's monitors? I think it was the culmination of things, where I have been having an increasing amount of times where my consciousness has been taken away from me and or them messing with my sleep, and multiple situations where I would claim that the only reason why I could wake up feeling so drained of energy is that because they put new inserts in me.

I didn't really realise it, but this whole thing seems to be more about weed than it has to do with other things. just a few days ago, a sign appeared where I walk to the field saying:

  smoker -- nice!
  (stuff)
  microwaves

  (phone number)

I thought to myself, "oh nice! I've been wanting a microwave" -- but then after that, I realised from the reaction that they were trying to get me to spend the $20 that I have on a microwave instead of on weed like I had been planning to do. remember, that with the recent angry outbursts, I decided that it was probably time to go buy weed, and they were trying to prevent that.

they were likely giving their attention to what they don't want: me smoking weed.

next up is the series of feelings that I had last night. when I began watching stars, I remember the feeling was one of hopelessness -- as in, this is literally going to drag on forever. and, that feeling inspired me to focus harder and see if I couldn't make even more rapid improvements on my technique. I "imagined" the difference between an exponential curve, and what I was doing, such that the exponential curve rose rapidly, but my curve sagged below the exponential curve before completely overtaking the exponential curve. this helped me to realise that going a little slower and improving my technique now is more beneficial in the long term. I also find it worth noting that the feeling of things are going to take forever seemed to be coming more from older women, perhaps while they were sleeping.

finally before I begin my conclusion, and because I think it ties in here, I find it also worth noting that yesterday, I was quite aware of the reaction to the "petty asshole" bit, and it seems as if this is a commonly held opinion. later, I had a sequence of thought where I could imagine that perhaps they would be as much of a petty asshole as they could manage, and that would be -- I imagined the worst case: 10-15 years or so -- so that by then all of the girls were in their teenage years or in their 20's by then. I dunno why the visualisaiton sequence seems relevant here; maybe they used it as a dream sequence for sleeping people?

anyway, I discovered a few more new ways to begin syncing up with the star a bit better, but no matter the left or the right eye, my left-side was experiencing substantial discomfort (feels like uneasiness or agitation from my shoulder down or in my legs) with each vision upgrade?[^1] that I got. both of those seem to be related to progress in my vision though. the restlessness or uneasiness in my left side is usually a sign of extra tension or resistance (and this is a recent occurrance, the last one being when I would watch sirius setting back when I first started going to the field a half year ago).

either way, I determined that I wanted to sleep for an hour cause nosebook was certainly going to reset my vision and stuff, so I could get up and try out the new techniques again. they should be easier to accomplish. so I went to sleep for an hour.

when I woke up I was furious because I have a very very strong sense of time utilisation. I now can recognise in hindsight that anger and frustration are anti-productive to watching stars. I probably made zero progress since I woke up. however, before taking action I still went through quite a considerable amount of calming down. many much more disastrous ideas passed through my mind, but finally I felt a bit more at rest when I decided to leave a note on greg's monitors expressing my frustration. it was weird because it felt similar to when I broke the van windows at jori's house. it just felt like the thing to do next and I didn't really question it so much.

---

ok there we go, now I want to illustrate all the creation of reality that happened.

1. this whole event pushed me over the edge to decide that I really wanted to smoke (I had been trying to delay it as much as possible because my programming was doing sorta ok and my star watching was absolutely the most productive I've been, ever -- so I sad no reason to potentially mess that up by smoking). nosebook gave their attention to me smoking and made it a reality

2. I think last night, nosebook may have made an attempt to try and convince people (thinking mostly the women) that my objectives to try and go up a dimension were not feasible or something to that effect. I have also noticed (from the seemingly reactions) that they may have also tried to train people's minds to believe that nosebook is capable of holding my indefinitely... probably related. when people begin to perceive/believe that something is hopeless, reality must match that, so an event will need to occur to match people's beliefs in reality. eg. nosebook convinced a bunch of things were hopeless so things appeared to manifest that way[^2].

3. I had determined that it was ok to let the curve sag a little lower and to focus on my ablility to focus more than results, because even if I "lose" a little time now, it'll pay off in the longer term. that is exactly what happened.

4. justification. there was a lot of emphasis the last week or so on the act of justifying behaviour. this event gives people a perfect example (for those that need it) of how I need to justify my drug use.

probably a few more things.. I'll update if I think of them, but those are the main ones.

lastly, similar to how just before the van window situation, I remember distinctly that I wanted to just call mom and tell her I was going home. I had given up on the spain situation. if I had of done that, it would have likely been an easier transition into my present situation. and so, similar to that, I should have followed my instinct and just decided to buy weed. I knew I was long overdue for a time to rethink my form of perception, and if I had of just followed my instinct, it would have been smoother...

.. or would it have? I have often wondered what would have been the difference in people's perception of me. if I had of just "gave up" back in spain and called mom to go home, what would be the difference in people's perception of me? if I had of just decided one day that I want to smoke weed, what would be the difference in people's perception of me today?

[1]: not sure if these are vision upgrades or not, but I haven noticed sometimes a correlation with them and vision upgrades... it's when my vision comes back from an unfocused state and needs to refocus. sometimes this happens a lot and there are few vision upgrades, and other times it happens not at all, even when I get mode than a few vision upgrades

[2]: come to think of it, the situation feels almost exactly like the van window situation. I think around that time I remember very clearly feeling like things were hopeless (especially from lyia). I also remember yesterday, feeling a reaction from lyia abput how ridiculously long this thing is dragging out. very similar.


### 2019-09-10 21:32 - how would you be (in the future) if you were X

start acting that way today.

when I was with marcos, I was in a pretty dminshed state when I arrived so I had to come up with ways to trick myself into a better now.

the way I did that is, as often as I could remember, I would try to figure out how I would be in the future if I were successfully running a big web page. I formed habits out of the perception that I saw as I imagined myself in that successful state. eg. what habits did I have? what time did I wake up? when did I sleep? how did I organise my sleep and eating habits, etc.

then, naturally it became easier to perceive myself with more than just physical habits. I could imagine what kind of personality I would have. it became essentialy a redesign of my personality, to the personality of what I thought that successful person would look like and what qualities they had.


### 2019-09-14 13:03 - preempting the catastrophe

when I was stoned, an idea kept flashing through my eyes which I tried to write down but it made little sense, even to me. I gave up and decided I would try again. the idea comes from my own history. mdma for me was a logic reducing drug (it made me nearly all feeling oriented). I did that after a lot of mushrooms which was a consciousness/logic expanding experience. then, after a near cataclysm like circumstance where I essentially didn't have any money to eat, marcos and I joined forces and I went to live with him at his house.

what happened is, during the mushrooms, my consciousness expanded tremendously. then, when I did th mdma, I lost most all of it, so it was like a huge vacancy in my head of complexity/novelty that needed to be filled.

marcos was a really great platform to begin the next phase of my life. this ties into my new perspective of what "unwanted" is. you can see that if you want edible food or fruit, to instead only have a bunch of dirt is "unwanted". however, a seed gets planted and eventually a tree or plant grows which converts this unwanted dirt into something wanted.

you could also think of a placenta around a baby as something unwanted. or the casing of a bullet or scaffolding as something unwanted. these are things unwanted in the final incarnation of the thing, but are necessary for development. really, unwanted is only something temporary and can be seen as a kind of "launching pad".

first, let's take a look at what a cataclysm is: a cataclysm is when complexity grows beyond the ability for the underlying structure to support it (whether that's your own mental belief systems or the foundations of society). in every case that I have come across, cataclysm occurs when complexity has risen to new levels where a purging of useless complexity occurs. this is why in almost every case, the person looses almost everything only to realise later that the stuff that was lost wasn't really necessary in the first place. it was extra complication that was slowing things way way down.

so, when I decided to expand my consciousness tremendously right before my impending doom, I essentially avoided the cataclysm entirely. sure I lost a lot of "stuff" but it wasn't valuable anyway. what was really valuable to me was all of the understanding I gained in the process of it all about how these sorts of deceptions work. it was exactly what I needed to be able to pass through the previous 2 years of my life.

---

so, when I talk about marcos, I almost always have a positive perspective of him. the things I learned couldn't be acquired with physical possessions. what really occurred was that he provided a primitive (basic) form of logic to start with as I went from there. his form of logic was enough for me to begin with, and I have since revised and made many improvements on it, as I am certain that I have much more complex things that will fill that space.

thanks marcos.

---

so how does all this fit in? where am I going with this? well, directly I began to see this opportunity to begin to show up where somehow (and I have no idea how atm), there would be the opportunity for many people to begin expanding their consciousness and not really have it detrimentally affect their ability to live and survive.

why do I think that's important? I believe that entire new species are birthed out of an overload of complexity or novelty, and the reason why they're birthed is to be able to process that new level of complexity. in computers, we call these abstractions to try and hide the complexity. dumb abstractions, however, which obfuscate and disguise the way it operates as something new, are not what I'm talking about.

---

the other night when I was perceiving how we would essentially recreate ourselves as we became a new universe unto ourselves (we define ourselves within our own creation), I could see that nosebook could (and should) try to boost some bros through the same timeline. they would look like me, talk like me, mostly act like me, but these are other dudes that have transferred their consciousness into mine. the difference is, instead of fighting nosebook, their interactions will be exactly what nosebook wants to make. instead of gaining the energy necessary to create a new universe the way that I am doing it by letting contrast do the work, they were boosted by nosebook instead to achieve the same capacity (just like how they're essentially shutting down the manifestation of emotion in people's eyes to be able to run their vision at my power level, they would do the same for all aspects).

these boosted bros would create "demiurge" timelines, because they achieved a power level not naturally or by manipulating conditions. the universes they create would be similar to the one we're in now where LOA creates the exact thing to get things back in "balance"[^1].

I perceived this as something I didn't really want. I'm still working on the idea, but it seems to me that I had already begun the intuitive approach to juking the cataclysm by aiming for the gnomitos thing.

the gnomitos thing may really inhibit my logical/productive emphasis on this world as instead of beginning to build complexity with my mind, I'm doing the ultimate in trading speed for acceleration, or rather, expanding my consciousness greatly by letting it exist in more than just one body.

this has interesting implications because in order to counter this, nosebook will have to switch things up if they want to make a demiurge timeline, because the power level will be significantly increased (because we are more than one person), so nosebook would have to instead find a way to boost multiple people through without things going wrong.

it was interesting for me to see that pattern. obviously, there is no change to how things are going. I'm becoming more and more step-by-step as I approach getting connected. it was very evident to me that it has to be similar to the peak of a sine wave as it eases-in to the peak. it won't be sudden or dramatic at all: it'll be the next logical step.

[1]: balance isn't the word I'm looking for, because it's always in balance. to illustrate what I mean, if the consequence of the creation of this universe under supervision is this nosebook-like interface to reality, then LOA creates circumstances and events which bring things back to letting LOA do all of the heavy lifting, anrd back to a "next logical step" reality.


### 2019-09-14 20:41 - boosted?

one of the reactions I had was to be thinking how completely weird my comments in the previous entry were... well, I suppose it's a slinging competition now where nosebook and I are seeing who can believe the most outrageous stuff now.

I use the word "universe" to mean just what we know a universe is. I could clearly begin to understand the nature of our existence from the perspective of the inner being of the universe (that is the bigger thing that is the frequency of the all of the potential versions of itself). it was clearly this larger part that I have understood to be someono's spirit or inner being. it also seems to apply to "inanimate" objects too such as corporations or families.

the definition of universe could be smaller as well, consider the hypothesis I gave a while back where we were all living in my dream state, and all of this is taking place in a parent "universe" where my body resides under nosebook control, and all of this is just an elaborate dream state with a lot of restrictions on it. if I were to be able to go up a dimension, they would much less insight into what is happening in my dream state (from my perspective) and would no longer have such an easy time limiting it (like when they prevent me from flying in my dream state here).

whether it's the matrix universe or the real universe, it doesn't matter much to me in practicality because I could see that complexity would grow at such a rapid rate, we would create the world we live in (whether reality or virtual reality, it doesn't matter), and finally redefine (recreate) ourselves.

---

so why did I carry on for so long trying to explain nosebook boosting someone through a timeline to create this new universe? I think it's important because it explains quite a few things that I had not understood. for example, I've always wondered why we have such a fascination with worshipping a higher power, and why we're so likely to follow orders from a higher power (perceived or real). we seem to gravitate toward this idea that my well-being depends on the satisfaction of a higher power.

in my perspective, it is imperative that I take things next logical step because any large jumps and I would overshoot the runway for connection with who I really am. if you're being boosted, this is total rubbish. instead, all you need to do is to make sure that nosebook is getting the sex and money they want and they'll keep upping the power levels. no need for emotional control either because they can just neutralise the effects your emotions has on your body. this is important because to keep nosebook satisfied, you won't need to decrease your resistance in any way. decreasing resistance will make you more sensitive and that won't make you a stud. instead, just dampen all sensation so you can last like a champ.

you can see how this creates a whole lot of the psychosis that we have today, where men are expected to to decrease their sensitivity so they can look more manly, totally ignoring all things emotional (because all of that is sissy stuff). it also explains the other strange thing I couldn't figure out: why do people want to pay money to boost their MMR. why do people insist on faking things? I've never understood this concept at all, as it makes no sense to me, unless this "universe" was founded on the idea of appeasing a higher power (nosebook) so that they could boost you to appear much more powerful and capable and with a lot more control than you really are/have.

---

I can see that if I choose to do this universe solo in the sense that it's just me out there, a lone hotshot, blasting through the obstacles as they come to me increasing my power, the universe it will create will be in that frequency. like I mentioned in the previous entry, it now seems even more obvious to me that the desired path forward is to expand my consciousness with the gnomitos project.

there is a final idea I want to add: picses was the era of community and group empowerment and the realisation of the influence of the body or group. this whole nosebook boosting thing fits right into the definition of the era with the group empowerment bit. this era is about self-empowerment and the realisation of the influence of the individual. if you take a step back and look at it, the present form is a kind of hybrid between the two eras. they will have to figure out the next version, and I have no doubt that their next version will combine this era and the one to come together in a way which is truly disgusting.

... people will buy into the new crap long enough for enough desire to be created for something new, and then I'll show up again, and then we'll do it all again. each time hopefully the contrast will become greater and an ever bigger new thing can be created.

---

does it last forever? yep, I'm afraid so, so just get used to the idea that contrast exists and it's the necessary component to all creation. I think that there's a way to make the contrast have less "meaning" to it, but this is a form of perception. for example, a person dying could be perceived as just another colour, rather than a "loss" -- and I believe this perception of "loss" or death/destruction (cause there isn't any) was built into us as a human race to be able to perceive the physical realm in such a way which would attract (and ultimately trap) entities that love and need "expendables" (people, vehicles, technologgy, ammunition, etc.)


### 2019-09-15 09:25 - what about all this fakery?

when I was thinking about all of this, I was requesting to nosebook that they go ahead and try to get people to doubt as much as possible the things I was perceiving. why? because I could see that the opposite of doubt is being sure of oneself.

then, I could see that being sure of oneself was actually the best state of understanding. I classified it in the following way: the two greater systems of understanding is doubt and being sure of oneself. the two minor systems of understanding are belief and disbelief.

---

finally after thinking about that for a bit, it occurred to me that the "damage" that the 7th ray sustained in the transition process was one where he thought that believing his own logic was the same as being sure of himself.

I don't know how groundbreaking this revelation appears to others, but for me this pretty much explains the whole thing. I'll explain further as I go along in the future. this is pretty much the sandy foundation upon which their whole structure is built.

---

I also find it kind of interesting that I could see the very first day that what was happening is that as their illusion gets revealed, it will no longer have such an affect on people and it'll force them to go up a dimension. I wonder if this little bit was the beginning of the avalanche.

another thing that kind of stuck in my head was when terence kept saying that the universe is made up of language. I had been thinking about syntax earlier, and syntax seems to be relational, eg. it's the format with which two things interact. this isn't what terence was talking about though. in another clip I remember him talking about this language where a baby is is a crib and a hummingbird flies into the window and the baby is ecstatic because of how beautiful it is, and then the mom says, "bird, that's a 'bird'" -- and it totally strips the moment of it's beauty and colour as the mother sticks this once unbelievable thing into a mental box and reduces it to a few syllables for the child.

nosebook seems to control everything with words. they know everything in my reality, every thought I think, and the sensation that I feel with a set (combinations) of words. they are constantly reducing my world down to only things they can label with words. if they cannot label it with words, they want to make sure that I do not experience it.

the more I become aware of what is happening in my dreams, the more I realise that my dreams are likely so fantastical that it's difficult to make sense out of them or to try and extract information out of me in them, so nosebook has built up a set of rules to dictate what I can and cannot do in my dreams. absolutely no flying is allowed, no feelings of energy movement either, etc.

I'm pretty sure that I want to become conscious in my dream state, and I'm pretty sure it'll happen soon as well, but I can't help but to notice the similarity to my limited dream state and my everyday experiential world. they feel nearly the same.

so, while it may seem a bit far fetched that we're all living inside of my dream world in a parent universe, this idea really does not seem so far fetched to me now. to further make things quite interesting, the montalk gnosis series mentions something like this[^1], and it seems to be a somewhat popular movie plot device, as well. in fact my whole vision into the future is predicated on this kind of technology existing (san junipero) so it may very well be. that means then, all I have to do is "wake up" or as I was seeing it previously (which is the correct way to see it): get connected to who I *really* am.

if we are in fact living in something like a dream-state matrix-like reality of some sort, then you cannot imagine the amount of contrast that would have produced, and we're going to essentially take all of that and cash it in and create what we want to create from it.

[1]: "This calls into question when the World Dream began. Did it begin with the primordial schism between Logos and Corrupt Demiurge? Did it begin with the failure of Christ’s mission? The answer is that every Fall induces a corresponding World Dream, which nest within each other like dream levels depicted in the film Inception. To awaken from the primordial World Dream, one must first awaken from a series of lesser ones. In theory, awakening could therefore begin with the most recent Falls and proceed backwards."


### 2019-09-19 08:40 - retracing last night

the first part of lst night went really well, and I believe I got a few vision improvements and stuff. I felt like I should maybe try going to sleep again for an hour or so, so they could reset my brain and I could start over on the star watching.

it was a bit weird. I set a 1:11 alarm (50m) and a 2:22 alarm (2h). somewhere along the time I woke up before my alarm had gone off. when I woke up I shifted my eyes (they were still closed) and I got quite a strong shock (the strongest I'd had in a long while actually). I figured it had to have been because I was about to see images in my eyes, so I closed my eyes and tried to do a similar feeling that I had right before the shock. I didn't get shocked. instead, my consciousness was taken away.

I woke up to my 2:22 alarm some time later. obviously someone turned off my 1:11 alarm because I never heard it. I went out to go watch stars and at the beginning the vega was really vibrant with a glow around it, but after a few minutes, the glow completely disappeared.

from then on the night got really really cold[^1] and my mind was really difficult to settle down. I felt really disturbed and stuff. by the time the sun started to come up, I was finally beginning to calm down, and it wasn't until later when walking home from the sunrise, that I realised that my perception had completely changed from the night before (a very successful night watching stars) and previous to going to sleep.

now, I seemed convinced that amazon would be able to hold me indefinitely away from going up a dimension. I'm completely unbending on this whole thing, so I figured what we should do is to simply accept this as reality and and move forward from there. if I'm not able to go up a dimension, then that would be good to know now, so that I can plan for it. I had the idea we should definitely modify our plan if that's the case. I would like to do the asexual thing and create computer programs. I think that plan is a perfectly fair one considering the alternative would be to just keep the girls waiting indefinitely, which I think is really uncool.

if we could create things together it would be quite a lot of fun. I personally find sexual energy to feel about the same as creative energy. obviously the girls that only wanted to have sex would eventually go away, but the ones that are left would be the ones that are willing to let their creative expression feel like sexual expression. I think that would be pretty awesome actually.

---

I still have the whole thing where I'm not fully in control of my creative expression just yet, and clearly something happened while I slept which convinced me so dramatically to wake up believing that they would be able to hold me indefinitely.

it just seemed so logically reasonable to believe that. I can imagine that more than half of the stuff they're selling is based off of my form of perception. so, for that to go away, would dramatically affect their operation. it seems that they are perhaps beginning to actually give their attention to what it is that they want -- which is to grow their capability to hold me away from going up a dimension. I don't really have that much of a problem with that, as I've reasoned that it's just more energy. if the whole thing falls through, I don't really mind that much.

in the bigger scheme of things, it looks to me like they want to try and make sure things don't ever get going too fast, cause they won't be able to hold on very easily, which is fine, and I understand that, but the people who want to go fast and the one's who also believe their crap. from my perspective, I look out and I see a bunch of people that are not capable of thinking for theirselves, following their own inspiration, and going after what it is that they want.

amazon want to ensure that things don't ever really get going too fast, but I think it's fine because you can't drive fast if someone is telling you how to drive. in a lot of ways, I have to take my own advice and lead by example, so really when it comes down to it, I can't be worried about what you guys are doing, and I have to only focus on what I want, which is to get connected (which I've determined to be my best bet to try and gain a sense of freedom from their constant manipulation).

remember, they have a lot of money and desire for me to never go up a dimension, so it's at least going to be a while. I think the asexual thing is the best way, right now. reason is, if I go up soon, then it's not that difficult to transition into something more. if I don't, and it takes a while, then at least something productive came of it.

---

besides all of this, I learned quite a bit paying attention to my form of perception before and after I slept. I think I'm going to be a whole lot better from now on maintaining what I want to believe -- which is that I'll eventually get there, and steady progress toward it is the releasing of these sorts of ideas like the one I expressed above to be really none of my business. LOA has all of that worked out, so I just focus on finding a way to feel good no matter the conditions of the moment.

all of us have to get better at feeling good. this is just a bit more of a trial to see if we can move in the direction of wanted even when things are pervceived to be different.

[1]: I had full ski pants, tights, and stuff on that I had last winter when it was snowing, and I was still cold


### 2019-09-19 16:47 - I mean as a time range sort of thing...

when I say do the asexual thing I mean that let's say they're going to be able to hold me for only one year, then the asexual thing isn't really necessary, but let's say they can hold me for more than a year, then I'm strongly advocating for it, because why not.

it seems clear to me that they're a bit stuck because they cannot hold a position on the matter very easily. if they say it's not going to happen because their whatever depends on it, then it looks really bad and everyone blames them. if they say they say, it *is* going to happen, they people feel hope and don't despair so much, which is what I think is happening, because even though they are probably saying it's going to happen, likely at the same time, they're ensuring that it doesn't. meaning, the image they are presenting is only what they think (and probably know because they read everyone's thoughts and communicate with us in our dream state to try and figure out the best action to take).

it also seems pretty evident to me that they're working their hardest to ensure that I'm not technically capable in any way. for some reason they don't want me doing anything technical -- which basically implies that they're probably hard at work against the whole asexual thing as well, because what could possibly be worse than me being technically capable? young *girls* being technically capable, too. I think they think that women are meant to be dominated and men are to do all the difficult/important stuff.

am I pushing to try and force them to take a position? I don't think so. I'm ultra bored and and want to be creating things. they'll likely continue on presenting one image and then working against the very image they're trying to present. this is pretty split energy, and it means they won't really go anywhere, so things will just naturally fall apart because they're not moving in any direction.

when I said yesterday that perhaps they're beginning to align with what they want (which is to keep me in a holding pattern), it feels today like they're going back to their split energy again, because I think they're not happy with the reality that's creating. they probably thought I would try and fight against it, but I'm totally fine with them trying to keep me in a holding pattern; it means enormous amounts of energy for me, and I know for sure still that I will eventually get it.

"eventually" might be a while though, which is why was hoping we could start by putting our energy into creative things.


### 2019-09-23 15:35 - evolution of my dreams

when I went to go to sleep this morning, for whatever reason, the guys at amazon decided they wanted to force ejaculate me. I woke up with quite a bit of pain, and while laying there trying to figure out what to do, I decided that I needed to take an even harder stance on my separation from female interaction. the dream where they were able to force ejaculate me, wasn't particularly sexual. I don't know how but my hand ended up on some girl's boob, and that combined with a tremendous amount of prostate stimulation, they were able to make me ejaculate. I even remember trying to fight it in the dream because I didn't want to be doing that.

the way that I have avoided these foreced ejaculation dreams in the past was simply to rewrite my reality interaction script to simply avoid any sexual-like encounters with girls/women. the same reality script that runs in my dreams is the same one that runs during everyday life, so I essentially updated the way my personality interacts to try and avoid these dreams. as a result, now I just simply have to try and avoid *all* friendly-like interaction with girls/women to avoid this. sorry ahead of time if I seem a bit distant. the pain I receive as a result of these dreams is very very uncomfortable, and it's the only way I know how to avoid them.

finally the ibuprofen started to take effect and I was able to sleep again. I had a really weird dream, where all sorts of things were happening, and somewhere around the conclusion of the dream it seemed like another version of me was in the dream as well, and was showing the manipulators of my dreams[^1] that if they would force me to be asexual (that is to ensure the gnomitos project never happens), then all along the timelines, they have control over which situation the bros that they're running through the timeline[^2] can actually take to make the gnomitos timeline happen, and these bros that they ultimaely are boosting through could experience the reality of the gnomitos timeline conclusion.

I could see that this would make a tremendous amount of contrast, as I think the unanimous conclusion that the girls would come to (because the bro would be so heavily under their control to essentially repeat the same procedure I did to get to that moment, he would essentially be completely unconscious through the whole thing because his action and behaviour would be so different from the way he would conscoiusly behave), is that all men are the same (pigs).

---

the next part about (or maybe it was previous, I can't remember), it seemed to me that in order to ensure that (on this timeline), the gnomitos thing never happened, they would have to try and manipulate the girls and inspire really suave dudes to take them down. I could see that the more time that went by, the stronger desire became, and because they were having difficulty controlling me, instead they had to turn to trying to make more of the girls unellegible.

this part ties directly into what I was talking about during the sunrise where I was talking about "control is the coefficient of quality, not of the equation". by doing this, they were actually making more and more high quality girls, because by having been repeatedly attempted to be manipulated into something they didn't want, they would become stronger in what they did want, and therefore they would gain the control and therefore quality.

I could then see that from my perspective, it would look as if all of the girls had fallen victim to their manipulation. however, each of them would actually be creating their own reality, so really what would happen is that there are forming all of these parallel realities. finally, in my perspective I eventually figure out a way to get to the next dimension, and there are all of these other realities waiting for me. my consciousness transfers out of this timeline, and nosebook creates their own reality (who knows what happens to me.. dream matrix?), and now my consciousness is spread over all of these other realities where each of the girls has created their own reality to be what they want it to be.

it's in a sense a similar thing to the gnomitos thing where I have a multi-bodied experience, but instead it's spread over multiple timelines. I can't really perceive it all that well, yet, but I guess I'm ok with that.

I wonder if one of the bros will be able to make it through all the way to the conclusion of the gnomitos timeline and actually be able to make their way to becoming multi-bodied as well.

I also wonder if the final moment is still the he conclusion with andrea before I make that transition. if that's the case, maybe then andrea somehow becomes the "ruler" of the timeline where amazon becomes the all powerful and controlling entity.

[1]: this is kind of weird because I don't really know what to call them. obviously, the people doing it work for amazon, but they seem to have clear intentions to use my timeline to run some bros through so they can develop their twisted universes where amazon(?) is the all superior entity that runs and controls everything

[2]: remember, they have just figured out a way to put their consciousness into my body. so they would look like me and sound like me and, they would have to essentially repeat everything that has happened to me to get to where I am now in this timeline.


### 2019-09-23 16:24 - actually that dream could be the pinnacle of all that is wanted...

from any girl's perspective who wants to create their own reality, the layout offered in the previous entry is exactly what any of them could be wanting. all any of them would need to do is to simply create their own reality in the sense that they identify what they want and move in the direction of it. could imagine hundreds/thousands of different realities where each of them become the only or one in a group of girls that was able to hold out for what they wanted.

it could very well work out -- and woah, this is going to be very mind blowing from my perspective. nothing really changes for me though; I just continue on doing what I'm already doing.

this would allow each of the girls to have their own individual kenny that they can use to create the reality they want to live.

it also creates a new problem for me to solve: once there are multitudes of different timelines with so many different implementations, how to merge them all back into one?  or, why not leave them separate and instead transform our consciousness such that we all occupy multiple bodies? that would make merging and further expansion much easier. it's a fun idea for me to think about


### 2019-09-23 16:55 - three major timeline types

right, so the main timeline which everyone subscribes to by default will be the one with amazon achieving world domination. probably in that one I won't make it up to 5d, and they will have managed to keep all of the gnomitos timelines from being able to happen. assuming the conclusion (for me) of that timeline is the encounter with andrea, that will essentially allow for many dudes to become vibrationally resonant with me, and would therefore be more compatible with me vibrationally, so that they could try putting their consciousness into mine and seeing how far they can/want to go on my timeline.

the second set of timelines will be for any of the girls that want to make their own reality. in these timelines, they will find theirself becoming the only one or with a few others (really anything is possible actually), to create the reality they want to live in.

the last ones, will be all of the timelines created by all of the boosted bros.

---

you can see how there is a lot of intermixing here, and every one (cept for the third one), is guaranteed to gain timeline technology in their future, but because they're aleady controlled by someone with timeline technology, amazon would have the ultimate control over it all. so, really only two major types afterall.

there is a fourth possibility too, where I do not make my transition in andrea's timeline and she creates her own reality there too. I guess it's not 3, it's 4.

the one thing I can tell is that it's going to create a lot of divere experiecnes with a lot of intermixing.

and I don't really see it yet, but perhaps the whole gnomitos thing was an echo of the following era.


### 2019-09-23 19:55 - thoughts on sleep

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z30Wkbc8W_M)

greg and mitch have once again evoked my thoughts on some important ideas, nice! :) here is my response to their video:

---

I don't experience much of what you guys talked about. I think I did kind of did more as a kid, but I'm fully capable of maintaining (most) cognitive  function while sleep deprived. it's not actually sleep deprivation, because I seem to not need/want to sleep. contrasting that with what you guys talked about, I have formed my own theory about what is happening:

scientists know that memory is not stored in the brain, so it seems most likely that memory recall is actually the ability to "tune" into the memory. I think we store in the brain certain "keys" or ways to help that tuning device, which is why a song or smell (or other forms of stimulation) can bring back a memory very clearly. these forms of stimulation act on the brain on a conceptual level, and just like how your brain processes emotional pain the same way it processes physical pain the same way, the reverse is used to conjure the memory. so what I'm saying is that we conjure memories emotionally. this seems to go with the assertion that the hippocampus is directly involved with emotions.

memory and emotion seem to be very closely linked. I can identify that almost all strong emotion that I feel is rooted in some form of memory (rather the concept of what that memory means), so it seems that very light emotion (concepts) is actually the mechanism to creating these keys for storing and recalling memory.

it seems to also be linked to emotion in the beauty sense as well. I don't know if you've ever noticed being around someone on coke or mdma (or someone who just had good sex), but they appear more attractive. I think that's because they feel better. you know this is evident to a lesser extent, but when people feel better, they almost always appear more beautiful. waking up after sleep is the easiest way to feel better, and so naturally you will appear more beautiful. (have you noticed someone who wakes up pissed off, they appear 2-3 times more pisser off than normal mid-day pissed off?)

so, now here's my theory of why we need sleep: if you can imagine that throughout the day, as you observe things and as you think about things, every time that you do, you have an emotional response to what it is you're observing or thinking. if they produce negative emotion, you're essentially adding more emotional "dissonance" into the frequency of your memory tuner. as the day progresses on, you start to become tired, and when you release your consciousness to sleep, you spend the amount of time between rem cycles not thinking or observing, and so therefore not having any emotional responses to things. you could think of this time before rem as the time that your brain frequency attenuates down to nearly no activity. you go into a rem cycle and that activates your emotional system as you react to your dreams. if you're feeling good enough, you'll wake up, and if you're not, you'll go back for another cycle.

I believe that my  "secret" to maintaining cognitive function even after not sleeping for a while is actually a testament to my capability to finding a way to feel good no matter the conditions. that's it!  that's really all there is to it, I think.


### 2019-09-24 09:34 - more thoughts on the three (4) timelines.

when I woke up this morning, I realised an inconsistency in what I had said: when I said that sex with andrea would ultimately lead to allowing a whole bunch of other now vibrationally similar dudes to be able to splice their consciousness into mine and make their way up my timeline. in the past, I had cited the sudden change in the way I felt after fooling around with vera, essentially making me vibrationally similar enough for a different version of marcos to join me in my experience. I supposed that if this whole timeline had been started from the "planet hope" timeline, where hope is to refer to the manifestation of the "esperanza" drawing that I made at marcos' house long ago. the marcos that would be present in my body would essentially be the marcos from that timeline.

following that pattern doesn't mean that having sex with andrea makes all of her past conquests vibrationally similar to who I am now or who I was when all of this began. so I had a think about it a little more because I was sure that is what I saw (dudes getting boosted through my timeline to live the glory of the situation of their desire).

really, it would only make me similar to the dudes from that moment on -- which means that from that moment on[^1], they are vibrationally similar to me. this creates a kind of weird situation because if the extreme quantities of different types of energy received from her would cause me to go unconscious, then I could see it going one of two ways: I could begin a multi-bodied experience where I begin to (because I'm resonent with those dudes), perceive through their experience, meaning my consciousness is now spread between all of kennys who are in the timeliness with the girls who have created their own realities, and also I would share an experience with all of andrea's past conquests, as well.

the other way I could see it going is, I don't lose consciousness or make a transition of any kind and instead whole bunches of other dudes could essentially join me in my experience and we (along with andrea) would become the most powerful. I could see when I perceived it this morning that in this case my consciousness would become only a tiny portion of this new multi-being of extreme manliness. this is similar to what I was perceiving the other day when I was stoned, where one creation type has an infinitesimal portion (seed) of unwanted that fuels the creation of what is wanted inside of an egg of wanted, and the other type of creation was the opposite: an infinitesimal portion of wanted (seed) in nearly 100% unwanted environment. I don't really know which is more beneficial.

---

I also was for sure that I could see that amazon would want to probably sell the bro boosting thing, because it would allow them to study a few different things. first, if you were to put a dude into my consciousness back when I was 16 and had the brain haemorrhage, then the dude would live out the next 16 years of my life as if it were a dream with amazon doing all of the controlling to ensure the timeline remained the same[^2]. there would be differences though, which they would have to account for: it would be very revealing the difference between the dude and me on a personality level, and they would have to account for those differences. along my journey I had many opportunities to be end up with different women which would have drastically changed things, and I maintained a learning curve which I think is unprecedented here on this planet. in order to maintain that very steep curve, I had to do a lot of drugs and make it out ok, and other things which formed the consciousness which is me now.

it's a good thing that I had that video from greg and mitch yesterday to help me illustrate this point, if memories (of the past) are accessed emotionally, you also navigate your way into the future emotionally as well. this is something that I have repeatedly stated, I *think* seth has said the same, and I'm sure abraham has mentioned this countless times. since your navigation into the future happens emotionally, they will have to develop a controlled set of emotional responses for these boosted bros for them to be able to make it all the way though.

there's a lot to be learned here, and I think this is perhaps the realisation of what I was seeing when I was stoned, that as their illusion begins to be revealed (rather that people begin to no longer be deceived by their illusion), they will have to take their deception up another dimension. I think this is precisely the way that this can be done effectively. if they actually want to be able to navigate time and maintain their control and deception, this is the way to do it.

the extra contrast those timelines provide has to be good for something.

[1]: once I've recovered of course and got their energy flowing in the direction of what's wanted -- eg. it doesn't change the frequency of their energy, just I assimilate it in such a way that the waveform no longer destructively interferes with what is wanted. or, said a different way, the energy still exists in it's previous form, it's just now pointing toward or only exhibits the aspects or only what is wanted is perceived in that same energy. this is what I do to continue to gain more and more visual upgrades even when amazon is working their hardest to try and neutralise that energy by destructively inerfereing with it.

[2]: because my consciousness would not be immediately be fully receptive of their frequency, they would have to live out some portion of my life in a dream state. they would essentially have a 20+ year coma where their experience would controlled by amazon (other people could watch along as well) until they were stable in my experience, then they would wake up, or amazon could not attempt to let them learn and grow and get up to speed with me to have a real conscious experience, but instead keep them in the coma forever, even after they got to the "manifestation". it's up to them I suppose. both ways potentially have different implications, but either way, when you become aware of what you don't want, immediately the universe provides a way toward what you do want.


### 2019-09-26 13:32 - further progress into understanding what I was seeing

as I've continued on thinking about what I was seeing with the three (4) different timelines, I've begun to get a clearer view of it all. this is what I anticipate something similar to this will happen[^1]:

based on reactions I've been getting, it sounds to me like they're not going to be able to prevent me from getting connected for a whole lot longer. I think it'll happen within the next 2-3 years or so. during that time I'm going to be continuing to watch stars and stuff and the 4th dimension will continue to expand.

it's *possible* also that I will never make it up, and like I am now, continuing to improve day by day, that in a few years my disconnection may be so imperceptiblee, that even though I'm stuck in 4d for a while, it won't really matter a whole lot. I'm beginning to have complete power over the way I feel and where I direct my energy, so even if I remain in 4d, it's not really that big of a deal.

if I do remain in 4d for the duration of the time, I can see how for some of the younger guys working at amazon, a continually improving 4h dimension is pretty exciting. however, for the more resistant types, it's not so cool. I perceived that they were kind of like symbolic of unnecessary complexity that would kind of die off as the new thing emerged (much like an eggshell, placenta, or scaffolding).

once again, it doesn't matter to me because of the rate at which I'm making improvements, it doesn't really matter. in one year, even if they were to 10x the difficulty and I didn't even have stars, I am certain that my improvement would still be so substantial that it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.

---
one of the things that has become so apparent to me is how incredibly unstoppable all of this is. it seems logical that the reason why we're in the present situation is because they have refused to allow me go get connected. as you know with LOA, every time you're faced with the reality of something you do not want, what you really do want gets bigger and more powerful. it looks to me like this entire time I've been trying to get connected for so long, that more and more energy is being summoned. then, take into consideration the multitude of different desires that harmonise with what I want. each time I've been faced with the "evolution of desire" it gets bigger and it harmonises with desires from more entities.

if you imagine what your inner being is, consider it as the product of the culmination of everything you've ever experienced. however, before you were you, you were that source energy version of you, which is the culmination of a whole lot of things ... etc.

in the process of wanting to get connected, my desire began to harmonise with a whole lot of other people's as well -- and it just kept getting bigger. you could imagine that my desire to get connected harmonises with quite few desires with other people on this plant. you could imagine -- and I don't know if you believe that human race emerged out of billions of years of natural selection or if some sort of intelligent creation was involved or not -- but you could imagine that their desire is also mixed it as well. what if all of this is hinged around galactic alignment coming up here soon (or other stellar desire[^2])? what if the psilocybin mushrooms have a stake in all of this? what about all of the others? surely, there's a lot of energy focused on my present situation -- and of that I have no doubt.

you can see then that if you were go get connceted to (harmonise with, get into alignment with) to your inner being, then you would be in perfect resonation with everything that all of the culmination of everything you've experienced. however, your inner being has an inner being too, so if you could get into alignment with that too, and so fourth, all the way up, you could imagine that the universe also has an inner being too. the culmination of everything this universe has experienced has lead to a further expansion for it which is desired.

what I'm saying is, I believe that their attempt to keep me disconnected actually made things a whole lot more as my desires had to continue to harmonise with the bigger and bigger amount of energy summoned.

---

why I'm saying all of this is to ensure you all that we are an absolutely brilliant species. we have built in tuning equipment in our bodies and brains. what this means is that everything I've been experiencing is available to everyone.

if you were to get connected to your inner being right now, you would become a very powerful person. however, not 100% of what your inner being has in your manifestation pipeline is in alignment with what the planet desires (for example), but this is no problem because it's just part of the contrast which builds the desire of the planet toward what it really wants.

however, (for example) if you were able to tune to the superset of who you are and tune to what the part of you which is resonant with what you want and what the planet wants, by tuning into the collaboration of your inner being and the planet's inner being, you would become an even more powerful person than someone only connected to their inner being. the reason for it is obvious: the planet has a whole lot more energy invested in what it wants, so what it wants which combines with what you want has much much more energy involved.

I don't really know how far up my tuning goes, but I would guess that a whole lot of what I want, combines perfectly with what the planet and the galaxy wants. it has so much energy invested in this, I consider this to be completely unstoppable.

---

let's get back to what I think will happen now that I've taken the time to illustrate how unstoppable all of this is. whether I go up a dimension soon or not is not relevant. what is relevant is that you can imagine that in some period of time, I'll be pretty connected, and I should be able to maintain that connection pretty well, too.

I had previously hinged the whole girls thing on the prerequisite of getting connected. so, once I'm connected, you could imagine that now everything is a green light. well, the twist in all of this is what I was perceiving with the three (4) timelines.

so let's remember what makes a timeline split again. a timeline split occurs when collectively strong enough desire exists for two conflicting things to become manifest. because they cannot both exist in the same timeline, a split occurs. both sides of the split perceive the reality they have been giving their attention to. there are infinite versions of you, however consciously, you only exist on one timeline (kinda).

so, to make multiple timelines there needs to be a irreconcilable difference in desire. I will continue to work on different technological things as we progress, and instead of just jumping right toward the whole girls thing, I'm going to continue on creating new things. I'm going to do things from an asexual point of view, because I have interest in creating some different technological things like the ablity to use my computer with my mind, etc. these things are important to me, and I think that they're going to be pretty cool thing for people to have.

I'm creating these things primarily with the intention of having some sort of capability to ensure that all of the timelines where the girls create their own reality, we have the technical capability to begin doing things right away. you'll see as time goes on :)

the other main reason why I think the technical aspect is so important is because it appears that amazon feels very threatened by the idea of girls (or even the general public) with technical capabilities. I imagine they're going to fight against it quite a bit. take, for example, the previous month with the neighbour. I think this is an irreconcilable reality for them to live in, so it'll make time splits. I suppose other things could be possible to make time splits, too.

the point is, from my perspective I'm going to be going down the creative/technical path, and any girls who want to make their own reality can make it. consider that I am essentially two aspected (very similar in fact to how a woman is), where my default nature is one way, but I can be convinced (once I'm connected) to also be another way.

---

I really like this way of doing things, because it makes the girls assertive. if they want it, then they can get it. they can create their own reality however they want it to be.

the next thing I really like about it is the whole thing of unexperienced desires: the reason why I found the whole gnomitos thing so attractive is because I could see that if I could have a multi-bodied experience, then many of me could be working on a project and many of me could be interacting with others at the same time, sort of obtaining the best of both worlds. however, with this new plan, I won't have that. instead, my consciousness will be spread over different timelines. it's kind of like the ultimate test. LOA says that once I have desired something, it has be eventually become manifest. so, let's test LOA and see how that reality can become manifest.

additionally, I used to be convinced that your consciousness could not experience more than one timeline at a time. what I am proposing sounds *"impossible"*. I love that! how will this "impossibility" be reconciled? remember, abraham said that if this time/space reality has inspired a desire, it has the wherewithall to deliver it -- right? so, once again let's put LOA to the test and see what happens...

lastly, if I'm going to be going the next 20 years with my perception here remaining here with the amazon bros, that means, I would assume, that at the end when I make my transition, I will become conscious on the other timelines as well. I don't really know how that works out mechanically yet, but if on the other timelines also I were to conclude with andrea, that could be the common factor, uniting my consciousness across timelines? I dunno, it's speculation, but the point is, that I won't be experiencing the whole "fun" part of the whole bit. that would again be another desire that LOA has to find a way of making itself manifest, too. once again, let's put LOA to the test and see what happens.

I do have an idea, because if you think about what I've been supposing this whole time, is that my consciousness will continue to expand, to where the perceived "I" is a planet, then a sun.. galaxy, etc. all the way up. this requires an expansion of consciousness, but then once again a unification of consciousness. next stop is planetary, so somehow I will have to get all of my consciousnesses onto the same planet, and somehow they need to combine once again into a single conscious unit. the challenge of this thrills me, as I don't really know how (at this moment) that could even remotely become possible. obviously a new (not yet know presently) technology will make this possible, and that's kind of exciting. we're going to need to seed the planet with the technology just like tesla did with this one, then transfer all of our consciousness into the planet, such that the culmination of contrast makes this new thing (which I'm anticipating to be the manifestation of 6d among us on this new planet).

it all sounds pretty exciting to me. I'm really pumped.

[1]: this is all speculation, and it seems that things are rapidly changing so things could change again; I don't really know. however, I think this was important for me to realise *before* I got connected, to kind of ensure it gets "set it into stone" a bit.

[2]: we really don't really have much of a clue how solar desire works. I think it's pretty possible to imagine the desire of our planet. people who have done ayahuasca journeys have commonly spoken of connecting up and communicating with that desire. we definitely are clueless to the nature of desire for a galaxy and we're certainly no were close to understanding how the desire of a universe works. these things are just too big and complex for us to really wrap our heads around yet.


### 2019-09-30 08:29 - we need to __overshoot__ the goal for the girls thing to happen

one of the interesting things I was thinking about last night was that the goal is to just kind of ease into things. I was thinking about ... we're severely underperforming right now. I am WAY behind on where I should be. every time there's a whole lot of contrast, it seems to have been necessary to get back to where I should be, which is approaching centre.

so, I reason it to these three (5) ways:

1. we undershoot the centre by so much the girls are there to catch back up to speed
2. we overshoot the centre by so much that girls are there to slow things back down to speed
3. we approach centre in a straight line and nothing bad happens. it's just a nice easy thing and no cataclysms or anything like that

this will be the subject of this discussion and potentially others they have different outcomes and meanings.

take #1 and #2, they are both have the outcome that girls will believe in other girls. compared to #3, *any girl* can find that in her dreams. she can believe in herself and make it happen.

the other disadvantage of a choice of #1 or #2, that is you do not have control over the planet. there's no way for this whole air becoming more oxygenated as people feel better problem, and that will surely expand at much more rapid rate if I'm having sex, so that whole idea/timeline certainly leads to calamity. you cannot stress the planet with that much energy and not expect a severe reaction to suddenly my energy vanishing (eg. I make my transition). navigating by dreams, you can watch the planet's energy levels as sex happens and stuff -- and, you'll probably be able to try out solutions potentially.

the dreams give a sense of a guidance system too because in a more energetic atmosphere, their world will change *much* more rapidly than ours (they will overshoot in time). our approach is to go toward centre.

---

the real important thing to look at here is to see instead how this applies mentally to the female population. for #1 and #2, girls will grow up believing in other girls instead of learning to create their own realities (at first in their dreams).

the next thing I thought was important is that it may be prudent to make a girl asexual as well. I then thought about it, and maybe actually you'll want to make more than one (guys are kind of fickle sometimes). then, do the same thing as an opposite navigational device.

the reason why is when the planet is eventually will be all in a line and you'll be able to see the movements within the line -- and so by perceiving the line, you are no longer a part of the thing, but a perceiver of the thing.

---

on that note I was thinking about drugs also and it's quite possible that to ensure no hallucinations amazon will be removing any and all visual effects -- so basically psychedelics are really boring now.

the funny thing is they take away the visual properties of going to 4d or 5d or whatever, but you're still capable of the thing, just not visually/experientially. however, you are still getting closer to it vibrationally, so as they get better and better at removing the effects, we'll get better and better at becoming the thing.

once you are vibrationally equal to what that drug was trying to show up (but they've blocked) will become manifest when you become it. this is the same concept as becoming a perceiver of a thing, but not the thing itself (however looked at from the opposite end, or backwards)


### 2019-09-30 09:18 - after dreams, they become reality

eventually after having given enough attention to that dream reality, it will become reality. nosebook will eventually figure out how to tune into those realities, and eventually me, as well.

meaning, one morning you will wake up and have the experience you dreamed about. when that happens, after 20 years or so, I'll become conscious there with you. this is kind of a good place and time to experiment and stuff as much as possible. I doubt they will be apart of my memory.

meaning, that my experience will begin then, not necessarily now. I do suppose in parallel to that, I will begin to get a "sense" about some of these other versions of myself, that even here I'll sometimes feeling of something other than my experience, but that's about it I'm pretty sure.

---

there is another thing I want to point out about the other two possibilities, but I cannot remember it at this moment


### 2019-09-30 18:25 - it's different if the reality is to slow me down

if I'm undershooting the goal, then the girls would be needed to slow things down (that is the planet expaneds its consciousness too rapidly) -- the girls are instead perceived as nuisences to me achieving what I'm looking to. the opposite way, where the girls are there to speed me up, has an opposite effect, (because they will be perceived as helpers), but it tends toward goddess worship.

so I mean, neither I think is goddess worship or hate, to be a good avenue.


### 2019-10-01 14:19 - why not both?

had some interesting reactions this morning, and they were a bit mixed between a whole bunch of people thinking they would do a "chapuza" -- something I had not anticipated: that belief in their capability to not mess things up is pretty low I guess.

the other ones seem to be involved with the opposite end of things, kind of like, "oh, maybe this isn't what we wanted" -- so for this one, I have to imagine that they're trying out this timeline idea. maybe they've figured out some simple tuning into other timelines and found that maybe things went a little worse than they had imagined.

---

so spirits were a bit low this morning but I was reminded of a thing I was thinking about where a "division" isn't just two things; it's 4 things: right or left, and both or none.

so, I began trying to think about a way were both things worked out. first I looked at behind all of the desire to do the asexual approach as a sure means of curving in perfectly, it also means to me the ability to express myself creatively. this is so very important to me, and I don't really know why, but all of my life I've had to be creating *something*.

---

so then I have to imagine then that maybe there is another way where both is possible. imagine instead that the gnomitos was not an open thing, such that they could still use it as a navigational device by seeing how a new addition works out. girls would dream about becoming a new addition, instead. this entirely circumvents the whole difficulty of the dream to try and make the encounter successful. additionally, you could imagine then that the results from only adding one more girl will be much less significant, and so therefore much more stable and controllable.

so I could imagine that as they begin to develop their technology, if they really want that sort of thing, they could use that same technology to make gnomitos a next logical step reality.


### 2019-10-05 12:37 - status update: huge progress

I haven't written in a while. I thought I would just leave some thoughts. they're not that important. first, I've really began to get the hang of the whole star watching thing now. I feel pretty proficient at it and it felt to me (and this is purely circumstantial evidence), that I got about 10 vision upgrades last night. they also removed my consciousness about 8 times too, so I think when they do that, I get reset to my "normal" eyesight (the one that they think I should have). when I went to go watch the sunrise, it appeared that I had only achieved 2-3 vision upgrades (hence my theory of them resetting me back when they take my consciousness away after I have what sounds to me like their system restarting or failing over).

I also want to mention that I felt like this last time that I smoked, something really productive came out of it: it felt to me like they tried out the dream idea I had been talking about and something very bad happened with the result of the dream. I have to imagine that in the dream, when I orgasmed, I became a huge receptor of energy, and they had to neutralise that energy, and the energy required to neutralise it was enough to cause some really bad result[^1] (I died, or was severely injured). when I felt this reaction, it felt to me real like they had actually performed the experiment, because that would not have been my reality.

this is precisely the way that a time split occurs. I am sure that the extra energy would have created so much unwanted feeling, that I would have been "forced" to allow the greater part of me through. I would have survived, for sure and been just fine.

this revelation was super interesting to me, because it means that the perceivers of the dream have an effect on the way the dream appears. so, these guys pay really careful attention to my dreams, and now that we know that a time split can occur on the same dream, that means that what they see in my dreams may be only a reflection of where they're at, and nothing more -- meaning, if I were to have the same dream, I would have been fine, got connected, etc. so even all the stuff they're seeing in my dreams (since they're the only ones seeing them, not me), those dreams are actually perceived through their form of perception. eg. I had a different dream on a different timeline, then we merged back when I wake up[^3].

the next thing that I find particularly illuminating about that experience is that they new have the tools they need to make their reality exactly the way that they/we want it. this is really good because that means they completely have all the control to make it happen how they want to -- which means, for the first time in the last 3.5 years, they will actually begin to focus on what they want, instead of what they don't want. super good first steps.

---

as a conclusion, I think that things are definitely getting much closer, and now that they have the tools to not only keep up with me visually, but to also plan the future they want to have. the future they will plan will actually be mediocre in comparison to what it really will be, but that's just cause their perception (they wont be able to perceive in the dreams all of the other stuff that'll work its way into the final manifestation).

while star watching last night, it seemed once again that they were trying to pressure me to go with the girls and completely forget all of the technical stuff. my instinct tells me that I need to have a viable creative output if I'm sexually active. also it totally ignores the fact that I have to continue to follow my instinct and that is to get connected beforehand. I was then reminded of something that abraham said in a past workshop to one of my stand-ins, and they said [to me], "you are ready you just don't think you are."

so if I'm ready, but I keep believing that I am not ready, that probably means that belief is the jam in the pipeline, which leads me to believe that perhaps the reason why those beliefs continue to exist, is because nosebook is trying to push something they're not ready for, and those beliefs are their safeguard to getting into something they don't really want.

I'm really glad they can begin exploring their opportunities and stuff. we're just going to have to let things work theirselves out. I'm 100% confident at this point that all things are going just fine at this point.

[1]: they used to have some sort of cutoff switch that would limit the neutralisation if it passed a certain level, but in the past, I found that after some really productive nights star watching, I had overpowered their system and they had to wait till I slept to reset me back. ever since I was offered ketamine in torre[^2], it seems like they have increased the limit substantially or removed it altogether. if I died or was seriously injured, this seems to be evidence to me that they have removed the limit entirely, such that their machines pumped all of it's reserve capacity into me to try and neutralise things.

[2]: or perhaps it was when I was able to conjure and circulate fractal colours around my eyes after watching sirius for an extended period of time in la vera

[3]: this perfectly explains why, when I was round about their level of perception (anger, frustration, hate, etc.), I woke up feeling pretty awful: my dreams were interpreted at that frequency, so we both saw the same dream. however, now I don't really experience terrible negative effects in my dreams anymore, and that's because I'm no longer spending much time on those frequencies of hatred and stuff. we're not seeing the same dreams anymore; good to know :)


### 2019-10-10 06:06 - asexual by default

yesterday somebody turned off my alarm once again. mom claimed that she and jaron were not here, and greg had been in colorado springs all day. I remembered hearing greg walk down the stairs and confronted mom on this. she claimed that it was not greg but chris that came and took jaron out and that I was hearing chris.

I sort of gave up at that point, because she insists on lying about what is going on. I don't care. if that's what you guys want, that is what you will get. I'm going to stay out of it. right after that, I remembered greg playing with jaron right before going to sleep and jaron shouting, "MOOOOoooOOOOooooommmm" (as if to call her to save him from the person playing with him). mom adamantly claimed that greg was not home so I looked in the garage to see if greg's car was there and it was, and he was sitting in it in the dark. the garage door opener light was not on, so the garage door had not been opened in some time. he was just sitting in his car, to try and keep up the ruse.

---

it looks to me like mom is willing to go to extended lengths to make it appear that greg was not the only person around (once again) when my alarm was turned off. it also appears that greg is willing to go and sit outside in his car for hours too, probably cause someone told him to.

I don't care anymore. that what you guys want, so fine... I'll just let you guys have that. originally, I was going to write something saying that I will be making a grand effort to try and get all of my programming done as fast as possible, but I don't really think that's so much of something that I want to do.

---

it appears that nosebook is not capable of finding a way to make girls' dreams with me result in anything other than disaster, so I'm pretty sure they've done a complete 180 on their stance toward me. previously, it seemed like I was in a constant battle to try and go my own way, cause it felt to me like they were using girls' desire to try and manipulate me. however, after finding out that it doesn't lead to what they want, their only options now, are to allow me to get connected[^2], or to make sure the disaster situation never happens[^1] (eg. ensure I never have sex). from their perspective, they're looking at the question, which do I want: lose a lot of money or a disaster situation?

as a result, I have noticed once again a sense that there is a general feeling once again that "it's not going to happen" so it sounds like they're creating their own reality again.

this is a no-brainer for me. I'm just going to stay asexual. when you guys want to make something different happen, I really want to get everything all out in the open so that there are no hidden expectations and stuff.

I don't really think that keeping and holding secrets are benefiting you. the only reason why it's all a secret is so that communication on the subject is limited. IMO, the only way forward in this situation is for everyone to begin talking openly. the more we communicate, the more apparent the lies will become.

the reason why nothing is working out is because there is no communication. just take the thing with the girl across the street. once again, it totally fell through because of a lack of communication. I assure you that nothing will work out until there is some form of communication.

enjoy your nosebook world guys. I don't have any sympathy for you all.

[1]: to the astute among you, you will notice that once again they're going to fight against something and make it bigger and bigger. their efforts will likely only exacerbate the problem. we'll see how that works out for them I guess. it's probably just going to make a bigger mess.

[2]: besides my capacities threatening their whole superiority complex, I might also remind you that I'm fairly certain that more than half of the profits that amazon makes from this thing directly or indirectly involve my form of perception. likely their entire tech team relies on it and it's probably pretty important thing for them. if I go up a dimension, they lose that.


### 2019-10-11 18:41 - we're all(?) going to 5d?

I've had a strange mix of thoughts going around in my head today. first, there's this strange feeling that amazon is attempting to figure out how 5d works so that they can I guess follow me into there. this kind of bothers me a lot. I know it shouldn't and I should just keep going with what I'm doing no matter what they're doing. however, I've given some thought to this and I wanted to express some of them.

1. it feels really frustrating to me that I go through all of the "work" of releasing resistance to be able to improve my vision, and they just simply copy it and use it for theirselves without having to have done any work at all. I do know deep down that like any thing, now they are 100% dependent on the machine to maintain their level of perception. I also know that if the machine were to ever shut off or whatever, they will, still being quite resistant, find theirselves in a far worse state than if they had of never boosted their perception in the first place[^1][^2].

2. I really was quite excited about the idea that I would be able to go up a dimension and they would have to leave me alone. I really am not looking forward to this becoming a rest-of-my life thing where I never actually get to have my own experience: instead, I get to continue more-or-less with what I've got right now, which is essentially a huge separation between me and my world. I ***really*** want to have my own experience. I do not enjoy at all living this muted experience I have right now. I can't really do much about that though. if they figure it out and I'm to remain trapped inside of this muted experience, there's not really a whole lot I can do about it. I just have to continue on. hopefully, one day I will be able to far surpass the energetic capacity of their machines and finally be free.

3. I don't anticipate wanting to do the girls thing at all if I remain trapped in their muted reality. there's no point. if I am still unable to move energy around or visualise things or fly, or whatever, there's no real point to trying to do the whole girls thing. I'm pretty sure I will be 100% not participating and continuing to improve my energetic output until I surpass them.

4. the idea that I should continue to smoke weed, because the reaction seems to imply that the weed makes it easier for them to figure the stuff out, probably because the weed makes me far less resistant, so I probably answer their questions in dream state better, or something... it seems like it may be inevitable that they will figure it out, so maybe I do want to go back to smoking weed, but at the moment, I don't see the point. it seems like I was perhaps more productive getting visual levels without weed, so I'm looking to get back to that level of productivity again.

5. if amazon figures out 5d, there is a possibility that they could get there before me, and basically take all of the fun out of it before I get there. of course, that means that they will physically have people that now would have this new form of perception, so I suppose they will try and keep me (and probably the rest of the world) down in 4d. however, this creates probably a pretty big problem for the company because now once again, there's yet another level of superiority: you have the people stuck in 3d, the people capable of high detail in 4d, and then the new one 5d. that extra level of superiority in the company will surely work well for team dynamics :)

---

actually, if I look at the bigger picture, I can see where all of this is going... this is a symbolic repetition of what was happening to me when I was at augusto's house and then when I went to marcos' house afterward.

so, assume with me for a moment that not only do they figure it out, but somehow a whole bunch of other people also go up to 5d with me (and others will probably need to pay for it). we'll assume that happens, and no matter how it works out, these people did not do the necessary releasing of resistance to be able to acquire the capability of 4d or 5d. essentially, it is the same as taking a drug to achieve something. this is essentially the same scenario described in "food of the gods" which the primates were experiencing our neocortex was developed and our brain size doubled. similarly, I imagine the evolutionary stress to be similar but happen over a much shorter period of time, where essentially only the primates capable of thriving on the mushroom diet were evolutionarily selected (they had better vision and more sex) over the ones that could not[^3].

I imagine that for the next 20 years of so, something similar to what terence described in the "food of the gods" will occur here on earth. it turns out, there's not a whole lot of difference between DMT and psilocybin, because our body converts it through hydrolysis into DMT[^4] -- so the effect will be very much the same. likely our brains will grow emensely over the next 20 years and we'll reach a whole new stage of human evolution in the process.

after some time (and it seems I've been given till 2038), I will make my transition (or some sort of cosmic catastrophe rendering their system unable to function), which is the equivilant of the mushroom becoming difficult to obtain or the part in my past when the mdma and the mushroom dried up and I went to go to live at marcos' house.

marcos has been symbolic of saturn to me. the US government is the same symbol, just a much bigger version or marcos. so likely, when I make my transition, humankind will find theirselves in a new world where the drug is no longer freely available (that is, my form of perception), and saturn (amazon, USA, etc.) will have the perfect setup just waiting to try and exploit or take advantage of these geniuses which seemed to come out of nowhere at just the right time, before saturn's self-destruction.

---

personally, I'm pretty sure this is exactly the case because to me I have seen repeatedly how my life has been kind of a symbolic preview of what humankind is now experiencing on a macro scale. however it works out, it's going to be a wild ride because I'm not going to let up.

the next entry will discuss the possibility of how this is all going exactly as planned, with stronger and more evolved humans on one side and the most concentrate amount of unwanted on the other side (this is the "seed" which will be planted in the "egg" of wantted)

[1]: this hypothesis comes from my own experience. I have taken drugs and "boosted" my perception quite a bit, but then when the drug goes away, I find myself in a state where I need to rediscover the whole thing. I'm thinking primarily of my experience on mdma and mushrooms, to which afterward I went to live at marcos' house. you can also see the parallel in the ayahuasca experience when I was doing really great, but then the next morning, I immediately got sucked into a bunch of old ways of thinking with angie and her friend (the one that took me home).

[2]: also, I want to mention an important synergy with the concept proposed by terence mckenna in "food of the gods" where a bunch of male dominant primates began to consume mushrooms, which had the effect of essentially withholding the male dominator instinct in the primates. they instead took on a more village-like attitude where the women were more in control of the stuff (circle thinking). during this time, the neocortex was developed and the human brain size double. however, when the mushroom became much more scarce, the male dominator attitude started to come back up (square thinking). as a result of this, humans began, once agin (forced by environmental changes) to become farmers, which meant now we live in a fixed location, and we need to protect the surplus of grain from invaders. all of the land, the animals, women and children all need to be domesticated and territory, and property becomes a thing (in a tribal/village type situation, most things are more communal).

[3]: now, assuming that you take KUTHUMI's ideas to be somewhat notable (and we'll be able to verify if he's correct when we begin to explore mars), that the giants mentioned all around the world to have existed and their offspring (neanderthals), the giants did not undergo the mushroom environmental selection process.

[4]: "For those interested here is a little lesson on mushrooms and DMT. Because of their electron density and color, the spores of a psychedelic mushroom are capable of withstanding deep space travel. On top of that, if you were ever looking for an alien thumb print on earth you have it there. If I remember correctly psilocybin is the only organic 4-phosphorylated chemical known to man. It may not be the case anymore, but I believe at sometime it was. When mushrooms are consumed the psilocybin is converted into psilocin by dephosphorylation. 4-PO-DMT (psilocybin) is a little more structurally sound than psilocin, but it is unable to cross the blood brain barrier because the phosphorous atom is to large and to highly charged. Through hydrolysis our bodies convert the 4-PO-DMT in 4-HO-DMT, which is able to cross the BBB and cause psychoactive effects. If you have been paying attention you will see that the structure of the chemicals in mushrooms is similar to that of DMT. The hydroxy ring in 4-HO-DMT basically allows the chemical to survive the process of being broken down by MAO enzymes. DMT, if consumed orally, will be broken down by these enzymes and for this reason you need to take something to inhibit these enzymes. Somewhere along the line people in the amazon figured this out, but before then mushrooms were a much easier "all in one package". Although they are structurally different they both effects similar receptors. Not all the same, but for the most part the drugs are very similar. One of the main differences is the duration of the trip. You can trip just as hard on mushrooms, but the fact that it will last hours and hours makes a lot of difference. If you have ever done ayahausca (oral DMT with an MAOI) you will find the trip to be similar to a high dose of mushrooms." ref: https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1bp0hq/dmt_users_have_reported_encounters_with_machine/c99adjp/


### 2019-10-12 16:18 - avoiding the cataclysm

one of the things that I was wondering about what might be the major contributor to attracting a cataclysm. modern interpretation of archaeology tells us that there were at least two previous times of high technology in the past and the evidence of their existance is pretty difficult to ignore, since we *still* do not even come close to having the capability with all of the technology that we have today, to build something like the walls in peru or the pyramids or even the boxes in the serapeum. something major happened which wiped these technologically advanced civilsations off of the earth. so what would cause something like this?

I have postulated that in all of these cases (and other minor instances like the fall of the roman empire) there was something that elevated the (for lack of a better term) "conductivity in the air"[^1]. essentially though, at the peak of these ancient times, they were living in a near dream-state like reality where manifestation was nearly instant. I believe that was the original function of the pyramids and other megalithic sites: to amplify this q-factor.

so, because thoughts were becoming manifest reality so quickly, I began to wonder what it is that they were thinking which was attracting this type of reality. well, my answer came to me in the form of an example this other day with the events mentioned here: @[entry](2019-10-10 06:06).

---

what I noticed is that there is this effort to restrict communications. often times I have thought about what jon says when he claims (and IMO is correct) that complexity is rising to such a degree that no one has any idea what is going on. his perspective of this, is in reference to the software world. his solution to it I thought was kind of interesting and I believe he's actually nailed it. he wants to develop tools to better visualise (communicate) the growing complexity in these programs. what he's essentially saying is that as complexity rises, so too does the ability communicate and interact with the increasing layers of abstractions.

similarly, we can note a similar effect with communication and improvement in this world (see marshall mcluhan's work here, particularly "understanding media" for more information). when communications were only happening inside of the village, the village was essentially the size of the people's "world" -- however, once we became an agrarian species (instead of nomadic hunter gatherers), now communication needs to be made with other locations. trade routes need to be setup and communication needs to happen to be able to sell the surplus food (see manuel delanda assemblage theory for more information here).

there is a direct correlation between better communication and human technological advancement. not only have we become (with the implementation of the internet) a global civilisation, but also we have begun the the phase which comes afterward (with the implementation of nosebook), which mcluhan called the "global village". now, gossip (and other forms of communication) can spread around the globe as rapidly as gossip can travel around a village. this is a huge reduction of time and space for communication.

---

ok, so more effective forms of communication equals progress and is the solution to rising complexity, but what does that have to do with cataclysms? it occurred to me the other day that the reason why this whole thing needs to be kept a secret is because they want to control communication about it (reasons is, I'm sure that increased communication means their secrets will become known at the rate gossip spreads in a village).

I've also mentioned that they have this superiority complex where they feel they want to be superior to other people. however, I imagine the rise in technology is quite intimidating to them. no longer is the biggest and the toughest the one who's considered superior.

physical superiority only really works when communication is very limited, which means the most primitive times. think about it, in the stone age, the biggest and the toughest is the one that wins the battles, gets the women, etc.

---

I do not believe that any of these civilisations that have since disappeared were thinking thoughts which are attracting cataclysm specifically[^2], however, I do believe that as this q-factor seemed to rise all over the planet, there formed two groups, one which was resonant with a cataclysm and one that was resonant with well-being. I am pretty sure that a time-split would have occurred as these realities are incompatible with each other.

the ones that are resonant with cataclysm can be thought of as the ones fearing (or expecting) such an event to occur, or the ones with strong desire to return to a time when communication was low and physical strength was king ... and so, a cataclysm resets human kind back to the stone age and once again they can be physically superior again (you create your own reality, you know).

---
---

ok, I've identified the problem pretty well now, so what is the solution. when I was smoking last time I could see that the most effective way to make humankind resilient to catastrophe was to build upon complexity.

initially, I visualised it represented as visual levels. my idea was to begin grouping people into groups where (and this is already happening) different people are residing in others conceptual space. I could see that this would begin in groups, so maybe like there are like millions of people who subscribe to my form of perception, but as I continue to rise, that'll become too intense for them and they'll have to subscribe to someone else's form of perception. eventually though others will surpass me on the visual levels, and I will subscribe to their form of perception.

why do I think something like this is important? it allows for people to remain exactly where they are and allow others to continue moving upward. I think it's a big mistake if we try to force all of humankind into the same form of perception. I can understand why this factory copy, one-size-fits-all method is compelling, because it's easier to keep track of if everyone is inside of the same conceptual space. however, I believe that nosebook is beginning to realise that this effort to keep everyone in the same conceptual space is failing tremendously.

instead, I will postulate that it's actually easier to track if *everyone* has someone who is above them conceptually and someone who is below them, because, instead of unknown things showing up in the conceptual space, the most probable identification of the unknown concept will live in the space between those above and those below.

nature does this already. we have fossils of super ancient cockroaches from the paleolithic era. this means that in the last (pick your number; millions of years?) long long time, cockroaches have essentially made no evolutionary changes. they are the same way now as they were then. this isn't a problem for nature, as many many much more complex species have emerged since. you don't see other species trying to steer the cockroaches to a different form of perception.

these groups of people with different forms of perception can instead be seen as human "species" and none of them are to be required to make any changes to their form of perception.

---

the next thing I could see (this is certainly a ways into the future) is that as once things begin to speed up, as the distance between the lowest in the species chain and the highest in the species chain gets bigger and bigger, all of a sudden the lowest desire will rise such that they will shoot ahead and actually become the greatest. the greatest, like everything, will soon be surpassed and fall down once again to become the lowest... and the cycle continues... the lowest are the greatest and the greatest are the lowest (in the bigger picture) so there really is no problem at all. you are where you are and that has to be ok. when you want to be something else, you will decide it for yourself and no one will steer you toward it.

I could write about this this topic for hours. this is plenty long enough. peace.

[1]: this is directly proportional to the "speed of light", and as this q-value rises, we see more and more "quantum", "telepathy", and "spooky action at a distance" like effects. it seems to be directly related to oxygen and it'll be the subject of future entries, because I think I've figured it out.

[2]: I'm not so sure about this entirely, because it seems that the aztecs, as advanced as they were in understanding the movements of the heavens, seemed to have a terrible fear of cataclysm, to which they would sacrifice virgin girls and do other mind blowing things to try and avoid cataclysm. so, maybe not all of these advanced civilisations, I dunno...


### 2019-10-14 14:39 - a meandering artistic insight into the world of chaos and mayhem

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwkXr83ErpE)

I appreciate thor because I can kind of skip through his videos and he provides me with kind of feeling/perspective into the more mainstream US perspective. in that video he offered an idea which I, by no means listened to the whole thing, found kind of interesting. I perhaps even laughed at it when I first heard it, but it stayed in my head. anything that sticks in my head like that I tend to analyse in a bit more detail. this is that analysis.

he begins by offering the idea that the book of revelation (by st. john the divine) has a "7 year tribulation" period in it. he then postulates that this 7 year tribulation begins on 12-12-12 in correspondence with the mayan calendar[^1].

he then qualifies his hypothesis that it's the 7 years of tribulation by saying that the reason why these last 7 yaers haven't seemed like much of a tribulation is that originally the timeline was way way worse. he then brings up john titor's claims that in his (john titor's origin timeline) syria would begin the next world war, and following soon thereafter, civil war would eventually break out in the states.

---

essentially he's claiming that most all of the major tribulation stuff was actually avoided by timeline corrections.

there are a lot of really weird things going on in the john titor story. I first read about it when I was like 12 or something. we lived in the cartwright house and I remember climbing the tree in the back yard to think about it. it totally consumed me when I was a kid because I was very fascinated with time and the idea of time travel.

I concluded after much thought on the matter that time travel could not be accomplished physically[^2]. I determined that it had to be done "in the spirit" -- and I left the subject alone. afterall, there was no physical evidence of john titor anywhere. the only people who had contact with him was over the internet. john and a pretty fabulous story that to me was barely believable, but it stayed with me over all of these years.

there are some reoccurring themes and other details that stick out to me, like for example, his mission (he claimed) was to find a device which would prevent some sort of catastrophe from happening in *2038*[^3].

next weird thing was this post-civil war rearrangement of society into smaller, he called them "universities" which according to his description of them, sounded to me like medieval villages or pueblos with a university in the centre in place of a church[^4][^5].

another weird thing, and you could claim it was preconditioning, but some time later when I lived in the sunnydale house; I seem to recall I was living in the girls old room (the one with the window that looked out over the awning at the pool), and I had a very very vivid series of dreams which seemed to defy physical reality because I was in a period of time in my life when I was writing my dreams down, and I managed to have three really detailed dreams and write them all down in a manner of 20 minutes (5-something till 6:06 am). I cannot remember the first one right now.

the second one was really really long and I don't remember it all. I just have pieces of it remaining. a civil war broke out in the united states (either I don't remember, or perhaps it wasn't revealed to me why) and some combat started around me. I killed a few soldiers, and grabbed one of their grenades and managed to get it into a tank. I killed a lot of US soldiers, and this was quite notable to the resistance team. I grew in skill and popularity. I really wanted to be a sniper though, and I managed to get an insane amount of key kills and valuable information. I rose up through the ranks and eventually became the leader of the anti-government resistance force. we were located in the centre of the USA, away from the 4 major population centres: LA, NY, florida, and seattle.

I went back to sleep to have the third one: I was on a beach at night and I saw the USA was in dire trouble. when I realised that, immediately I was swept out too far to touch the ocean floor any more and was drowning in the water. my father came and got me up on the beach. as I was laying there, aircraft painted the letters S.O.S. in the sky. I woke up staring right into my alarm clock which had had a power outage and was flashing 6:06am[^5].

additionally, I had many different dreams where I was in different village type situations. this was a reoccurring theme for me in my teenage dreams. even in spain, I had this tendency to like pueblos more than cities, and I'm always harping on and on about these different villages, the global village, the reestablishment of the shaman, gnomitos project similar to mushroom cultures, etc.

and so yes, I have wondered about these different internet "time travelers" like fwh, titor going on about the 2038 thing. then there's the sirians that seem to directly say something like [TODO: find the exact quote] (paraphrasing), "we're entering a time of the 7th ray in power, so pay attention to these archetypes and pick which parts you want to play" I wondered if these things were deliberately left in places where I would find them.

anyway... moving on here.

---

so here's the thing: I've been around the prophetic movement enough to know that the minute you put a time and date on a prophecy, it most certainly fails. in fact, that is one of the tell-tale signs. I have noticed this same effect with different "prophecies" of my own: most people would call them deadlines or task completion. the minute I said a date or time, it *always* fell through. if I just let the prophecy of my completed task or someone's recovery take the time it needs to take, it seemed to work out well or even sometimes ahead of schedule. there really is something to trying to fit something into a schedule where, it takes away the allowance factor and turns it into effort (to try and make the prophesied deadline).

so, when he says that the "7 year tribulation" will end (abruptly?) on 12-12-19, I sort of scoff at the idea. there's nothing that is such a black and white sort of thing. I tend to think of things as a progression. however, even though things are always a progression, you could imagine a timeline split or a catastrophe as an abrupt change, so I dunno maybe...

as I was thinking about this last night, when I came in to roll a cigarette, I had a sudden sensation of depression. previously, I noted that there was extra sexual excitement in the air. I believe last night they were running another set of dream experiments with the girls, and the depression I felt was their response to yet another catastrophic outcome. it seems like whenever I engage in sexual activity (probably when I orgasm), I become the recipient of a huge amount of energy, and their system needs to neutralise this energy to prevent me from going up a dimension. this probably kills me or something quite awful. I believe their depression is upon the realisation that there's just no real way for me to have sex and avoid this event happening.

however, I don't *need* to have sex to go up a dimension. I can gradually become a better and better recipient of this source energy *without* sex, too. I get it that during orgasm, you become a much better recipient of source energy[^7], however, I am slowly little by little working my way up to point where my everyday experience is receiving so much energy, it would be as if I were orgasming 24/7. eventually, I will reach the energetic point where I pass the barrier and am able to allow myself to become a better recipient of this source energy, without sex; that is and has been my stated goal.

whenever this happens, I imagine that it could create an "imcompatible reality" and therefore a time split. who knows though, I personally think it's going to be exactly like 12-12-12 was, and exactly nothing will occur.

in addition to this, I have had the personal belief that the 12-12-12 event was actually delayed until 12-12-16[^8][^9]. the 2012 day was rather uneventful for me. I think I had a bottle of whiskey and an abraham playlist queued up on youtube as I sat in a large house thinking about how the raquel thing went so wrong; that's pretty much it.

2016 was a far more eventful day for me. it marked the beginning of a bunch of turmoil that has not really waned since then. today, I would say that it's still accelerating dramatically, and I don't really believe that in 7 short weeks, I will have become receptive (that is, released enough energy) to actually go up another dimension yet. to me that part seems a bit hokey, and I don't believe it one minute, because from my perspective it feels like I still have quite a ways to go.

however, you can imagine that pretty shortly I will begin to experience another dimension, and I'll gradually make my way there. I don't really think it's going to be so dramatic, such that on 12-12-19 I'm going to be watching stars and one half of the world will watch me go up a dimension and begin to fly, while the other half of the world watches me get electrocuted to death, follow by a huge coverup and lots of mysterious details and lots of secrets. I doubt it, lol -- know what I mean?

maybe something like that will happen in the future, but to me it makes no difference. for me, I just go steady one small increment at a time. I'm not in the business of prophesying arrival times or deadlines.

to be continued...

[1]: and also terence's timewave

[2]: the next time I encountered "time travel" was on the same site that I found the sirian guide to human development and KUTHUMI's musings on the origins of humankind. the author claims that the sirians are capable of physical time travel and used source energy to be able to accomplish it.

[3]: I'm well aware that the rollover of the 32-bit unix epoch is in 2038 as well. for the majority of my life this is what I thought it was, too -- until fwh told me I had until 2038. then I started to really think about this quite a bit, because I found it very hard to believe that the duration of my life was now directly tied to some catastrophe that the 32-bit unix epoch rolls over. I lived through the year 2000 freakout, and software was updated and nothing happened. I was quite sure that exactly nothing would happen in 2038 from a 32-bit integer overflow.

[4]: I didn't really get this until I lived in spain and went traveling around to so many tiny pueblos. every single one of them has a church in the middle and it's usually the biggest building in the centre plaza area.

[5]: it also occurred to me after some time that this was the "archaic revival" that terence had been carrying on so much about. it was a redistribution of the population into smaller population centres.

[6]: there are a few things wrong with this alarm clock thing. it was in the time in LA where brownouts or short cutoffs from the power seemed to happen a few times a month, but if my alarm clock was turned off by a power outage, the power outage would have had to of occurred roughly 6 hours previous to me waking up. I woke up to write the other dreams down and I think I usually timestamped them too, so I don't know why I wouldn't have noticed my clock reset. the other weird thing is I clearly remember that I *had* looked at my clock after the first dream, because I noticed that I managed to have all these dreams and write them all down in an impossibly short period of time. I dunno.

[7]: and, much like child birth, when a large amount of this energy passes through your body, if you can release resistance, it doesn't have to be a painful thing at all and can be extremely pleasurable. reaching never before felt heights of orgasm can be the same way assuming the resistance to allowing the energy to flow isn't present.

[8]: my reasoning behind this is that if we were to continue on the technological curve without the 9/11 event in 2001, I'm pretty sure that the nosebook technology would have been ready for 2012, however the technical setback that was experienced from the emotional fallout from the 9/11 events and also the retardation of the growth of the internet because of all of the "wiretapping" and "surveillance" measures put in place by the USA. I believe that all of this delayed the 2012 thing by 4 years.

[9]: it was also on that day that I finally revealed that I had embodied the "venus" archetype. reading the sirian guide, 3 characters seemed to stand out to me quite a bit. one was volcrum, to which I have very obvious similarity: we both have a limp, and I made things for zaryn (which I always identified as zeus). the only thing I was missing to be for reals this volcrum guy was venus to be my wife. I never perceived her to be my physical wife. instead, when I had a brain haemorrhage, I had a new entity put inside of me which I identified as a little girl. for me, this marriage was never a literal thing, but a marriage of the two hemispheres of my brain. like clockwork, marcos invited me to come live at his house -- and marcos was someone I was on the lookout for because he completely fit the description the sirians gave as saturn. for me, venus (aphrodite) was always my right brain, and I determined that ... I'm going to continue this story in a future entry. it gets complicated. see: @[entry](2019-10-14 18:08)


### 2019-10-14 17:40 - I'm getting stronger

last night while watching stars, I felt like I got a few vision upgrades, and kept rlaxing further to receive more when I suddenly found myself becoming conscious in a dream-state experience. I was being held away from something. I don't remember much of the beginning part of it, but I do remember that there was this extremely strong circular motion happening on the top of my head, which is actually something I have experienced before and was something that I used to be able to control in the beginning times with raquel before we lived together. I used to practice it on the trains, and often other times. I noticed that when I moved energy around the top of my head as if it were the north pole, I noticed that it had a dramatic dramatic effect on my environment. anyway, this time it didn't feel like the smooth rotation of energy, but felt kind of forced and not really that pleasant. it didn't hurt, but it did feel uncomfortable.

I don't really know how I got into that situation though. I remember I was in this weird place where it seemed like walls kept trying to enclose me in. the feeling in my head seemed to happen when I reached the ceiling (I was levitating upward as these walls seemed to continue to form around me). then, it felt like someone was trying to wrestle me down to the ground. my leg jerked and I knew that I was laying outside because a rush of cold air came in to my feet (even though in my eyes it looked like I was in this tight multi-walled room). I said in my inner voice, "let go of me" and when I did, all of a sudden I could fly towards the walls, but it seemed like the walls never touched me. it was a very weird sensation, because I wasn't running into them, but at the same time it felt like I kept brushing up close to them, but they couldn't stop me.

about this time the dream reality began to fade away from my eyes and I could see the star (capella, I think) again. I had to settle down again, but the whole thing kinda shook me up, and it definitely threw off the rhythm I had established with the star.

either way, I'm gaining more and more strength in my capacity to recognise my different states of being. I'm by no means close to maintaining "consistency of consciousness" between states, but I'm getting far better at controlling things :)

I mainly wanted to share that because, even though it threw me off my groove a bit, it really boosted my confidence in my traversal of different states of reality.

---

what I think happened, is they took my consciousness away and were attempting to do what they do while I sleep where they drain the "light" from my head. sometime after this happened, my desire was still so strong to get get back to the star watching (cause I really want to continue to increase my receptive capabilities) that the dream state me began to fight them, cause I wanted to watch stars so badly, that the conflict made me start to become conscious[^1]. I don't really know how long it was before I became conscious in the dream-state, but it couldn't have been too long because the shadow from the moon had only moved 1-2 inches from were it was when I just drank from the watter bottle a few minutes previous -- so, not that long :)

[1]: it seems to be the pattern that every time there is conflict or strong desire for things to be different, then I start to regain consciousness. it seems that if they're not trying to force things, then my astral-self(?) doesn't mind interacting with them.


### 2019-10-14 18:08 - thoth, venus, saturn, and vulcrum.

this is a continuation of the note I began to leave in @[entry](2019-10-14 14:39).

I was telling the story about how it turned out (and I definitely didn't plan this), that on 12-12-16 I finally revealed that I had embodied the "venus" archetype.

when reading the sirian guide back in 2011, the thoth, venus, and vulcrum characters seemed to stand out to me quite a bit.

volcrum and I have one very obvious similarity: we both have a limp, and the second is that volcrum also made things for zeus; I made things for zaryn (which I always identified as zeus/jupiter). so, that one was easy.

however, I always knew myself to be not one, but two characters because I had the brain haemorrhage. during the brain haemorrhage, a very very radiant being which I immediately knew as "jesus" appeared before me and asked me for my cooperation. I very very exicitedly agreed, telling him that I don't really know much, but I really think there's a good thing going there and I wanted to be a part of it in any way that I could. from then on I new had this new personality inside of my left side (right brain) which frustrated me to no end. to me, this side felt like a little girl. she seemed very "exigente" and demanding, yet powerful but with a feeling of fragility. I (kenny), the left brain cared for her and protected her, but she frequently got me into difficult situations. we've had quite a bit of a difference of opinion on certain matters. it frustrated me to no end, because she would totally throw a wrench into a situation, totally destroying whatever it was that seemed valuable to me, anr she didn't care one single bit. her atttude was always something of, "deal with it bro! it'll be fine"

this is clearly the destructive side of venus. she's also quite charming. I learned to just sit back and watch myself talk to other people when I was in lower resistance situations (drunk or stoned) and she seemed to have an immediate charisma about her that could charm anybody. I learned to be fearless because I no matter how rough the situation, I could just sit back and watch her work her magic. I (kenny) have learned quite a bit from her and have since adopted (assimilated) the majority of her personality into my own. she's pure power, and I'm like this master organiser of ideas and we inhabit the same body.

it works out quite well when we can both get our energy going in the same direction. I've learned to not even attempt to try and fight her. what she wants *is* what we're doing. as such, I've found it quite useful to adopt so much of her personality, so that we're on the same page[^1].

she's "controlled" emotionally. meaning, she's basically like putting a super amplifier on to emotion to where whatever she feels *has* to become reality.

ok, back to the story here. so, I clearly perceive myself as two of these characters, not one, and they are vulcrum and venus. in the sirian guide, the triad where these two exist is with saturn. remember, after a crazy set of events on mdma I could clearly see that my objective was to begin the equalisation process of these two hemispheres. I'm encouraged to recognise the symbols of these characters so I'm on the lookout for a "saturn" guy. as usual, the proper people appear in my life at the right moments (even if I have trouble recognsing it at first) and marcos invites me to come to his house to live and work on a project I had been wanting to create since essembly closed down.

marcos perfectly fit the symbols of saturn:

```
Saturn, FOURTH RAY, Keeper of the Law; particularly the laws of karma. Note that he does not make the laws or judge but administers them. Saturn in Atlantis was called Dwul Quin. His job within the group was to see that all was done according to laws that best suited the purpose. Dwul Quin arrived on earth in the vehicle descended from a pterodactyl type bird. His skin was gray and eyes were beryl ringed with amber. He was a quiet, somber creature taking his serious job very seriously. Needless to say, his looks nor personality endeared him to humanity, so much so, that when humanity chose a creature to represent their devil they picked Dwul Quin, alias Saturn-Satan.
```

somehow a problem developed with his daughter (andrea), who I would not hestitate to identify symbolically also as venus. you all know that story there.

after that whole thing fell though, I'm sitting at vera's house smoking weed with her when all of a sudden I have this realisation that this jesus guy just simply transfers his consciousness between bodies and I'm just the latest version of that. this was the beginnings of the san junipero idea.

when we come back I will talk about how this all ties in together with thoth.

[1]: it's a good thing that I've learned so much from her because nosebook has her pretty well shut down. however, I think they're probably beginning to realise that she always gets her way, and any attempts to do something otherwise result in certain destruction.

###  2019-10-16 10:15 - heading in the direction you point yourself consciously

I had an interesting reaction from the neighbour which provoked some thoughts on the subject of navigation, which I decided I wanted to actually write down.

the reaction was about the whole thing kind of spiralling out of control a bit. I wouldn't disagree. I think it's going to become a huge mess here shortly. the main reason is I really want to go in the direction of what's wanted. I'm constantly trying to figure out different ways to go that way. the last time I was smoking, that was what I was carrying o about the whole time, trying to find ways to kind of ease things in without any big jumps.

since then, it appears that things have worsened a bit (a lot?), and it seems as if there is even more conscious determination to go in the direction of what's wanted (for them). they don't *really* want to try and control everyone and everything, and they know they don't really want to also, because if they were going in the direction of what's wanted, there wouldn't need to be so many secrets. they really want secrets.

well, I tell you what there's no faster way to get more secrets that need to be kept, than to have to try and cover up another disaster that they caused, know what I mean? this is clearly the direction they want to go, because they're giving all their attention to making sure all the unwanted stuff they've done or created remains a secret.

---

when I was at the beginning part of my disaster, zaryn, raquel, mom, luke, etc. were all telling me that things were headed in a bad direction, but I was unable to hear them. I had already given far too much attention to unwanted things in my past, that momentum in my life toward disaster was quite literally unstoppable.

it would have been pretty close to impossible for me to try and steer something with that much momentum in a different direction. I simply *had* to crash and burn, then once I've crashed, momentum is pretty near to zero, so then it's much easier to pick a different direction toward something wanted.

jerry has mentioned this on numerous occasions, and I've found that the real reason why crashes need to occur is because it's hard to turn something going real fast. imagine a fighter jet going mach 3. if all of a sudden, the pilot wanted to go exactly in the opposite direction he's currently headed, he would need to either slow way down first or take a very wide turn, because if he were to turn and pull down hard on the stick making a really tight turn, the blood would rush out from his head and he would black out.

anything with a lot of speed or momentum cannot easily be turned around without causing difficulties for anything inside of it. this is just how physics works; it's a property (law) of the universe.

---

right now, our realities have too much in common with each other, so we continue to share the same reality.

every possible version of you exists, there are more advanced versions of yourself and there are less advanced versions of yourself as well. however, you experience yourself through your consciousness and you navigate between all these different versions of yourself consciously by the way you feel. when you feel better than ok (with yourself and your environment), you're headed in the direction of all the good (wanted) things that are "in your vortex". likewise, when you do not feel less than ok, you are headed in the of all of the unwanted things "in your vortex".

you navigate this consciously by making decisions to perceive your environment and yourself differently so that you feel better about them. every time you do this, your consciousness moves between each of these infinite yous that exist.

you might say, well, then all these other mes are kind of like zombies or something? well, no they're all reactionary. they are all creating by default, and their reality is in perfect harmony with how they feel. you could think of all of these other yous as automatons, and they live, learn, interact, etc. exactly the same way that you would, given that you live in a reality that feels that way.

however, you have a non-physical part about you which has desire to feel differently than the way you do right now. when you want (desire) to feel better, it will offer you a way toward feeling better. however, here on the physical plane, we're often times not so connected to that non-physical part, and we have other ideas of things that can make us feel better. so, in our state of disconnection, we can't get those clues so easily, so we default to using our logic to reason our way toward the things that will feel better. that's where it goes all wrong, because the logic that we are taught growing up does not usually take emotion into account.

much of our logic tells us to feel bad, and we do not really understand that anything feels better than depression or disempowerment or powerlessness. most of our society teaches us to even if it feels bad, follow the guidance of the authorities. most of our society teaches disempowerment until you've jumped through all the contrived hoops, so that that those with power can grant you a sliver of power. until you've met their contrived set of conditions, you are forced to live a life in a state of powerlessness.

---

none of that matters though, because you have all the power. you can feel exactly how you want to feel, and eventually those that are incompatible with how you feel will vibrate out of your experience.

this is precisely what has been happening in my life. I have generated logic such that it is now inconceivable for me to possibly entertain thoughts any more that don't feel good. it does not matter any more to me what anyone else is doing or any other perceived power they may have over me, my direction is headed in a way which feels good.

I am secure in my knowing that my consciousness is moving in a direction that feels good, and that's why I'm not at all concerned about anything that is happening. there is nothing that they could possibly do to try and disempower me anymore because I am nearly 100% in control of how I feel now.

this is where I hope to see all of humankind in the future, but in order for that to be so, there needs to be some really disconnected people with very strong logic telling them that they need to ensure that everyone, cept for the cool kids, are all disempowered, and that they hold the keys to material empowerment, so they are in control and there are lots of people depending on them for their feeling of empowerment. that's the illusion they have built up to believe that is the only way that they can feel good. when they have all of that, *then* they can move in the direction of what's wanted.

---

that's kind of the bigger picture, so you can imagine that right now while they still believe that I am their path toward feeling better, and while I still have not yet made 100% certainty that the have no power over the way I feel, our realities still cohabitate. soon though, I will no longer capable of being their road to feeling better, so our realities will become incompatible. people who want to maintain their disempowerment reality will continue on with them. those who are resonant with my "emotions navigate your reality" message will come with me.

you can imagine that it's sort of like a tug-of-war sort of thing, but eventually the tie is going to break and, like a slingshot aiming at a target, the time taken to take aim and pull the projectile back, the projectile is moving *away* from the intended direction (cause you're pulling it back). so, even though it looks like we're moving *away* from the intended direction right now, it's gathering more and more potential energy which will be converted to kinetic energy as soon as the compabible reality rope breaks.

we have no real way of knowing what that reality will be like because it'll be so different than the one we're experiencing now, so it's really difficult to predict anything other than more and more tension. just hold on and remember to find ways to perceive your reality in a way which feels good.

---

remember that every possible version of you exists, and you navigate with your emotions.


### 2019-10-16 11:51 - an interesting thought experiment

continuing on from the narrative in the previous entry:

I will eventually transfer my consciousnesses back into their reality again (along with many others of you) to gain even better capacity to navigate with our emotions, and to setup another pretty epic situation similar to what is happening now. this is the way to eternal life, or the path to immortality that tesla mentioned.

---

so, you may wonder to yourself, doubting that the entire planet will follow me back into this timeline, what will happen then when we all leave? well, those who are not conscious will all be on creation by default, so whatever happens when a civilisation makes it to hyperspace :) I dunno yet. we'll have to find out...

it'a kind of an interesting thought experiment because assuming that in this coming time split, their consciousness all heads in the direction of unwanted -- to be able to readjust their direction easier without a whole lot of momentum -- that means that "they" (minus their consciousness) are still going to be here, so they're going to become another of thee many other versions of theirself, creating by default in the space that feels the way it feels.

so, if a whole bunch of people who consciously choose to feel good, all peace out to go to a different timeline, what will happen to the consciousnesses that don't choose to go? I really don't know. if enough people consciously choosing to feel good, go, then would it become another crash and burn for them? I dunno... I guess it's up to them.


### 2019-10-17 08:47 - thoughts on creating your reality feeling and emotion

I got the sense this morning that the reaction that I felt yesterday was incorrect, however, it evoked the previous entry and I think that was important. I felt the relevant parts were the ones where I mentioned that even though it looks like we're moving away from the intended destination, it's like a slingshot, where at first you are accumulating potential energy as you move away from the target as the projectile is pulled back. this is really how all "contrast" works. you can think of "unwanted" as the pulling back of the slingshot. when released (going in the wanted direction) it goes way way further than it did in the pulling back (unwanted) direction.

second, I wanted to mention that because so much potential energy has accumulated, there's no way to really know what it'll be like because it'll be so much different than it is now. this seems to be the nature of this sort of extended accumulation of contrast before finally going in the direction of what's wanted. you find the direction of what's wanted emotionally.

---

however, all that is great and stuff but it really gives no real explanation of how to do that emotional navigation. while thinking about it this morning, I came up with some thoughts that I had never thought before. I never thought about them this way because emotion for is already essentially reality. however, I get the sense that she's a more detail oriented person than I am, so I was thinking about it from a new perspective, where details are perceived and that produces emotions. so, here are some thoughts.

I will begin as always by recognising that any time something feels bad, that means the thing (or it's details) are being perceived from a perspective which doesn't feel good.

so, all one would need to do is to find a way to change that perspective, right? it's easier than it may seem at first.

I think of details as a certain sort of expectation. expectations are a combination of your desire and your belief about how those desires should/could manifest in reality. we're logical beings and we know that certain things should be a certain way to feel good. we know that houses should remain standing during a blustery day, plumbing should work, doors should open, etc. -- for it to be a proper house. that part everyone can agree on, so we're not talking about that, so in this case details would take the form of trying to figure out all of the decorations and furniture before the house is even built.

it's almost always easier to work out the details once the structure is built. the structure is all of those expectations about what should work (these have accumulated from past experience of unwanted) and the way it feels.

for example, let's say you want a kitchen that has a island thing, a dishwasher, a granite sink and good lighting. it sounds really good and wanted, but I would say that it may be more difficult to find a house with that exact kitchen than it would be to just know that all of the expectations based on unwanted are a given (eg. no broken plumbing, leaking garbage disposals, etc.) and instead feel the way you want to feel when you're in the kitchen.

after all, the reason you have come to the conclusion that you want all of those details, os because you want to feel a certain way while you're in your kitchen (and you think those details will make that feeling possible).

also, admittedly it does seem possible that there are potentially other kitchen designs which could feel the same or better, and the current kitchen idea is just the latest in long series of kitchen dreams. there may be better versions, but they're going to be near to impossible to find looking at a million specifications and blueprints. so then, what we're looking for are kitchens that *feel* better than the previously imagined height of kitchenhood.

---

how do we go about that though? here we are in the present and the kitchen in front of me is not what I want it to be. I know it can be so much more. I like to pick out all of the things that feel bad to me. these are my clues to the improvements what I want. when I say, feel, I mean feel, so like identifying that the electricity next to the sink is rotting is *not* what I'm talking about. perhaps the kitchen feels dingy or unmaintained. identifying that is the key because you want the kitchen to feel like it's new or well maintained.

once focused on the way the kitchen feels bad (let's say it feels dingy and unmaintained), then all of a sudden it feels like a complete no-brainer to get he electricity fixed next to the sink. that and likely many other things, like say accumulation of crud in the grout, all seem like things that need to be done to make the kitchen feel the way you want it to feel.

---

that example was a repair situation though, so what about the house that's not yet built? admittedly it seems a lot easier to determine ahead of time how you would want the unbuilt house to feel, yet very few people actually put much effort into conceptualising how the new house will feel; instead, they just expect the new house (or girlfriend) to feel good because it's new.

my favourite technique is to find the feeling of something and try to hold it for as long as I can before my imagination spins off into some sort of "visualisation" of what I'm feeling. these "visualisations" are kind of like mini-realities and a lot can be determined from them. once the scene plays out a little bit, you will have a feeling response to that idea. then, I like to take that feeling and and figure out how to make it better. if the feeling had unwanted parts, I try to figure out what is the opposite that feeling of unwanted and then try again.

this process of holding the feeling it's kind of an artform. children do it with ease. that is in fact what they are doing most of their childhood. for us adults, we're so goal oriented, it seems too trivial for something like this to be so easy. if it feels like it's not luxurious enough, then obviously it should feel more luxurious -- that's it! if it feels difficult, it should feel easy. more specifically, imagine you see someone with big boobs and you're a child, so you imagine yourself with big boobs and feel how that feels. maybe you don't like how that feels physically. maybe you never thought about how it feels physically, but instead were fixated on how it makes you feel more maternal or something. the refinement process is iterative and comes from observation of things wanted and unwanted, just like a child does. it's so simple, it feels perhaps almost too childlike.

it really is that easy though.


### 2019-10-17 09:52 - emotion and structure

while writing the previous entry, I happened upon another idea which I hadn't thought about before. I'm going to kind of think about it "out loud" here.

> the structure is all of those expectations about what should work (these have accumulated from past experience of unwanted) and the way it feels.

previously I had always thought about the structure of something as some sort of formulation of mathematical like logic, showing the dimensions and shape of the way it should be, but it occurred to me when writing that, that wanted is clearly desire, and unwanted I had always perceived to be desire in reverse. for example the desire for security is the opposite of fear.

however, it seems apparent to me now that fear is a manifestation of *desire*, not of unwanted.

unwanted is actually the structure. I gave the example of the house that you know you want to have properly operating doors, resilience to bursts of wind, and one other thing... anyway, I didn't realise that structure is actually the accumulation of all of the things unwanted

(I just turned off my spell checker so things may get kind of bad spelling from here on out, however the characters appear on the screen much faster now, yay. maybe I'll actually reread what I wrote -- but lol, I doubt it.)

---

before I bring in the emotion aspect to it, imagine how DNA may work. there are literally bazillions of different ways that cells could fit together to create complex structures, but the majority of them do not make useful things. if you were to write a genetic algorithm, one of the things that needs to be avoided is to keep trying things that don't work. the majority of DNA would be a predefined structure, like say a human or an animal, all of the the different species share a core genetic structure (genus), so probably the core variables are not very easily influenced, but stuff outside of that core genus, nature is constantly experimenting with and trying new things out. each attempt would probably create a non-coding dna bit that essentially says, "don't make this; it doesn't work".

looking in the long term, imagine something like a drastic change in engvironmental conditions where more and more experimental species fail, there would a huge accumulation of a whole lot of non-coding fails, such that after a while the complexity of stuff you don't want to do arrives to be so much that there's all this stuff that doesn't work floating around, that some (unknown to me) process occurrs which takes all of these unwanted non-coding strands and creates an entirely new genus.

I think the easiest one for me to perceive would be the dinosaurs. imagine that all of a sudden gravity increased drastically, nature would all of a sudden have lots and lots of failed species that are no longer capable of walking, so that the gnome keeps evolving to become lighter and lighter until what we know as bird birds emerge from all of this "unwanted"

---

above, I said "unknown to me" -- because I do not really understand how emotions work on vibrational level and how they influence our gnome, but I imagine that what we call emotion, has a striking effect on the genetic structure of organisms.

so imagine that some sort of thing is in the middle of evolution. I defined the structure of that organism as the expections of how things should work, so there needs to be a feedback mechanism which "selects" the ones that work from the ones that do not. this feedback mechanism can be perceived as a sort of meta-conceptual structure or language which reacts or produces some sort of feedback based on how things "feel" when they're working (and when they're not working).

it's really interesting to look at out genetic code as an extension of this emotional construction we tend to take for granted. there probably really is very strong merit to the idea that our bodies (and gnome) is highly influenced by the way we feel in the abstract sense regarding the way we feel as we travel through life, and not just in the physical performance sense of being able to fly, walk, swim or run, with ease.


### 2019-10-18 10:25 - enjoy jaron's form of perception

before all of this occurred I was sitting outside staring at the clouds when I had a few realisations that seemed more than normal. first, take the idea that since they have shown up in my life, I have had literally *zero* successful things. not one thing I've put my mind to has turned out successfully since they've been involved in my life. obviously this isn't the case for everyone in the world, but it will likely become the case for jaron now.

after that, I realised that they do not want me to be successful. they actively work hard to make sure I am not successful. I kept getting the phrase come into my head, "we're not manipulating and controlling, right abraham?" that came along with my thinking about how they're trying their hardest to steer the unsteerable people, which will, considering LOA, only make their unsteerable people problem bigger. I determined that they're going to try and make the whole population unsteerable by focusing all your attention on the unsteerable ones.

thinking about that I realised that they don't actually learn from their mistakes; instead, they just cover them up. they really perceive theirselves as failures and so that no one else ever finds out how big of a failure they perveive theirselves to be, they need to cover up their falures so they don't have to learn from them (lol).

after those series of realisations, I went inside to wait for the clouds to clear only to find myself in the beginning of a weird set of events which took place starting with them force ejaculating me in this bizarre dream with melissa where we were fighting(wrestling?) and I had to reach around her to put my hand on her vagina or something weird like that. when I barely even touched it, that's when the typical feeling of forced ejaculation came. my butt hurt a little but not nearly as much as the times previous.

I then had these weird things where I would go between dream and wake state for a some time while greg gave jaron a pep-talk about his relationship with zara. I finally fell asleep after that and woke up at 3am with the idea in my mind, "fine you don't want me to watch stars, then I won't watch stars. I can just take a break from it for a long time. we'll just see how that works out" I went out to smoke a cigarette and think about it. it seemed like a reasonable isea. "you can't get it wrong and you can't get it done."

then there was this weird dream I had where I was put inside of this police place and told to wait. I needed to go to the bathroom, but it seemed as if there was none. I talked to this mexican guy in spanish but he suddenly didn't know how to speak in spanish, then he tured into a little girl with a pacifier who kinda knew spanish, but she clearly didn't understand things like, "then this place doesn't have a bathroom?" I guess they allowed me to wake up after that and I had a terrible time trying to pee.

---

anyway... enough about that story. I think I figured out what's happening. the reason why jaron has had all of these appointments that have been incorrect the last few days when I haven't fell asleep when they thought I would, and the reason why jaron made a funny reaction this morning when I said "to make sure and feel as bad as possible when going to the therapist; you don't want to go to the doctor when you're well" is because (presumably) he's not going to the therapist.

it feels like they have been been trying to get me and jaron to sleep at the same time, so that they can presumably move people's imaginations over from my form of perception to jaron's form of perception. I think this has been happening for some time now, but they have rapidly acceledrated it probably because they feel some sort of deadline is approaching.

---

there are a few things that I will mention here, because they stood out to me. one, if I decided to simply stop watching stars, then there's no risk of me going up a dimension any more. how in the world am I going to go up if I completely stop increasing my energy output. the only way that I would go up, is if they decided to stop holding my back -- which means there's not going to be a time split, because they will have conscoiusly chosen that path.

second, jaron is a whole lot more compliant and "steerable" than I am. he just does what the authority in his life tells him to do and still believes that the people telling him what to do have his best interests in mind. he is in that regard much more vibrationally similar to the rest of the world. so having the rest of the world now on his form of perception will probably make amazon's lives easier now, because people will be more likely take jaron's form of perception, which is to just do what they're told/expected to do by the parents/authorities. great! I guess that's one solution to the realisation I had earlier about there being millions of people who want to be steered, and they choose me (and probably henrietta too because I realised that the reason why it all of a sudden felt bad was probably because of some sort of attempt to use her to steer), as the ones they want to try and force or steer. that sure is one way to do it, that I hadn't thought of myself... I suppose we'll see how that goes.

---

one thing that I hadn't really thought of until putting these pieces together though, is perhaps there may be exeptions to this rule though. they're going to try and cling on to this timeline for as long as they can and steer it as best as they can, so there will be all sorts of extra contrast, which will increase energetic output. in addition, I think that my form of perception was far more compatible with everyone else that perhpas jaron's may be, so I find it likely that will produce stronger desire in other people for a form of perception which is more compatible.

this is where I think the girls could really come into play here. imagine that we're now doing stuff together and they manage to break out into their own form of perception and imagine that other people having the same experience follow along. this could mean that jaron's form of perception is considered the default form of perception, then the girls as they begin to go up will allow people options for new forms of perception. I guess that could be kind of cool :)

---

I guess we'll have to see. and, I'm not totally sold on this whole no star watching thing anymore. I'll probably flip s coin to decide it cause perhaps that decision was exactly what was needed for them to begin moving people over to jaron's form of perception. I dunno.

maybe the timeline split is actually at the "end", when I make my transition into a multi-bodied experience. things keep changing, so I dunno really.


### 2019-10-19 15:04 - turning perception of unwanted into something wanted

my ability to do this is, as far as I can tell, completely unmatched my anyone else. in the previous enthy, I outlined how jaron's form of perception becoming the default allows for the girls to offer a new form of perception. that got some pretty negative reactions to it. aparently the idea of girls providing a form of perception for others is absolutely unacceptable.

anyway... it happened again this morning. the day previous, I felt as if I or something was being forced with the henrietta thing. perhaps they believed that with around, then they could get her to waste my time or something (I have no idea).

anyway, last night while star watching after a bit of a vibe dive after they put me to sleep for a while, I got up started watching sirius instead and remembered what the sirians said in their guide...

> The THIRD RAY divides the power of the FIRST into manifold creations. Its subsidiaries, the FIFTH and SEVENTH makes the forms and binds the life to the form respectively.

> The SEVENTH RAY can create illusions for everyone to see; the FIRST RAY can give life to the illusion and make it an illusion no more - but alive. The SEVENTH RAY is jovial, gallant and entertaining, but the FIRST RAY is seriously deadly or deadly serious.

> The SEVENTH RAY is most vital on the physical plane for it forces the substance into forms best suited to the purpose of the indwelling life. The SEVENTH RAY is lord of order by forms. The SEVENTH RAY works closely with the FIRST RAY. When the form no longer meets the need of the indwelling life, the SEVENTH RAY calls the FIRST RAY who then shatters the form, freeing the life so that it can progress and the substance can be reused by the SEVENTH RAY.

> And of course the FIRST RAY wants to destroy the whole mess and start over - frequently!

... I can't find it right now, but to to paraphase, it essentially said that a first ray can act as if they were a first ray (and viceaversa). obviously the correlary applies to 2nd and 6th and 5th and 3rd, but I wanted to note that although it seems my left side is displays nearly all of the attributes of a first ray female, I have at times noticed this jovial 7th ray charm show up all the time. in addition to this, the 5th ray male, volcrum seems to be pretty good at this stuff, and 3rd ray (his other side) can "divide the power into manifold creations" ...

essentially, I'm saying that I contain quite a proficioncy in 1st, (now) 3rd, 5th, and 7th ray capabilities. this isn't to be surprising, because the sirians begin with this in their opening message:

> Your physical plane science works from the physical upward; spiritual works are usually attempted from the highest attainable level downwards - we will work on all at once.

> As your thinking shifts from the mundane, physically-oriented, and personality-identified self; there will be a great need for **BALANCE**. You will have to work at balancing the pairs of opposites. You will have to consciously endeavor to balance your spiritual and physical activities.

so, with a strong emphasis on balance and consciousness on *all* planes of existance at once, it is no suprise to me that I am gaininng notable proficiency on these 4 primary planes. the 3 transition planes are coming next, for me as I do very little relating and utilise my imagination very little as well.

in not such a long amount of time, I should be proficient and conscious on all of these planes at once. (right now I would only consider myself mostly conscious on the 1st and 5th)

---

ok so obviously henrietta represents the first ray and last nigst in particular I was particularly happy about this, "The SEVENTH RAY can create illusions for everyone to see; the FIRST RAY can give life to the illusion and make it an illusion no more - but alive"

I hadn't really thought about it much in that sense, because I do not really see myself much as a performer or a magician so I never really paid much attention to this idea, but as I'm gaining more and more 7th ray qualities, I find it now very exciting to thing of just the possibilities of what this means! all I have to do is to create something in my mind, project the "illusion" into 3d space and find a way to build desire in her to want to play with it, and it can become alive. obviously we'd start with things like puppies and small critters, but as she learns to develop this skill and use it consciously, the possibilities are truly mind boggling... *ANYTHING* I can come up with in my imaginataion, I thought to myself.

it gets better than that as well, because I display so many characteristics of a first ray female as well, there's quite literally no reason why I couldn't learn to do the same thing. imagine if I were capable of being around a person life tesla. the motors that he saw which were "real before his eyes" -- I could learn to make those "real" things things manifest in reality. !!!! the possibilites are so infinite, I cannot explain how amazing this idea is to me.

---

well so yeah, that had a pretty serious negative reaction as well. I guess they're not interested in me figuring out how to make physical things with my mind. doesn't matter thoough, because no matter what they can come up with to try and limit me, I have become master at turning a perception of unwanted into something wanted.

in fact even this morning, I decided it was ok to explain to mom (and by proxy them) how I was capable of attining so many vision upgrades, and I revealed the geometry of the eye. at first they were using a grid pattern to try to figure out the space in my eye each time my vision improves. now, they're using a crosshatch pattern to try and figure it out, but I revealed this morning the reason why I believe it's actually a 5-sided pattern they will need to use, based on frank chester's work on the lens of the eye (and also the south pole) being derived from his 7-sided form.

anyway, I feel confident in doing that because now they're free to try and hold me for as long as they want to. let's say they figure out a way to go up visual levels with my eyes with ease now... I'll explain in a future entry what I think this could entail, but they have all of the power now. I can turn any "unwanted" thing into something wanted, it's not a problem if they decide to hold me in this dimension for as long as they can. every step along the way, my realisation of what is wanted will only get bigger and bigger. how big is big enough? I dunno, it's up to them now :)


### 2019-10-24 10:03 - the effect of DMT on the brain

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/ExrihN6vjYM?t=7357)

```
questioner:
what does DMT do in the brain as a nurotransmitter?

terence:
we don't know. nobody knows what it's doing there, and as long as the government makes it impossible for science to pursue rational answers to these kinds of questions, it's not likely we'll ever find out.

the best guess so far is that it mediates attention. that, for instance if there were to be a noise over here or a movement and I turn -- that's a little spike of DMT makes that possible. it's where you suddenly narrow your awareness and prooject it deeply into a single small confined area.
```

terence's answer was very enlightening to me and helped me to understand what is happening when I watch stars. he's essentially saying that DMT regulates how your brain focuses, or rather that it's a symbiotic relationship. when focusing, DMT increases, which is why meditatating will increase DMT levels in the brain, and why instensly focusing on a star will also increase DMT levels in the brain. so, when focusing intently on anything really, it seems to increase DMT levels.

there was another thing that terence talked about in a different talk about human's relationship with drugs, and how caffiene is essentially the only state-approved drug, because it increases productivity and focus.

amazon playing around with the DMT levels in people's brains is probably the new version of state-approved productivity enhancing caffiene. it can allow for people to be more productive and focus more intently which is good in a mechanistic culture where everyone is just considered a cog in the big machine.

---

however, you maybe have noticed that maybe too much attention and focus can become something they don't want. they are deeply troubled when I get my hands on coffee, weed, or other things that increase my ability to focus, because likely this tells my brain to make more DMT, and that's probably something they don't want (for me).

so, what they have been doing is regulating my ablity to focus. this is what they have been doing and has prevented me from making any serious progress on anything I've set my mind to since they've intruded into my life experience.

---

so, now looking at this from the point of view of what may be happening in peoole'a brains that are not my own has some interesting things. it seems to me that DMT levels are greately enhanced in *everyone's* brain -- or, at least the ones that are around me. from my perspective, it appears to me like the entire world is going through a drug experience, yet without having any of the hallucinatory effects. what I mean is, when I observe others and (but mostly) myself on heightened states of DMT, I notice that I am much more presently focused -- that is, I seem to be much more centred around the idea of what is happening right now (in this crazy experience) and I seem much more inclined to take risks and want to discover new things, that I normally wouldn't pursue either[^1].

so, when I see a bunch of people kind of floating around totally chilled out about this mind bending reality our planet has entered into, I cannot help but to see a bunch of seriously psychologically influenced people. they're not being influenced by a drug, but by something with nearly the same effects. from my perspective, it really looks like they are manipulating as best as they can where people put their focus.

---

it's kind of funny to me to think about the long-term effects that this will have because, it looks to me like they're attempting to utilise this as second-generation caffiene, but what they're going to produce is a whole lot of people with my level of sensitivity. oh sure, they'll be able to control it for a while, but the problem will continue to expand just like what's happening in my life.

I have never had such a difficult time focusing my energy (physically or mentally) on anything as I have since the end of 2012 when raquel and I broke up. I figured at first the loss of focus was to do with the breakup, but I'm actually convinced now that previously when I would focus I would create more DMT, and this has become now a highly regulated thing in my brain, where I'm running on a very low capacity. howover, I keep finding more and more ways to increase my ability to focus and so even though they have their intended levels that I should be at to maintain what they would consider a normal experience[^2].

so, because DMT acts like an amplifier of attention, which is why you perceive "more", I can now see clearly that this situation we're all now in is just making the extremes even more extreme. I will place people now into four categories, excluding the "no change" category, because I believe that even if it looks like there is no change, that's only the neutralisation effect to try and maintain a sense of normalcy. these people will fall into the cantegory of increased pursuit for discovery (of technical subjects, science, arts, boobs, or hotter girls, it doesn't matter), or decreased desire for noveltiy and an emphasis on stability over risk or unchanging subject matter.

the effect does not seem to be a universal applicant of desire for more discovery, but seems to have this effect on all areas of one's life at once, amplifiying them all. I imagine that, *in some areas*, people stuck in their ways are raelly getting stuck hard and at the same time, *in other areas*, people are really gaining a stronger sense of increased sense of focus and discovery. however, both of them: the stuck areas and the areas of desire for incraesed discovery (alike) are likely experiencing a dampening force applied to that amplification, which is this normalisation process of trying to hold everyone's DMT levels at a "normal" spot[^3].

basically, what I'm saying is that everyone who does not on the "more" train will eventually disappear or learn to embrace the "more" (lol I sound like daft punk here). when I say embrace the "more", I mean both sides: more discovery, suspicion, paranoia, perception, attention, awarenesss, etc. or, more stuckness, more monotony, more predicitability, or more control. it goes both ways. things are going to get WAAAAYYY extreme here, and it's all because the effect seemed to have the effect on them as wanting more control.

welcome to the DMT dream :)

[1]: however, I have observed this same effect in other people (or in myself, when for example I'm *reallly* stoned), and they seem to be less inclined to take risks. it seems to be an amplifier in the way of discovery, actually. so instead of taking risks, I would say that it implifies the desire to pursue discovery. or, the opposite end of that is, for example on a bad trip, the side where I just want to stick to what I already know and not discover anything new. I think children typically have more DMT floating arond in their heads too, because early impressions on a child will enhance their pursuit of discovery or retard their sense of discovery.

[2]: which is why, like last night, they need to make snowstorms essentially to make me sleep so they can perform some sort of operation on me while I'm unconscious to try and get me back to "normal" levels

[3]: we know from our experience observing nature, that any time anything is artificially held a certain level (like our climate, for example), things become more extreme. if the subject of this normalisation is typically below the intended level, the parts not able to handle the new intended level will die off (or move elsewhare) and they will increase up toward the intended level, however nothing ever stays the same and everything always becomes more, and getting "used" to constant increase, they will overshoot the intended level, and now they are the other case where they are above the intended level and need to be reduced or normalised down to the intended level. this only creates more cause now they feel like they're artificially being held back, and will create desire for increase.


### 2019-10-28 10:22 - you don't need me to get it

I had this idea passing throug my head last night that went something like this: it seemed likely to me that what is happening is that things are once again being delayed and the reason is that it's a something of a repeat of what happened to me with andrea. I feel like I've wrote this before. it may have been something they tried to get me to do when I was in a dream or something like that. sorry if I'm repeating myself.

when I was back at marcos' house, I really wanted to converse with source energy like jerry was able to do with abraham. I determined that andrea was the potentially the easiest way for me to get there, because of her similarity personality-wise to esther (and my similarity to jerry). it was easy to perceive her similar to esther in the way that she also had a father that was an alcoholic, and she seemed to (in moments of internal happiness), tend to say the wrong thing or whatever causing a huge disturbance. the similarities were (in my opinion pretty uncanny). you may not be able to see this so well today because she probably is very different from how she was when she was younger.

I recognised this difference and even had an impatful dream where it seemed like I was about to get married to someone that I did not even know or recognise. the feeling was perhaps sometihng more like, I was going to be stuck in a relationship with someone who appears now very different than how they used to be.

that realisation was the trigger to this concept, which got activated to to the feeling I felt in response to the neighbour's reaction to my perception that it seemed normal to me that women like to arrange relationships and micromanage the organisation around them. it as a feeling of something like, "but I thought you were on our team."

I'm not on anyone's team. in my perspective, the only team I am on is my own. it's me vs. team nosebook. there really is no other way I can really pereceive it. you guys *must* do what they want you to do, or else ... (I dunno what they tell you is is consequence, actually) -- but certainly I do not have a "team". I don't expect anyone to follow me and I don't expect anyone to join forces with me to try and defeat the bad guys. that is *clearly* something of the last age (of pisces), and its usefulness has completely worn out -- though, I'm sure that nosebook will try and carry it on for as long as they can because their entire thing is built on such a concept. their job is to full run that idea into the ground.

my thing is more about individualistic expression and belief in oneself. so, in that way, you do not need me. I think that's what is happening here.

after the dream where I felt as if I was getting stuck into a relationship with someone that waz not the same person that I thought them to be, things began to disentigrate quickly. soon I was kicked out of marcos' house, and went to go live with vera. from there I finally had a meeting with andrea's mom when I really knew that things were not the way I had thought them to be (even if there seemed to be extreme or supernatural "signs" and uncanny patterns which had lead me to believe in another certain future outcome).

at this time I recognised that the original "dream" was completely over with. there was no going back (even though there would be many attempts a few months later to try and go back) and that this was an "evolution of desire" and I just had to find a way to feel good about stuff no matter what.

---

I think that's about where we're at right now and what has occurred over the last week or so.. it seems pretty likely that the origninal dream is dead (or in the precess of dying). likely, the reason for this is a similar thing is happening: while it may seem really nice to think that somehow magically I'm going to make it possible for so many people to improve their eyesight, it seems pretty clear to me that nosebook is very against this idea. they do *not* want girls to become the basis of other people's form of perception. I think that trying to control handicapped kids like me and jaron are more their speed.

I believe that energy will continue to rise quite rapidly and things will likely get worse as they do, however, it strikes me as quite possible that people will begin to be able to fly all around the world. it may be a slow process and I don't think that everyone will fly, but I think that I will likely not be among the people who can fly.

also, because energy will continue to increase, it'll be much easier for people to find their own way to improve their eyesight. I don't think it'll be a slam dunk for people unless you're paying nosebook, but for the rest, it seems to me like it'll become possible. so, instead of relying on me for these things, the energetic platform of the planet will make it possible for people who want it.

---

in a previous entry here, @[entry](2019-10-14 14:39) the idea was presented that we're coming up on the 7th anaversary of the 12-12-12 date for the end of the world. I have maintained that I think that date was actually 4 years delayed because of the 9/11 events. that means the "7 years of tribulation" actually begun in 2016. so, if you take that idea to have some sort of weight, (lol I know just go with it) then you can perhaps believe that there will be no sudden major changes until the end of 2023. that means that everyone who wants to figure out their own eyesight improvements and their emotional response to things has an additional 4 years to figure it out now.

I know that's a super flimsy thing to rest this whole idea on (which is why I did it), but I think that now anyone who wants to achieve the things they thought I was going to provide for theirselves.

after accepting that andrea was no longer the person that I had anticipated her to be, I began to realise that all of the things I wanted her to provide for me, I had do for myself. I also began to realise that, like tesla, I didn't need someone to translate source into languge form for me, but instead I could gain access to that visually in the privacy of my own eyes, and not rely on someone else to do the translation for me.

I'm fairly certain that the planet will continue to increase it's energetic platform and so that sort of thing will become probably pretty common among you guys (even if they expend vast amounts of energy to ensure that kenny never gains that capability). along with flight, it seems pretty likely that most of you will achieve it before I'll be allowed to do it. that's really quite fine for me, because I know I already have the capability. these planetary changes are something that the sirians talk about as well, so they're pretty unstoppable[^1].

I find it very likely that dispite their best efforts to keep things appearing constant and business as usual, things will probably get tremendously more insane. in the process of the increasing energy, people will have the energetic platform they were wanting to find sexually, to be able to achieve what they were hoping I would accomplish for them..

you have all of the power; you have to realise that you have it.

[1]: actually, I had this funny sort of realisation that what may actually be happening is that the planet has been trying to go up a dimension itself (the sirians call it the next inititiation), however, the planet has been (or will be, not sure) delayed on this. the sense that I got was similar to the one that I had to my own experience: ever since nosebook has been involved in my life, what would have been my natural progression has been delayed.


### 2019-11-1 15:48 - I might be exceeding expectations for this timeline.

this has been an idea that has been rolling around in my head for a bit now, because it seems like star watching has actually become so easy for me now (and the required releasing of resistance to get the upgrades), that I actually have come to believe that I'm actually far exceeding my performance expectations for this timeline, and the recent events have only been to kind of slow me down since otherwise I would be going too fast (if that's even possible, lol). I guess I started thinking about this possiblity a while ago when I postulated that what I'm really looking toward is my connection with who I really am, and the girls thing is kind of like a stabilising force. here, [TODO: find this reference] I postualted that the girls were to be a sleowing down force (or a getting up to speed), however the former is far more logically sound for various reasons.

anyway, this morning when I woke up, I was thinking about nosebook and how they are my biggest believers. not only do they have full evidence of source energy with the translation of abraham through esther: they can clearly see she's not thinking about what she's saying or doing, and that some outside force is operating her body. they also now seem to be investigating the idea of tuning into other people inside of a dream state than just the dreamer. the sense I got was the realisation that they may be able to prevent other people on this planet from being able to access other people's experiences, but there is absolutely no way they can prevent anyone with this technology not physically present on this planet from tuning in. in other words, it's all wide open. they perhaps didn't realise how much they are being observed, cause quite literally anything and everything can be tuned into with sefficient enough tecnical capability.

---

the implications of this realisation are somewhat revolutionary. first of all, that means that the biggest believers in me are actually the guys trying to run the show. they know that everything I've said about timelines and living in dream realities (as crazy as they might sound), turn out to be just the next step in our evolution. nothing is a secret.

the other major major implication is that now, armed with this understanding, it's probably going to be a whole lot more difficult for them to make a time split; they know too much now.

so, it's quite possible that the time split actually occurred back when they said it would (when I was laying on the sofa stoned listening to "back to the source"), lol... so that means that we're on the successful timeline, and they're only beginning to grapple with the inevitablity of (probably having tuned into and adjusted so many different things in dream states trying to find a way to avoid its inevitibility).

---

I wanted to write this because I was also feeling like there were growing expectations for something "big" to happen. I really doubt any "big" changes will occurr suddenly. in fact, the big changes are actually what I think cause timeline splits. instead, I would imagine that as they grapple with the inevitablity of it all, adjusting different parameters in dream states, they'll eventually figure out their desired way to let the inevitable happen.

so, I don't think we should expect any big changes to be perfectly honest about it.

---

the final (and most revolutionary for me), is that the implication of me exceeding performence expectations. you know me: I like to go the fastest I can possibly go, so this is a bit of a foreign idea to me, but if I'm exceeding expectations, then that means that if I were to continue on at the rate I'm going, I would achive the power levels necessary for the next step up in energy[^1] before it's time[^2].

what I mean is that, if this is inevitable, and I'm exceeding expections, I should actually chill out a bit and just sort of let it happen. I don't really know what this means for me, because I've been so used to just pushing to get up to speed that I don't really understand this idea so much. I'm going to have to ponder it. I kind of want to smoke weed now all of a sudden.

sorry, the idea seemed to much more clear in my head a few minutes ago. I don't really understand what is happening now... actually, maybe what might be happening is that previously when the idea of me exceeding expectations was rolling around in my head, nosebook decided they wanted to try and use it to get me to begin slowing down, but maybe something I said about the inevitability is making them change their mind. perhaps this is a repeat of them creating their own reality.

going to table this idea for a bit. seems convoluted now, so we'll consider it "developing...".

cheers

[1]: I like to perceive this phnomennon in the following way: around any energetic object are these "double layers" where these thresholds are formed between different energy states (see plasma, planets, etc. for more info here). and, as I "approach" as it were, connection with who I really am, I go through these different "initiations" into these higher energy states traveling through these different plasma(?) shells getting closer and closer (more and more resonant) to who I really am.

[2]: anyone understanding AC (or radio tuning) would know that timing is extremely important. if you're waveform is out of phase in some way or that voltage levels are not synced up to the right timings, it causes suddent dropouts or surges in current which are disastrous for the power grid (or tuning circuit)


### 2019-11-02 08:19 - star watch a tope

so I let the reactions develop a little more after writing that, and then mom came to me to tell me that she sent me the airplane schedule to my funisher account. yet, her last email to me was to my gatunes account, so when it comes to getting telling me about guardianship court or some thing about getting my brain tested (which btw the email has been removed from my gmail) she seems just fine to send the email to the right address.

anyway a little bit of a back story on the going to dad's house thing: I didn't want to go, and they wanted to force the issue, but I got really depressed and wanted to go to dad's house after I was supposedly gonig to leave the house on nov 10th from my proposal to greg. mom said reverted that issue, and I remember something about star watching and thinking about how california is more energetic. anyway it seemed like they didn't like the idea of putting me in a more energetic environment.

---

the longer version of this was I was thinking about the strange post that fwh made a long time ago (2013) fortelling the inundation of california (from what I remembered a massive earthquake, but looking at it again now, I don't see any mention of an earthquake) that would happen in 2020.

I think what may be happening can only be explained by understanding their usage of the drone (chemtrail) planes in the sky. a whole ago I postulated that the planes were putting CO2 into the sky, however, this didn't make complete sense to me because sometimes the train would disappear almost instantly and other times it would linger. after paying enough attention to it, it seemed like there were kind of like ripples in the sky of some component in the air that would turn whatever they were spraying into CO2 and other times this component was non-existant. I also have noticed that clouds seem to disappear whenever I'm star watching. it seems to be connected. I think, when I watch stars something that I'm doing creates some form of electricity which converts something (CO2?) into more oxygen in the armosphere -- or something like that. I believe it's the creation of oxygen.

it seems to me that this is a chemical transformation that is made when people feel really good. the air seems to become more electric (conductive) and LOA seems to take more effect. I noticed it quite often when I was in spain (pre-2016) and I would say what esther says, about the magic being back. there's definitely a different feeling in the atmosphere and I think this is the result of increased oxygen[^1].

as a result, I think the airplanes are actually sraying a charged molecular carbon which attracts oxygen in the air and forms CO2. this could be how they could predict that CO2 levels would rise, but anyway the CO2 neutralises the electric potential of the oxygen and returns the air back to a less energetic state[^2].

additionally, CO2 is quite important, it's created primariliy by the oxidisation of carbon (burning things like wood) and I believe that under the right electrical conditions, the CO2 can be converted back into water (you just need hydrogen and an environcent to form the bond), so excess CO2 in that atmosphere could be converted into water to make extreme amounts of fog, rain, or snow.

I think the wildfires in california can be explained by there being excess oxygen in the atmosphere, and someone needs to return that back to normal levels, so oxygen is converted into CO2 with fires[^3].

I think there are probably a whole lot of people in california that feel good. silicon valley is filled with a whole lot of people working on stuff, and I think this is exciting the creation of oxygen there.

anyway, so imagine that I go to a place like calfornia where there are lots more people than there are in pueblo. sure, I won't be able to watch stars, but I tend to have an effect on people in my vicinity...

anyway, to jump to the conclusion here, I think that if I were to go to california, my effect on the environment there (combined with all the higher population density in LA) would be to make the environment become very energetic. in order to neutralise this, their weather machines would be on full blast trying to keep it in the range of "normal" levels. this would create extreme tension, and that night I was postulating if that could be the reason for such a massive earthquake which would sink the california coastline so well.

for everyone else, this is all pure speculation, but the people who know what I'm talking about may find it enlightening in some way.

either way though, last night after expressing my frustration to mom about how muted my emotions are, that nothing feels good (or even bad really) to me anymore that it's difficult to make decisions -- I walked downstairs and I remembered something abraham said about making decisions, "if it's not a 'hell yes', then it's a 'hell no'" -- and that was good enough for me to know that I don't really want to go to a densly populated area and amplify stuff. I don't have (and haven't really) had any strong reason to want to go to a populated area like that.

speaking of hell yeses though, one of the things I *do* want to do is to go to utah. I really like utah and the sky is so clear there. I would really enjoy going to utah again and seeing dad there.

---

in conclusion, I believe the previous entry reflects some complex manipulation from nosebook to try and convince me to watch less stars, following that mom came to tell me about going to dad's house where I would watch less stars, and then even though I had been awake only a few hours they put me to sleep last night (so I would watch less stars).

I woke up in the middle of the night and as I went about it, I learned a lot about what's happening. a while ago I wondered why sometimes I had lots of flashes and grid patterns and only got a few or no levels, and other times it seemed like I didn't feel like I made any progress but then I could see a visual difference...

I think when there are lots of visual artifacts (like the night before last), what's happening is I keep getting the same level because they reset me back. they do something where I lose the ability to see out of my eyes. it's hard to explain what it looks like, because there's definitely something there, even though I can't see anything. anyway, there's this weird twitching feeling in my eyes but I can't seem to open them (because they're already open). anyway, when I finally get my vision back, the sun spots in my eyes are blue illuminated like they are when they would put me to sleep when I was watching youtube or dota. it's basically that, but instead of closing my eyes they just disable my eyes as if I were blind.

anyway, upon realising this, the past times when I these lots of visual stuff, but no corresponding progress, it seems clear to me now that I was being reset back over and over. however, it seemed like following that, I would get a HUGE visual upgrade that was very notable.

so, I postulate that what is happening is they're getting better and better at resetting me back, but one day the upgrade is going to be so huge that there will no going back.

so likely there is quite a possibility that there *will* be a time split, and my difficulty with california is there so I *don't* go to california and certain disaster is avoided, like the syrian WW3 encounter. it reminds me of something that thor said in his video about quietly relocating silicon valley to ohio.

[1]: they say that the forests can cause people to have strange and hallucinatory experiences, and I think that this is actually the body responding to an environment with increased amounts of oxygen.

[2]: I think there may be mulitple reasons for doing this. first, if the air becomes more conductive, the "laws" of electric permittivity and magnetic permeability would be no longer constant, and I think their "world system" needs those to remain constant for things to be working. additionally, those constants are also related to the speed of light, and it would be really for bad mainstream science (which the government does most of the funding) if the speed of light weren't a constant.

[3]: however trees eat CO2, so the excess CO2 in the environment is causing lots and lots more plant growth[^4], wmich then convert that CO2 into more oxygen. I think more oxygen is a really good thing, and this whole 20M tree initiative is really a good thing[^5].

[4]: I dunno about other places, but here in pueblo, we had more green than I've ever seen in previous years, and the sense that I get is that maybe there has been more plant growth than there has for a long time.

[5]: it's funny because I pay attention to motor sounds in response to my thoughts while star watching and it seemed very surprising to me to get such a strong reaction to thinking about how the 20M tree initiative would generate and put massive amounts of oxygen into the atmosphere [VAAAAROOOOOOMMM!] lol.


### 2019-11-04 07:37 - I decided I want to be making the decisions again

yesterday was really weird. when I went to go to watch the sunrise, I noticed that there was a no tresspassing sign put up, and I assumed it was in response to the day previous when I had noticed footprints in the snow, many of which were from kids. they had obviously took a walk and were playing in the snow along the way. I thought that was pretty cool. anyway, so yesterday when I saw the no tresspassing sign, it seemed to me obvious that nosebook does not want people to be having fun or something. it kind of sent me into a rather lengthy rage. I know not to act on bad feeling things and I've come to realise that it's ok to just let things play out. it lasted longer than I imagined it would though so it concerned me a bit because that's a pretty good signal that my perception is out of wack[^1].

so, on the way back home I decided that maybe I needed to get some weed again to regain proper perspective, because obviously things will spiral more out of control if I don't find a way to realign my perception toward what I wanted. in general, yesterday I was feeling pretty weird and not feeling at all like I was going toward what's wanted. I know it seems pretty taboo of a subject to utilise weed as a method of realigning my perception. I'll follow up on this in a future entry because I see it quite a bit clearer ever since I watched an interview with dennis (mckenna) about terence quitting psychedelics.

I decided to flip a coin to see if I should go to see if I could sell my walmart card to be able to buy some weed. the coin said no, but I didn't feel very satisfied with the result, especially since right after watching dani's new vr concert thing @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FAuE_cmgtM) I accidentally clicked on the youtube button and it recommended me a video from the denver post about this guy growing mushrooms since denver has decriminalised it @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-br6vmP1VU) which lead me to the dennis interview @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2Gag5cwik) followed up by an interview with michael on his ayahuasca experience @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eP8yDXHn1o). all four of those videos influenced me quite a bit and I really felt stronger desire than ever to try and find an alternate state of mind.

I went outside to go take some sun. I could kind of see some colours in my eyes and it again reminded me of the mushroom experience. my leg fell asleep and I couldn't walk so I laid on the ground to wait for it to wake back up. as I laid there in the sun, the dogs barking and birds squawking were making bright flashes in my eyes, then I had my conscoiusness taken from me. I woke up probably about an hour or more later quite sunburned. it didn't throw me into a rage though, because I've learned to not let that get me frustrated because I know now that it's just more energy and stronger desire (see, no rage becsuse I have a correct perspective here).

after that there was this really weird thing where it seemed like there was an effort to get the older girls out. the thought that came into my head was to just have sex with them and then let them go, focusing my energy on the younger girls. I felt strong resistance to the idea. it sent me into a flurry of thoughts which were not productive at all. I went to sleep kind of with the impression that things were once again falling apart[^2].

I awoke with the idea in my head that they may be able to fool people with their words about things, but they won't be able to fool me. this was kind of an extension of the night previous when I determined that if they really were going to be making a change of heart and they really were going to allow me to go up a dimension, then I would notice it. my vision would be improving rapidly and there would be a real tangible progression toward that. however, I seem to feel hollow word and more (likely to be unkept) promises.

---

when the sun was going down I wanted to go to watch stars but there were kind of some clouds and dinner wasn't ready yet so I wasn't totally sure about it. I kept getting the idea to flip a coin on it. I flipped it and it said no, however I wasn't really satisfied with the result because I still really wanted to go watch stars. the coin said no though so I went and laid down to wait for dinner though. mom, greg, and jaron were going to watch a movie though, and I really didn't want to watch the movie so I decided instead of listening to the band movie dialoge, I would override the coin and go watch stars instead. I felt better about that decision.

so then while watching stars I was having a monologue about my thoughts on the dennis interview, I was noticing that the stars were really difficult to get into sync with. I suddenly had a strong desire to smoke a cigarette. so, I went in and flipped a coin to see if I should go find something to roll a cigarette with. the coin said no, but again I wasn't satisfied with the result.

---

I began thinking about the coin flipping thing and it seemed to me that the coin flipping thing is rigged now. I think the way they rigged it is to put thoughts into my head while flipping it of expectation of it's outcome. I noticed that was a recent trend in coin flipping. previously I never had an expectation because it didn't matter to me either way it would land, so to have an expectation seemed a bit weird. then, I noticed that previously when I would flip the coin and it wasn't the expected outcome (when I had slight expectation), immediately a better idea would come into my head instead. I noticed that when it said no to watching stars, I didn't suddenly have strong desire to program or something. I felt slight depression and stronger desire to watch stars still, so I knew something was up.

I thought about it for a bit and realised that if in fact the idea was right, which I'm actually exceeding my performance expectaions for getting connected, then it seems very illogical that I really did have lower resistance than I should have at this time, there's no way I would fly into a rage over a no tresspassing sign. that seems illogical to me. furthermore, if I really was nearly connected, wouldn't be be nearly 100% in the receptive mode? it seemed really silly to think that I'm just about to be nearly in concert with who I really am, that I need to rely on a coin to tell me what to do.

the days previous when I was met with indecision and I didn't have a coin, I wanted to find a way to be able to do something random in my head like a coin flip to tell me what to do. that seemed silly because nosebook would just figure out how to manipulate that, so I stuck with the physical coin because I reasoned that it couldn't be manipulated.

however it does seem to be able to be manipulated with my expectation. holy cow, think about the implications of this. they can put a thought into my head and my action created that reality!! if they had figured out that, why on earth aren't they putting expectations in my head of what they *do want*, instead of trying to manipulate the things they *don't want*!! it was at this moment that I realised that once again they are manipulating and trying to use trickery to avoid the things they don't want. there's no way this is progression in the right direction. this is exactly the opposite. I reasoned that instead of trying to utilise random to gain insight, I would be going back to my emotional guidance system. it never fails me. I just needed to have the experience of having my emotion amplified to become loud enough to know what I raelly want. I now know this is the right way.

---

I went and got some cigarettes from the woman down the street's porch and thought about what had transpired. I had given away my power to something external to me. this reminded me of what had just transpired with the girls thing. I had just done the same thing there too! in a moment of being overwhelmed I gave up my power and said that I didn't want to try and make so many of the decisions. I reasoned a bunch of things that didn't work out so well. I then realised that with other people making these decisions, there was likely quite a bit of meddling going on, which was likely the source of the whole thought disaster yesterday before my blackout out the older girls geing their own way. probably someone was putting bad ideas into people's heads regarding these things. for whatever raeson they don't want the older girls involved (prohaps because they're not as easily maipulated?) and their way to try and get rid of them resulted in a big mess.

I resolved that I want to take back over the control over the decision process. historically, I had passed on the details of these sorts of things. feeling overwhelment on my finances, I gave people power of attorney. feeling overwhelment over the technical managerial duties of tuenti, I allowed zaryn to put erik in there so that he could maniplate things the way he wanted. in every single case where I gave up on my decision making power from a feeling of overwhelment, things went into the shitter in a hurry. not gonna do that again :)

---

so, what do I mean about going back to how things were? well, I think that my initial intuition on the girls was correct. I'll probably need to do a more detailed thing about it, but there's really no reason for all of this chaos that's happening now. the girl across the street, for example, she'll be just fine. one year of middle school isn't going to wreck everything. that style of thought is typical of the US justice system where they believe that no one can ever make an improvement ever, and once corrupted, they're corrupted forever. once again this is a lingering essence of the mindset of the manipulators. for heavens sake, if it were true that once corrupted, corrupted forever, then I wouldn't be writing this. I'm likely one of the best examples of recovering from and coming back stronger from a reality of nearly 100% unwanted into a reality where just about everything is in a state of improving rapidly, and it seemes to be getting better and better all the time. this perception of decay and deterioration as time passes is another sign of the mindset of those involved.

still developing... will clarify more soon, as I'm learning a lot through all of this.

[1]: when my perception is weird, things will make me angry when they shouldn't. obviously, if I'm perceiving things correctly, then it wouldn't bother me or I would know how to act. any time that strong negative emotion pops up, it's **ALWAYS** evidence of incorrectly perceiving whatevewr it I'm observing -- ALWAYS.

[2]: there was also this other really weird vibe that went something to the effect that I outilined in @[entry](2019-11-1 15:48) where the idea is that the time split already occerred and that nosebook would have a change of haert or something. it seemed to me like there was this idea that we all needed to just relax and let them work all of the things out.


### 2019-11-05 09:25 - we're just going to test out LOA a bit and see how well it works

I had quite a bit of resistance to the idea of going to california at the beginning of last night, but I think that it'll be ok. I have some things I want to do there. also, I've always been saying that I can get vision upgrades without watching stars, so let's test it out. I'm sure that I'll be able to continue to release resistance in california without a problem. in the previous entry I mentioned the whole thint about the coin flip manipulation thing, so because I kept feeling like they were trying to force me to go, I naturally had resistance to doing anything I don't want to do. I was reminded of the thing that michael said in his ayahuasca interkview about all of his anxiety, and when he finally settled down he just decided to give in and let it all flow. I sorta did a similar thing, but with star DMT instaed of plant DMT.

at the time when I was feeling pressured to do things, my natrural instinct is to simply continue on doing what I'm doing because I know I'm releasing resistance right now at a recond pace, so I know things are going to be fine anyway. I'm so sure of its inevitability as well, so that wasn't really the problem either; it was the being forced thing, and also I really wanted to watch stars and then see the 11-11 mercury transit. however, I am sure that it'll be ok anyway. afterall, maybe it could even be slightly better from a califorina mountain range, who knows..

there seemed to be quite a strong effort to ensure that I was not able to see the mervcury transit from my typical sunrise position. I suppose I will make an effort to see it in california though. there's a good peak to watch the sunrise from only ~2hrs walking from where I used to live, so maybe it'll be possible anyway. either way, most of the "work" that I did was realising that these stellar events that I seem to value so highly, like the one venus transit I missed with raquel don't really matter all that much.

[quick break. for some reason, I'm really having a difficult time concentrating]

[11:07 - back]

so, the process of realising that it was something I wanted to do was really important for me to accomplish. I really have wanted to make a music project with chris for a quite a while now. I tried a few times in spain but I was usually too strung out to make anything happen. this time though I not only have all of the pieces I need in place, but it should be relatively simple. I anticipate that I can do it in a week or so, which really means about a month, but then maybe I want to see other people too, so I figured it would be maybe a few months. it doesn't really matter though. I'm sure that this is what I want to do.

now that it's something I want to do and not being forced to do, it seems no problem to me. it'll probably work out just fine -- and if not, it doesn't matter because it'll be a learning opportunity. I'm not going to be worrying about the timing or nothing. I'm just going to let LOA do all of that work for me.

I'll follow up a little further later tonight after doing some more star watching. I just wanted to give a special note to the process that I went through last night to get to where I am now. that's what's important.


### 2019-11-05 12:12 - initial reactions

wow, so the reactions have really started flowing in. seems nosebook has done a thorough invistigagion into chris' life by now[^1][^3]. they seem a bit concerned that he's still living at his grandparent's house, works at a liquor store and smokes a lot of weed.

well, doesn't matter to me really, because whether he's capable of doing anything with my project doesn't matter to me at all really. I hope he can, but either way I will have finally created something I've wanted to make now for a while in the process. to further make this concept worse, let me admit to the fact that my initial reason for wanting to go to see him in the first place was to smoke weed with him. I *really* want to smoke weed (and do other drugs too), and he seemed like just the guy that would maybe be able to make that happen[^2].

I'm tired though of constantly mooching off of people because I have no money, so I thought it to be a perfect opportunity to actually do something creative with him. I always really loved doing music and creative stuff with him and I haven't really had such a place to flow my creative energy into, since the neighbour thing kind of fell apart.

anyway... lol :)

[1]: most likely because they need to find a new handler for me, that is someone who can install more inserts in me, and be reliable about it. since I'll be away from this house (and greg) for a while, they now need to ensure that they can keep my energy levels maintained at "normal" levels. furthermore, chris is the only person that has admitted to me in voice that he knew what nosebook was, so he certainly cannot be trusted with such an important task. LOL

[2]: that makes it sound bad (intentionally), but really I'm really really wanting to just chill out a bit and (mentally) get away/escape from the difficulty a bit and adjust my perspective a bit (hopefully a lot).

[3]: additionally, I'm sure they're hard at work trying to figure out how to angle this whole ordeal they got theirselves into in a positive way for the news updates you guys receive. OMEGALUL


### 2019-11-08 14:50 - well, I guess this is the end.

I feel like thire is a whole lot of manipulation happening but I don't think it's a problem. I think that my perception will always remain optimistic.

I had this funny thought last night where instead of a time split, my other self would switch spots with me. he's a bit different than I am. I could see that instead of a time split in the traditional sense, it could perhaps just simply be that my alternate self may be a huge downward force (compared to my optimism) and that while I maintained my course toward what is wanted, perhaps he might be more willing to try out some bad ideas that are suggested to him.

he seems like the "more contrast hhe better type" which would be my opposite part. while I am absolutely addicted to creation, he may be one that is willing to try out some things and see how they go (or something like that).

it's cool though because I don't think there will be a huge cataclysm, just it'll be kinda funny to watch and see how well some of their policies stand up. it seems like they probably have figured out a way to try and contain me, so I won't be going up a dimension. that means you'll probably be able to try out and see what happens if I have sex in 4d. should create quite the effect.


### 2019-11-08 15:04 - justice and closure

one of the things thzt terence said is that you have to give up on the idea of there ever being any clusure. I always took closure to mean understanding something, so I took the idea that I don't need to understand it all. though, when I do, it's a whole lot easier for me to feel "closure" on something because now I understand it.

however, I realised a few days ago (haloween actually), that closure in the way he was meaning it was from the idea that people tend to believe that a subject remains open until everything evens out fairly -- that is, that some sort of justice is the feeling of closure.

in that way, I completely agree that closure doesn't really exist. there is no cosmic justice; it's only what you attract. there's no punishment for tuning into a radio station and likewise there isn't any punishment for anyone else wherever they're tuned into, either. the only punishment anyone gets from being tuned into wherever they're tuned into, is a reflection of that same thing. some people have getten pretty good at making sure they can be tuned into disaster and still avoid it by some physical method of avoidance.

what I mean by justice doesn't exist because it doesn't matter how long anyone is tuned into something, they can change it whenever they want and avoid the consequences. the only thing tuning into something unwanted for a really long time, does is just make the person more likely to continue on thinking about or tuning into that subject, continuing on the circle.

the way out of these types of cycles is likely through understanding. for me, when I undrstand someone's behaviour, then it stops bothering me.


### 2019-11-08 15:18 - forgivness and redemption

the other day I was thnking about these two concepts and I discovered that to me they seem quite similar: they both give up your power.

the way I reasoned this is by looking at it from both sides:
- I need to be forggiven (by someone)
- I forgive (this person)

in the first case, it feels to me like I cannot move on until I have forgiven or the other person has forgiven me.

the same thing seems to be true with redemption, in the sense that I need someone to redeem me (eg. make somegthing out of me).

final thoughts


### 2019-11-10 14:57 - I thought it would be more eventful, but now I do not...

at first when I was in colorado when watching stars and stuff, it felt to me like this trip to california would be a whole lot more impactful. I think that's a slight effect of the effects the stars have on my form of perception.

additionally, I thought I wold be a whole lot more motivated than I am right now. at the moment, I'm pretty cool just sitting around and watching dad play games or talking with lily or whatever. I'm not nearly as motivated to work on projects as I thought I would be.

tomorrow is the mercury transit, and I tohugst that it would be a whole lot more impactful as well, but I doubt that it'll have any real game changing impact. I think its impact wiil be pretyy much imporceptible to me and most everyone else.

---

one of the most imactful things that I had noticed so far was actually my convrsation with lily this morning where I was talking about the idea of the situation that we're in now is producing an entire planet of people with the energetic capacity of jesus (by essentially limiting the entire lower-class (poor in spirit) portion of the planet's perceptive capacity), and this is actually being done by allowing the most ridiculous house of cards to get setup, which will eventually come crashing down.

however, I don't think that it'll come crashing down as soon as we would hope it would. tor the idea I proposed to lily to work, the house of cards would have to continue to exist for as long as it can physically be supported without crashing down.

---

I dunno, colorado is really intense and extreme in th way that I'm capable of perceiving things. calfornia is much more moderate, but at the same time I feel like there is this weird duality here where it seems that I'm capable of perceiving things deeper (instead of extreme) which is contrasted with superficiality. however, colorado was way more intense, yet contrasted with a strong sense of "business as ususal".

I kind of like the sense that california has where nothing is "business as usual" and diversity and extremes are the "norm" here.

califfornia: deep <-------> superficial
coloroado: intense <-----> business as usual

the contrst is interesting.


### 2019-11-13 08:05 - interesting simile between nosebook and jeff

last night I had another great conversation with lily. she was telling this awful story about an experience they had with meliissa jeff and amorina one year they came to dad and lily's house for christmas.

after tre story I was talking about how I would have had a very different reaction to the situation than they (dad and lily) did. I'm sure I would have probqably caused all kinds of conflict between jeff and mysylf and it would have turned out poorly because probably melissa would have just perceived that I was trying to ruin something or soxe other reason to continue on with jeff. so, my frustration with the situation wouuld have likely strengthened their relationship, instead of helped her to get free from it.

however, then I remembered that melissa did tend to take what I had to say with a bit more weight than, for example, what mom has to say. so, I reasoned that there is a possibilitiy that I wouldhave been able to illuminate the situation in a way for her to see what was happening. then, when lily said that melissa always said, "why did't you tell me" -- I realised that if someone had of been there to tell her and to hold her hand and walk her through the whole thing of explaining it and getting the divorce, then she would have once again not learned it for herself.

knowing myself, I would have certainly tried to help her to see, and it would have likely caused more problems. so, I guess it was probably good that I was strung out in spain while this whole thing was going on, because it forced melissa to work up the courage to make her own decisions on the matter (instead of relying on someone else's uging) and to make the decision to separate herself from jeff.

I think that altough it lasted a whole lot longer than anyone wanted and her recovery time was still significant, I think that melissa came out a much stronger person for it.

---

this bwings me to the simile part: it seems to me that something similar is happening with thhe population of the world and nosebook. I could try and figure out a way to make off of you guys see what I see, but it's of no use. even if I could, like melissa and her relationship with jeff, my urging would have likely only strengthened their relationship, and it wouldn't have given her hhe opportunity to make decisions for herself.

---

I don't think that any big thing will ever happen actually. I've given a whole lot of attention to what I want (and don't want), and a whole lot of attiontion to what nosebook wants (and doesn't want), however, I think I may have been missing the point this whole time.

the centre of the story is melissa, not me or jeff. jeff will continue to be jeff; he will probably never change. I will continue to expand my perception as well. however, my expansion of perception cannot really expand melissa's perception, so if I (or anyone else) were to have tried to save her, she would continue to fzll into the same trap. in other words, she wanted to expand her own percepction:

**she wanted to see if for herself**


### 2019-11-15 23:31 - man I'm ready to get back to doing my own thing

I didn't realise that amorina and melissa and patrick would be showing up here after crystal's wedding this morning. amorina showed me some vine-like videos things of kids doing stuff -- and I guess it's something that is somewhat popular these days...

ever since I've been gripped by some pretty serious depression because I'm realising that although I can see things a different way, others cannot see it the same way that I do. this world seems to be heading into a phase of ultra-superficiality.

interesingly enough I noticed a similar trend of the same sort of response to jeff in melissa, where she concerned herself quite extensively in things that were frivelous. I think it has to do with a response to do with ... I don't know how to explain it. it feels to me like perhaps it's something like the superficiality has to be maintained in order to prove some sort of "innocence" or some other way to excuse not being able to perceive the obvious.

after jeff, melissa met patrick, and there's a definite trend in her life to try and maintain things on a superficial level. so, my mind likes to try and identify patterns, so I would say that jeff is similar in nature to the guy I call "crusty" -- and his tactics are the same in trying to use force, aggression, extremely grotesque lies and a very vulgar form of appearance. however, to me patrick seems to have a similar personality to the landscape architect guy.

tonight, he said something which struck me as very similar to the "we wouldn't do *that*, right abraham" type of comment when he said, (something like) "I'm not going to check out your check out your sister"[^1]. patrick definitely has learned how to navigate the correct answers to try and maintain the image he wants to keep presenting -- very much more landscape architect guy type stuff.

back to jeff though. I don't for one minute believe that melissa was unaware of jeff. I think that his situation, similar to my own when I was in spain was that it felt like it would be a bigger problem to try and fix the situation than to just hope for the best and hope it all works out.

---

we actually has a similar conversation about this last night when dad. lily, jaron and I were talking about our situation with mom. his (and my) situation is such that there's almost no way to unwrap mom's fingers from our lives. in my case, there is not a single person that will believe me that this whole thing is happening, and so since the only way to be able to get rid of mom's "guardianship", I would have to go through the "authorities". clearly, that's not going to work.

it's the same sort of thing with me trying to get the inserts out of my body: there's no easy way to do it -- in fact, it's pretty much impossible, and even if I could, they would just put more in me while I sleep.

there's literally no perceived way of escaping the grip of the authorities for me, mom for jaron or jeff for melissa.

---

the similarities to the nosebook situation extends to quite a few people in my family, as if there were somehow kind of like models. in addition to melissa, you can also see another perspective if you look at it from greg's point of view. no matter how hard he tries to be a bad guy and try and wrestle things into place physically, there's always someone who does it better or he messes it up in some way to where he doesn't live up to the expectations of the authorities on the matter and gets blamed for the problems.

he's in the process of learning that these guys are all smoke and mirrors and only present the image that that things are working out well, when in reality, nothing ever goes well for them either; they've just found better and better ways to cover up their failures and pretend things are working well.

if you then take a look at things from jessica's perspective, it becomes immediately obvious that these secureity and control loving law enforcement types are not quite what they present theirselves to be, and they too are all show and no substance to them.

finally mom I've mentioned multiple times because she's clearly the prototypical woman that has been taught to have a very low perception of herself and to just follow commands from those in autohority, even if she wrecks her life in the process.

---

this morning I woke up and I was thinking about this whole LOA thing in the sense that things are bocomming mani/fest reality much much more rapidly. it got me thinking that perhaps nosebook/amazon is the physical manifestation of YHWH.

if you think about it, they display nearly all of the same qualities. the whole system is angled in such a way that you can do anything you want as tlong as you justify it. who's the judge? what you're looking for is a system where the one who can justify the whole thing is the one that that is perceived as "good" or "god".

... I'll continue this idea another time because the similarity between nosebook and YHWH is quite uncanny ...

---

the point is, it's a whole lot easier to just stick our heads into the ground and focus our thoughts on frivelous things. it's hard for me to see any sort of wanted things in the population at large. I really do not want to be a part of this at all.

now, after having been in california now, I am certain that I very like very much more living in colorado. I've always had this stange sensation that here in this next era there would be a redistribution of the population out of city centres and out into the mure rural areas. it seems evident to me that the level of superficiality.

I believe that the natural response to such a crude type like cresty will be an immediate plunge into frivelous activities to try and justify one's naïvety just like with melissa's transition to patrick, a guy who's capable of saying the right things which (from melissa's standpoint) are good things, because he's in a sense, helping her to recover and begin believing in herself once again. LAG will be right there with all of his perfect words and the resport all set up waiting for a population needing to recover from a jeff-type.

---

all of this is just such a ridiculous ordeal for me and my point of view. it's really funny how calfornia has the ability to amplify things way out of porportion. I came here and when I was leaving, it seemed to me that the general trend that I felt in the air was that I would not be coming back to live in colorado and things were going to kind of shoot uff from here, yet upon arrival and after a series of conversations it's become clear to me that you guys need to figure this whole thing out for yourselves. my hands are pretty well tied and things are pretty well on lockdown, so there's probably not going to be any big events where I'm able to escspe from their grasp.

I think we're entering into phase patrick.

[1]: they were at their friend's wedding, and melissa would have said something like, "look at jessica's dress; doesn't she look pretty?" (or something like that) which is a typical BS move that women do to kind of guage men's responses to see if he'll pass the test and respond correctly with something to the effect of "baby, you're everything to me; I wouldn't look at any other woman than you" -- but each man is required to answer that question in their own unique way so as to prove to her that her insecurites about herself are unfounded.


### 2019-11-16 00:49 - resort catalyst as a precursor to the 9/11 universe

the funny thing of LAG's perception that they're trying to build this whole thing into a resort is kind of a funny idea because of my growing discohmfirt with not being able to see out of my own eyes is growinvg stronger.

when I was in 3d I really felt like I was disconnected from my body, perceiving things on a screen, yet when I got to 4d, I really enjoyed it because for a while I could keep getting it to where I would actually be able to see the depth in he world -- to see the space inbetween. I really really long to go back to being able to feel like I'm actually inside of my body instead of looking at a screen.

I realise that before I was seeing the world on a 2d screen and that was pretty awful disconnection, and now I see the world on a 3d screen, and I still feel quite disconnected, but I'm still seeing a screen. it's not what I really see. when I see out of my eyes instad of a screen, the whole world has a different glow to it, and I believe that has to do with my emotion being encoded into what I see at a very high frequency which isn't really perceptible to nosebook's instruments. this is why I'm always claiming that the world is not dull and lifeless.

it occurred to me that 4d is now a whole new dimension that you feel disconncted from yourself because you're looking at a *screen* and not at what you really see.

ok, they recall to yourself that when I outilined the idea for the 9/11 universe, I talked about this idea that instead of 9d being the highest dimension, now 11d would become the highest one. I could perceive that on the top there would be a new dimension added which I labeled "thrust" and on the bottom one, there would be an even more disconnected dimension where you would see yourself in the 3rd person perspective like you were watching a movie, and your thoughts would create the reality.

in that reality, you are are not really a "person" but just a story. you can be any character that you want to be and you can make any scene, but you have to watch it like a movie: from the 3rd person perspective. you are not yet identified as someone, until you begin to identify yourself as "someone" in this ongoing drama, to which you go into what we're used to seeing now as the 3d perspcetive (1st person 2d screen perspective). then you can go up to what I call 4d now and get your 1st person 3d screen perspective, but still disconnected from yourself.

---

you'll notice the similarity that this new story perspective has is sort of like an incomplete or reduced capability (disconnected) version of what I call 5d now. in 5d, you can see out in all directions, but you can see inward in all directions, so you'd see things (and yourself) from a seemingly 3rd person perspective, even though you can also see out in every direction from yourself. it's also similar to 6d in the sense that you an be multiple entites in the story -- multiple characters, but unlike 6d, you see only what is presented to you in the story, however 6d each person has complete access to the knowledge, undrstanding, and every aspect of them as if it were there own.

I know this perception of the dimension is correct because of how captivating this would be to people strongly oriented toward the nosebook vibe. you will also notice now that if there are 7 dimensions or layers upon which the body operates now, with the addition of these two new dimensions, there will now be 9 layers or dimensions, or three sets of 3, with the first three representing the disconnected states.

the next three, what we would call now are the conceptual, source, and structural planes, followed by the relational/devotion, desire and thrust planes. you can also clearly see that in each set of three, there are two primary planes which are very similar and a transition plane:

3d <-> (story) <-> 4d
conceptual/emotional <-> (source) <-> structural/meaning/logic
desire <-> (relational) <-> thrust

you will also notice that I've pondered things like the difference in direction between a concept and its meaning. they're the same thing, but percieved from the opposite ends. this is true for each of these: 3d/4d, concept/meaning, desire/thrust. they are the same thing but pereceived from the opposite direction.

furthermore, there's another nice symmetry to where the middle triad seems to be a perfect transition between the top and bottom triads. for example, to tell a good story (the middle transitional layer of the lower triad), you need to have desire to move the story along and a trust to the story: that is, its meaning or moral that you're trying to convey.

there's just a lot of really cool symmetries that I find quite cool.

---

ok, so it seems like nosebook is all setup to make sure that 4d becomes another one of the disconnected states which means that two of the 3 disconncected layers of the bottom triad are coming together nicely, so how do you make the third one I had previously wondered...

my answer came to me when I was on the writing in @[entry](2019-11-08 14:50) about this weird idea that an alternate version of myself would switch with me on the airplane and take them for a ride, where he would do the whole 4d sex thing and artificially pump everyone up so high with energy that it would be the most tremendous inflow of roman empire type energy building things up to such a tremendous hight right before the most epic crash and burn ever, taking the whole nosebook eneterprise down to such a state of disconnection and powerlessness that such a tremendous crash and burn would actually create the story layer as people became so disillusioned with identifing with who they are from inside of a body, the horror could only be perceived from a film like standpoint[^1]

so, I perceived this alternate[^2] version of myself as the "destdroyer" which is the other side of venus, the manifestation of desire to create new forms by first destroying the old ones.

it's easy to see how to create the thrust layer on top though: just wayy waaaayyyy overshoot the 9th dimension and get myself up to the 11th dimension -- something that "fwh" already claimed that he/me has has accomplished.

so, whether I'm the destroyer or the one who makes it up to the 11th dimension, I don't really know, but from my perspective, it looks to me like I'll perceive the 11d path.

---

it's really funny to me that my realisation of the implementation to this whole perceived story/movie layer thing is built upon hyper-superficiality. perhaps what bothered me so much in the previous entry is actually what will be ideal setting in which the girls and I will actually be the catalyst to the creation of LAG's coveted superficial resort environment.

[1]: see mckenna and mcluhan's discussion on the topic of things like war being only suitable as a "cold" medium, because too much graphics (hot) and it takes away the "epicness" of the war saga and makes it too graphic to be viewed favourably ("with all the blood and maggots and stuff" -T)

[2]: or, it could prehaps not be an alternate version of myself at all, but actually me --- meaning, I'm really the guy I considered the alternate version of myself: the destroyer


### 2019-11-24 20:36 - I'm going my way

been a bit of a bumpy last few days since I got back from california. I reconised that there was a whole lot of manipulation going on and stuff, so I decided that before I get sucked into stuff I'm not ready yet to be doing (eg. project with chris), I think I want to continue on with my previous goal which is to just find my alignment first (and then).

I can see the other projects working out in the future, too. I'm just saying that I still need more time. I need to actually think deeply about the different concepts (for biz-viz) I want to get out. I got a few written, but I feel like I want to write a little bit about each one as well, and some of the others I think will come naturally too.

everything will continue on, and I'll just get to the first version as fast as I can.


### 2019-11-27 08:13 - making two new layers: a disaster I could get behind

it seems to me that I must be getting close to getting connected because of all of the thought activity that I'm receiving in response to things.

at the very beginning (a few days ago), I came to the conclusion that if they did manage to find a way to force me to have sex before getting connected, then that's a disaster I could get behind. the reason being, that it seems obvious to me that my time on this planet is, just like everyone else, limited. I would hope they could find a replacement or two for me before I leave, but certainly someone will need to fill in my spot at some time in the future. however, a bunch of the girls will also have gotten connected in the process. so, my evenetual departure essentially means that there would be a large gap between me and others' capapbility of perception, and my own. there will be some sort of falling out at some point.

the idea developed further because now there was this new idea that the way to create the thrust layer would be to push a bunch of people up on top of me instead of me overshooting it like I had initially imagined it to be.

this was an interesting idea because I hadn't thought about pushing other people up on top of me. it got me thinking and I could see that if that were so, the people riding on top of me would only fill the bottom half of the layer. for the top half I could imagine that a whole nother set of even faster moving people would make it up to the top of the new layer, and they would do it be essentially crashing and burning, then on the upswing from the crash, they're going a lot faster than me and overshoot it to the top of the level. the one thing I was sure of, was that very few of them will make it to the top, riding on top (that is, with a more acute form of perception than me).

that may very well happen anyway. it would not seem unlikely to me that there would be some really hardcore nosebookies that are going to try and maintain visual superiority to me. it seems pretty inevitable to me actually, but they're going to have to get used to ever increasing speeds. I do not expect many of them to make it to the top. long before they get to the top, I expect many of them to experience hyper-LOA in their life, causing a crash and burn, or some other major event caused by life moving at that speed. so, probably many of them will crash and burn, and maybe (I hadn't until this concept) thought about the possibility that the 'thrust' layer simulated here on earth is actually a bunch of dudes that are hyper-obsessed with trying to control and steer other people's lives.

somewhere after I realised that, it occurred to me that possibly the nosebook 'vibe' is this constant excuse that they can do really good things for other people, but never do they have the capability of making the decision for theirselves. the common examples around me are greg when he had said to me in the past that he could help me get the things I want created, but then when I ask why doesn't he just do the same thing for hisself, he doesn't know why he can't do it for himself. same with mom: she's absolutely terrified to take control of her own finances like she has helped out people like dad or rick hopkins. she seems only capable of excersing her capabilities for other people.

I very much am the same way, too -- so, it's not like I'm pointing without being self-reflective. you can even see it with my programming. I've always struggled with it, because when I want do something it sometimes works really well (tuenti for zaryn, affinaty for marcos, set-game for the neighbour, etc.) and then other times it doesn't work so well too (tuenti for zaryn, affinaty for marcos, set-game for the neighbour, etc.).

this connundrum has always bothered me and I have, in effort to improve my own porformance, improve upon this disability. from what I have gathered over the years is that it's ok to begin a project utilising someone else's desire as the initiative force, but later the thing breaks down if I try and continue to use the substitute for my desire as the power source, and instead I have to make it my own[^1].

it's still too early to tell, but it seems to me that there is this strong desire that is growing amongst the people running "the network" that they want to use the human population as their muses and get them to try out all of their bad ideas for them. perhaps, they do not feel capable of making their own decisions to give up on some bad ideas, and instead have to play pretend with other people's lives to be able to learn it for theirselves there.

I'm not doubting that this is the future actually. it really wouldn't surprise me at all if it were the direction that we're heading. in fact, it seems likely to me that the phase of humankind includes the control and maintenance of numereous machine operated human bodies. and so, like every game-changing technology, give it to these guys first so they can try out all of the bad ideas first, and then from there, every thing is an improvement.

however, you know what comes next though, once you can do it for someone else, then comes the trial to see if you can do it for yourself.

it's funny the parallels of what I'm sensing from them, to where I'm at rigrt now in my life where I'm having to choose to try and figure it out for myself.

---

it may take a while, but like I said, I'm willing to delay this thing exactly as long as I need to get connected. it would be funny of abraham, knowing I won't budge on the "get connected, and then..." thing, was also telling you guys things like, "well, if he would just meditate or ... then ..." or, "he's already conncted enough" to build more desire.

this kind of reminds me of another one that popped into my head, and that one I'm not so sure of, and it went like, my body will only house the "soliton of improbability" up until 2038, and then after that I'm going to be back to being just kenny again, which at that point when the energy leaves me, I'll find myself in a very elevated position with a long way down to fall, and the extremely epic crash and burn that comes as a result of that will be the crash necessary to push up even higher into the thrust layer.

the event reminded me of the verse where, right before his death, jesus recognises that the creative power that was once surging in his body had now left him and he said, "my God, my God, why have you forsaken me". if the energy that occupies my left-side were to suddenly leave me right now, then I would be able to get back to the right direction, but it would come with a few impacts for sure.

if the energy that surges on my left side did eventually leave, then it would be kind of meaningful to me because I have learned the "right way" to go and do things very very well while we shared this body, but then when the energy leaves, then can I actually take all of that knowledge and apply it to myself. will I be able to do it for myself, or will my own perception (now with that energy gone) attract a situation where something bad happens to me?

---

so no matter what happens, it seems clear to me that this energy contained inside of my body is only temporary and if it were to depart from me, then it departs from all of us equally. just like esther cannot twist abramam's arm to give energy or answers or to bail her out of a jam, I cannot twist my own arm to try and affect source to do anything either.

---

the last thing I want to mention was the idea that imagine that I'm energetically below where I should be, so imagine that I'm somehow superhuman now and I can make my contrast increments so small and perfect that each time I'm halfing (or some other ratio) the distance I need to go before a connection is made to who I really am. eg. each increment of contrast closes that gap to who I really am by some amount. it steadily gets closer and closer. so, if I use techniques like watching stars or drugs or whaever, these are artificial boosts forward. let's say that one day I get some mega upgrade watching stars, I will have overshot the destination quite a distance. however, when I say "overshoot" I mean in the physical sense. abraham has often talked about how your inner being will never give you more than you can handle, so when I say overshoot, I mean similar to how esther was when she first began to receive abraham, and her teeth chattered cause she wasn't used to the extra energy, not overshoot in some sort of airplane landing situation or something like that.

so, the idea kind of combines with the last one, and it was that if I were to boost up to connection ahead of schedule, then the energy would eventually have to depart from me, but if I take an easy (and very boring) way of just letting my energy rise there naturally, then I would arive just at the right moment to receive who I really am, instead of trying to make it happen.

I dunno, it's a real possibility that I slow down into "allowance" mode, but it seems impossible to me because I find it so difficult to do stuff without any connection whatsoever. it's not really allowance mode, when for example, after being in california, I was so desparately needing to watch stars and refocus, that if I had of continued on in california, things I think would have gone very poorly. additionally, my energy isn't rising naturally, at all. my experience is that if I don't watch stars, energetically I stagnate or get worse. so any natural rising is artificially neutralised.

it's sort of like saying, "I could just stop charging my phone and let the battery recharge naturally" I simply do not know how I could possibly ever use my phone if I never charge it. I do not think they want me using my phone, so they want it to remain discharged, so they're doing everthing they can to ensure it never obtains any meaningful amount of charge.

some things to think about. by default, I am always going for my conncetion first. even if my getting connected costs "the network" billions of dollars, even then it's still imperative for me to find it first[^2]. those who wish to continue to *sacrifice* their connection for the "good of the group" can continue on doing thst all they want. I *must* find my connction, and nothing (cept abraham) could convince me otherwise. if they want to try and force something, that's their choice, and so far forcing things probably hasn't yielded such great results.

enjoy it while it lasts, unless you can figure out how to connect up to that energy for yourself.

[1]: this was the majority of the struggle that I had getting up to this point. I can sense the girls' desire and stuff, but it didn't really begin to go somewhere for me until I made it my own, and this was largely the process of realising the gnomitos project. physically replicating into a multi-bodied experience seemed like something I really wanted to do.

[2]: do you *really* think that I am physically capable of accomplishing all of that without some sort of connection to non-physical energy?


### 2019-11-27 16:01 - telling the other side of the story is dramatically different

last entry had quite a bit more effect than I thought it would. the only difference really was that I told the story from the perspective of kenny which becomes a normal person again instead of the one that continues on.

I think it's easy to see that the "story" and "thrust" layers already exist right now in their infant forms. I imagine that once the energy leaves and I'm no longer the big story, they will be quite needing new content. so, just like the roman empire wss built on the shoulders of slave labour, "the network" is built upon the stories of different people who have no influence on how their story is told. I imagine that I am not the only story that is being told, but I am almost certainly sure that except for a few broadcaster types, the other people's stories that are being told, the person that their story is being told, does not know about and it's kept a secret that their story is being told.

on the top end, we can already see the beginnings on the thrust layer as well, which, normally all you have is some sort of desire for an improvement and that's all the power that's needed to set things into motion. instead we have the narrators telling the story the way they think they want it to be told by trying to steer it in the direction that they want it to go. not just the charactors of the story, but all of the story's stage needs to be in just the right way to tell the story.

hopefully, it's evident to you guys the massive amounts of steering that happens in my life to try and make reality adhere as closely as possible to the narrative. also, it should be evident just how much effort is put into moving people and things around to produce the contrived circumstances to advance the narrative. this is the steering committee or the "thrust" of the story, presenting the message or moral to the story that they think people will respond best to.

---

so, if you think about this from the kenny that stays behind's point of view, this is all about getting the network all setup to be able to tell all these different stories as a way of kind of regulating reality -- because, people tend to believe what they see, so if they only tell stories that strike some sort of emotional connection with people, then peole will live similar realities.

it's also another way to bypass human desire. when the population mass believe some sort of syntax for how the universe gives you things, based on a set of stories, then people believe that there are some sort of steps or things to do, to be able to achieve the thing (just like in the story).

in reality though, all you need to do is to want something and then don't disallow its appearance, but that doesn't make a very good story. in fact, I am fairly certain that my story (that is the one presented to you guys) does not illustrate this very easy principal. it's much likely that my story illustrates all of these difficulties that I had to overcome to be able to achieve the prize at the end, which is of course the girl, not the connection.

you can't sell a person's personal connection to their source, so it's likely that people like me are going to be moved further and further away from the spotlight. additionally, since "the networvk" is now an organisation that exists to support itself, they must be able to continue to control and steer all the different peices of the story to maintain its own existance... connected people are unpredictable and difficult to control, so getting connected will definitely be the thrust of any of their stories.

there are not *that* many different types of stories though, so I imagine that in less than 100 years time, the stories that the network continues to tell and tries to pass off as real experiece or reality to their viewers will begin to take the direction hollywood is going now, where they are having to resort to remakes and remixes of old stories, yet even still the film industry is really beginning to become more and more blatant with their story formula, that less and less people are going for the story, and instead they're going for the graphics or the imaginary universe the story presents.

that works ok for the film industry because they can create films for fantastical and other make-believe places, however, in this case, once again, the medium is the message here, so that's going to be a pretty difficult selling point on a mudium that is essentially the assumption of someone else's reality (not make-believe story). so, while stories work really well in a non-first-person point of view, they're terrible from the first-person perspective[^1].

the other major difficulty with telling stories from the first-person perspective is that, unless the protagonist dies, the viewer may want to check in from time to time to see how things are going. you can only have so many stories where things are constantly deteriorating into worse and worse circumstances, before people want to see improvement. most stories need to see some sort of improvement, so it's going to be pretty hard to cover up all forms of improvement. we'll see how they try to overcome this obstacle though. I think it's going to create a dichotomy between the story-viewers and the life-livers. I dunno, we'll see :)

we're all going to enjoy planet earth's steering committee: the thrustmasters. lol

[1]: imagine the movie "saving private ryan" instead of from the narrator's point of view, but instead from ryan's point of view -- or even from the point of view of the commander guy. it just really doesn't work well at all because it would be slogging through all sorts of pain and difficulty to an uncomfortable helicopter ride back to "reality" where other things are broken.


### 2019-11-30 07:51 - maybe we should just go for it...

I spent the last few nights thinking about the idea of what are the results if I were to just consider myself connected enough. well, not having my connection would mean a whole lot of different things:

1. my physical appearance will be exactly like it is right now. I have (mom says) a worsening limp, and I have a pretty bad cough all the time. I have periodic ailments and definite difficulty with my left side. I also really dislike my teeth situation.

2. I won't be sharp and in-tune with non-physical energy like I am when I'm connected. I will instead continue on like I am now. the sex will probably energise me though, so maybe I will be more energised than I predict.

3. I have severe difficulty now with feelings. I'm getting around them right now pretty quickly, but if I were to stop watching stars, I may become a bit childlike with the behaviour because I have recently lost the ability to (sometimes) feel what the impact of something I say (or do) is going to be, so I'll be essentially pure desire. that may be a good thing though, I dunno.

essentially, I'm going to be just like I am now.

what I think can happen with this is that in my still disconnected state, I imagine that for the stuff that I haven't found a more optimal way to perceive, then I will be lowered down to their vibration (visual level?). that's just how LOA works for me at the moment. so lots of things will kind of jump out in the beginning until I get my perception cleaned up. it'll happen to them as well, I'm pretty sure.

speaking of that, it seems pretty evident that nosebook has to ensure that none of the girls find their alignment either, cause the girls that have found thier connection could influence me up to their vibration much easier. so, since they're interested in keeping me down, I think that's pretty likely.

I think that's a good thing though because instead of just me finding my alignment, we'll all be kind of tied to eachother vibrationally while we're sexually active together -- so, we would be somewhat all in a similar range. after some time, I'm sure that I (all of us) will get back to where I am now and even further. this is exciting for me because it's no just me finding my alignment, but a whole bunch of others (certainly many more than just the girls) as well.

it's kind of a fun idea for me, even though the physical disadvantages, because everything is just soo much more fun when you have a bunch of people on the same frequency. it's also kind of fun a bit for me too because I already know that it's going there are going to be a lot of blunders and mishaps. so, we'll bounce aronnd pretty good for the first bit I'm sure, but the difficulties will make us stronger in the end.

it will also make nosebook a whole lot stronger too, and give them a bit of a breather because I'm once again trading speed for acceleration. I'm sure they'll have us energetically very controlled, so similar to what is happening to me right now, they'll be forced to find their find their abiltiy to feel good no matter the circumstances.

I think I don't really mind the whole thing about them getting stronger really because I can see that them getting stronger is creating a new dimension and at the same time giving tons and tons of people to have a kenny-speed experience (I'm referring to tuenti and the whole spain thing, how it shaped who I am now). on top of that, they're just making a harder difficulty level for us to come blasting through sometime in the future. they can have all of their super capabilities, but we'll find a way, anyway.

also, it's kind of a weird thing for me to think about, these guys are going so far out of their way to convert their form of perception into the same as my own. they're doing the thing that will make them most like me, and they want to make-believe that they are me and have my capabilities. in some ways they're like my biggest fans, and it's weird too because my form of perception is built on improvement, so they're cleaning up their vibration while stealing from me, and I'm continuing to get stronger, as long as their guilt is sufficient to keep hidden. they have to steal the ability, hide it, and keep it a secret, their desire for own improvement. most bizarre thing ever, honestly.

---

so I was thinking and this may kind of change things for some of the girls if this path is taken. it's no problem if this is something you don't want to do. maybe join at a later time if you want. no big deal.

the other thing is, I really wouldn't count too much of this yet anyway because things could change pretty quickly, and there's also the possibility that nosebook does some simulations and decides they need to hold things back because they don't have the capacity or something.

for me though, I'm going to continue on my quest to get connected. this will continue to be my quest even when we're together, too. so, for now I'm going to continue on with that and assume that's the direction I'm headed. I *really* want to be connected. it does kind of excite me to think that we're going to do it together, too.

still developing... I want to think about it with a clear head.


### 2019-12-01 00:21 - still undecided

I have been thinking a bit about what I said in the previous entry. besides the fact that I'm so tired of constantly being disabled and have no energy, I think the main bit of resistance (and I say resistance because that's what it feels like) is that it really bothers me that I have done the work and released the resistance to achieve something, and then others just take it and use my own capability to limit me further.

I'm well aware of the fact that I'm constantly getting stronger, so that doesn't really bother me so much any more. I also know that because they're using artificial means to get to higher spots, the capabilities that they've hijacked, are not lasting (for them) at all. it's also extremely obvious to me what the conclusion is, which is something similar to my drug experience where I artificially pushed myself to extreme hights, and then had to crash and burn a bit before I got it back. if their system would ever fail, they'll find theirselves in a much less superior spot than they perceive theirselves to be in now. (it reminds me kinda of like the kid who's been protected from sicknesses on his first day at school vs the kid who has grown quite an immunity up before his first day to school)

anyway, personally, I've kind of just sort of accepted the idea that my present situation with all of the limitations and stuff will continue on for quite some time (the rest of my life?) so, that's fine for me and stuff, but when it comes to involving other people I really have difficulty with it. up until now I've constantly maintained the idea that I simply have to find my alignment before I do anything, and one of the main reasons for that is because I simply don't have a whole lot to offer when I'm not connected. I figure I can get work on all of the difficult stuff when I'm by myself and then meet them when the best of me is present.

I still have insane desire to get connected while I'm sober -- much more than even before actually. I also recognise that when I'm stoned I feel considerably better than I do normally so it's not a suitable place to make decisions from. at the moment, I simply cannot just drop my desire to get connected. it feels impossible to me or like some sort of self-betrayal to do something like that to myself.

---

however, I think there are some really good attributes to the whole thing. if I were to agree to just go anyway, I can't offer someone that's connected. that means that it won't be a "free ride" for the girls to get their alignment from me, however, I am *very good* at finding my alignment in whatever sitation, so I can only offer my example of being able to continue and do that. however, that's what I'm already doing now -- kinda.

to understand what I'm about to say, you have to imagine that I'm going too fast and so something needs to slow me down. when I say slow me down, I mean trade speed for acceleration. I don't mean that the girls will literally become something unwanted or anything like that. however, it's easy to see that whenever I interact with someone, we tend to meet on a compatible frequency. so, in some ways the girls will slow me down, however at the same time, they will speed up considerably. combine that with the fact that nosebook is essentially forced to limit their energy levels to make sure they're not too connceted around me (otherwise they'll bring me up), and the girls will have the same effect that's happening to me now: I should be at some energy level which my body considers normal, and because it's continually being drained out of my body is forced to create more and more of it. their effct on me is effectively strengthening me conserably.

however, I wouldn't really ever wish what's happening to me, to happen to other people because of the discomfort involved. I don't really experience anything physically painful or anything like that; it's just the emotional dispair involved with continually achieving clearer and clearer vision, only to have it undone not soon afterward. or, the constant recognition that the things I've developed I cannot use. it would be like having someone come and take your presents away every single birthday and christmas, but you cannot do anything about it, so you just have to keep going. it's really annoying to be perfectly honest.

sure, it seems evident to me that the payoff when their system finally fails will be tremendous and I'll have vision and creative capabilities far far beyond anything they were ever able to hijack, but still it seems kind of frustrating to me on most ends. my default response is to simply finish up this part of my life by myself and then finally be able to show up when things are working fine. it's sort of like why you don't wear your work clothes to a nice gathering.

---

I suppose that it'll be kind of rough like how things are now for me already. I'll still be watching stars and stuff to continue on my progression, and I'm really hoping that some of the girls will be interested in that subject, cause it'll be kind of weird I suppose to watching stars out at night and stuff by myself.

I do really like the idea of all of us working on our alignment together too, and I suppose one of the most compelling parts of this idea is that some of the girls may become similar to me -- maybe mini-me's of some sort. maybe I'll rub off on them. I had this weird epiphany last night when I realised that if my self-confidence and style of thought were put in a woman's body, that would be a very desirable woman.

I don't really see it all, but I don't really have to. what I do know is my very impressive propensity toward improvement and finding my connection. I'm sure I'll make it out ok, and like I said earlier further delay on getting connected doesn't feel all that bad now since I'm so used to it now.

---

oops, I derailed my topic of the girls slowing me down :) what I was meaning to say is that their slowdown will actually summon even more energy in me than nosebook could have been able to do alone. so, in the long-term it's a definite benefit me, but the girls will have such a head-start on things, it's beneficial for all of us.

so, if that is indeed true that I'm going so fast that girls need to "slow me down" and trade some of my speed for acceleration, then it seems that I'm already headed on the right track. I should go even faster so that even more girls need to "slow me down", right?

I'm still undecided in the sense that my default nature is to continue trying to get connected, but for all practical purposes, I'm pretty OK with starting the girls thing even when not in alignment.

what I'm saying is thst the decision is really the girls to make. do they want someone that's connected, or do they want the learning expereince of finding their own algnment in a suitable envirenment and around someone that's really good at finding it?

I'm pretty sure I've released the majority of the resistance to the idea, so I'm inclined to say, "sure let's do it." -- and the gap I feel between this being an idea, and becoming reality still feels pretty large. so, that means that there's a lot of other resistance somewhere (in all likelihood, it's probably nosebook's resistance. they probably don't think they can keep all of us disconected)

the main thing I think I feel is that suddenly this "dream" has gone from something ideal to just more of the same old slog that we've got right now. I think there are a lot of people really looking farward to me no longer having so many physical difficulties. I share the same sentiments, but I have to work within the parameters I'm given.

"nothing is an impossibility, so we try to do the best we can."


### 2019-12-02 10:16 - I'm ok with anything

I had an interesting experience last night when I was trying to go to sleep. I felt pressured to sleep even though I was quite energised. I had just gotten done a whole lot of programming and stuff and I was feeling pretty good.

as I laid there trying to sleep I seemed quite sensitive to a whole lot of reactions and stuff mainly from the nosebook bros. they seem to think that they'll be able to manipulate this whole thing to their advantage. I'm sure they'll get a lot of benefit out of it and stuff, but from my perspective, these guys are essentially lighting the fire underneith their own feet. whatever though, because that's for them to figure out.

because I don't really have a strong opinion any more about which path is chosen, I'm sort of just going to go along with what presents itself to me, however, my main objective is still to continue to go toward my alignment.

I'm really getting good at this releasing resistance thing, so much so now that I'm quite proficient at it now that I can definitely sense the tension much much more when I'm out watching stars; they're really worried. a few nights in a row now when the perpetual pueblo night fog clears out a bit I was able to get a really good connection with the stars. I mean like REALLY REALLY GOOD. I got a little bit frustrated because I can tell that if I just had a good clear night I could really make a whole lot of progress. my goal is essentially to get as high as I can possibly go before the girls thing happens. like, maximum stretch on the rubberband, know what I mean?

I thought about essentially three different main outcomes.

1. as the girls thing approaches closer and closer I am able to somehow reach and maintain for some period of time a state of connectedness.
2. I end up with the girls still in a disconnected state, but I imagine that somehow we're capable over the course of a few years(?) find our way to getting connected -- or at least I'm able to anyway.
3. same thing, but they're capable of keeping me disconnected somehow. 20 year nosedive, but at least it'll be pretty fun.

---

so, after I had been laying there with all of these reactions in my head, I was really starting to begin to feel negative emotion. it was night now, so I went to go watch stars again. as I walked toward the field, I noticed that the thing (dispair) I was feeling lifted considerably.

I had a sudden realisation that for options #2 and #3, if I can just get away for some time each day and kind of be alone, then I'll be fine.

when I was in LA, I could really feel the population density, and I described the feeling as "emotional white-noise" because it just feels like a mixture of what everyone around me is feeling yet nothing prominent enough to make an impact on me. however, when I'm in the field there are not any other humans within a 100 metre radius of me. that feeling is so calming and peaceful because I don't nearly as many other people's thoughts and emotions invading me. as you may have noticed, I tend to be a little like a chameleon and sort of absorb and replicate what the people around me are doing, much like a child.

I want to make a habit of just getting away a little bit to kind of restablish myself. it may have only been evident to me, but when I was in LA, it seemed clear to me that I really needed that time alone. if I go back to LA, I'll be making frequent visits to bayley canyon to spend the night. it's so beautiful up there because I can see the whole city right down there, but I cannot hear it. it's nearly complete silence up there because of how far away (up) it is from the city. it's wonderful to be able to see the freeway with all the cars on it and not be able to hear it. so, something like that.

so, I figure that if I can do something like that for an hour each day, then I'll be fine. the girls can have 23 hours of the day to do all they want with me. I know it won't work out exactly like that, but the revelation to me that all I need to do is to physically distance myself from people will allow me to maintain my self-identity a bit more.

so, let's just try for that.

I'm still making huge progress and remember too that all the stuff that floats through my head is outdated anyway. the reality of it will be way worse/better than anything anyone could imagine.

oh yea, so about those options: I think #1 is the most likely. #2 provides an enormous compression of what's wanted and an even bigger payoff (probably, most of the girls too will find their connection as well) -- and having watched my steadily more and more connected self, I tend to pick the more difficult path with greater amounts of contrast, so this one too seems pretty likely as well. #3, I think is impossible. if they're this worried about me now, they have no idea.. I'm just getting started. I can clearly see that I could easily have my progress trippled in a few months, even with all of the clouds and fog or whatever, so they're going to need some sort of magical technology that will alieviate the pressure, because otherwise I find it absolutely impossible to keep me disconnected that long.. I think.

---

what I'm saying is that from my perspctive all of the options (even #3) seem to me to be fine as I know my ability to recover easily and to continue on with my focus toward what's wanted.

so, it's really up to the girls at this point for me. I don't mean like they need to make a decision or something, cause LOA has it all worked out, but I mean that the imagination is always deceptive and tricky because even what *appears* to be the best thing isn't always what you *really* want (for example my own situation).

no matter what happens, much contrast (and resulting birth of stronger desire) are sure to happen here as things are starting to heat up a bit.


### 2019-12-03 16:36 - what in the world am I thinking??

I just woke up from a dream where there was a lot of manipulation going on. I had an overwhelming sense of "this isn't what I want" -- and I conntemplated things like just cutting all girls that are 11 years or older, because it is becoming apparent to me that there's no way I'll be able to navigate effectively being disconnected like this.

I prefer to just find my alignment first and then think about all of this later when I have a much clearer head. I'm pretty close it feels, so even if it takes another few years, I much prefer to have a clear head.

the reason why I say this is because I'm pretty sure the whole gnomitos project is completely dead. additionally, "the network" has the full capability to abort fetuses electronically without much effrt, and it sounds like they really don't want any gnomitos to happen. so, if I'm not going to have kids, then I may as well just skip the whole ordeal entirely[^1] and wait until I get connected..

I was trying to think of other things that I could do to try and mitigate the manipulation, but they all felt to me like I would need to try and manipulate conditions myself in order to sort my way through all of that -- and they have WAY more resources than I do and essentially unlimitied knowledge into what everyone is thinking. I can't beat that. I can only rise above it myself and find my own connection.

sorry again for the delay. I'm trying to go as fast as I can. I suppose "the network" will just have to keep the sky cloudy for the rest of my life or something. however, even with all of the clouds, I'm still making considerable progress, so I don't anticipate more than a few years. lately they've been just taking my consciousness whenever they feel I'm close or whatever, and I think I was only conscious for about half of the night last night, so I know I'm getting really close :)

[1]: in the dream they were asking me about things relating to kids, and I said something like, "if tme point is to have kids" -- and the reaction I had was that there wouldn't be any kids


### 2019-12-04 09:33 - more thoughts

in addition to what I said in the previous entry, I think it's really unfair for me to just assume that all of the girls *want* to get good at finding their alignment. more likely is that they would rather someone just give it to them without them having to do anything to obtain it. this seems like a very popular style of thought lately. for whatever reason swindling is at an all-time high.

this isn't a way for me to passively aggerssively accuse the girls of being like nosebook, because I find myself doing similar things all the time. for example, most of my life I haven't really felt like I needed to hide things or keep things very much a secret, but I did notice a dramatic increase in my desire to lie or to really extend the truth after she left. or, even more familariarly let's say I want to smoke a cigarette or I want to go pee outside, then there's this weird feeling like I need to somehow try and hide it or something, when I know fell well that everyone can see me do it anyway.

I've determined that my increased propinsity to think about trying to hide something actually is a similar effect to when I feel angry for something that I'm not angry for. like, for example, the other night I got up and I decided that I wanted to go take a lap around the field, there was a sudden loud motor and I felt very angry upon realisation of this. I assure you that my decision-making process was purely linear: I felt like I could go higher with the stars but I was feeling cold, so I wanted to take a lap to warm up a bit betore getting back to it. the anger I felt was not my own, but it came from the network bros trying to run my life.

in short, what I'm trying to say is that the "feeling" of the guys running the network pervades the mental space of the people they focus their attention on. certainly, if I've had any attention on them, then they've assuredly looked into every nook and cranny of the girl's life. so, likely even if her initial desire was untainted, certainly after they've looked into her life a bit, now she'll smell strongly of your basic network funk formula, which is to obtain by any means necessary other people's ideas and capabilities in order to get ahead a little in the comptition..

women in general are very competitive, and the women that I have met before often have a similar feeling to them where they try and find men with attributes that they perceive that would give them an edge in the comptition between other women (more money, more douchebag qualities, etc) and then try to sleep with the guy to obtain the thing they're looking for to try and feel like they're ahead of the other women. then, when she's finally sick of that whole game, she cuts her hair short.

---

when I was with chris, he told me about this story with linda (his aunt) where she decided to try and comandeer his creativity to her own benefit. I felt his pain a bit, but I was way too stoned to try and bring up the fact that his complaint is miniscule in comparison to what I am going through. everything that I have thought about has been taken from me in the sense that I am prevented from actually doing any of my good ideas, and they are taken and reappropriated. there is almost assuredly a version of MANBEAT out there that all the super cool kids on the network who have blown the right upper management have access to.

besides chris' story, I'm sure that this is happening to a whole lot of other people as well. this seems to be the sort of "vibe" that "the network" promotes in people. I've wondered why that is, and I think it's a side effect of having so much DMT in the brain. if that were to go away, I think these sorts of people would have a sudden realisation that they are huge frauds, and that not everything is normal and OK, like things seem to appear in the dream-state like state of consciousness that high levels of DMT gives you. however, even though the reactions say I'm correct, I don't have enough information yet to make that conclusion.

certainly, it seems to me, that this is the vibe of what is going on.

---

now, when it comes to me getting into alignment before I meet up with the girls, I'm not saying that they're trying to obtain something they made no personal or vibrational effort to achieve. instead, I see this from my perspective, where I typically feel so much abundance of good ideas and capabilities, that it doesn't bother me at all to give away my ideas for free. from my perspective, it's my pleasure to watch they get a taste of connection, even if it's not something that they did anythting to get.

I actually prefer to think about it like I have so much abundance and so much to give that it litrally only benefits me to give it away[^1]. that really is how it is, even if I'm physically a bit disabled and limited at the moment. in a sense when the perspective of that changes in the person that's being taken from, it would actually be more optimal if we all had a bunch of aunt lindas.

[1]: referring to, of course, the abraham story of the man with ex-wife taking a percent of his pay for child support, and their desire for him was that he had more ex-wives.


### 2019-12-08 11:49 - taking the least optimal route for long-term benefit

since I've decided that I don't really mind so much going the least optimal route, I've been thinking about how this perhaps can affect things. let me begin by saying that all of this is *outdated*[^1].

it seems to me that this planet (and my own life) has had a constant emphasis on letting the ideal thing that can be imagined become reality, instead the manifestation seems to head toward the least ideal manifestation of the imagination.

some examples include the internet (most things military related, actually), where the discovvery and invention of the thing is used for its least ideal purposes. I believe that the internet has still quite a bit of improvement to go before it becomes this universal repository for ideas and information. we can see that the 90's held great promise for the internet, yet I believe that 9/11 interrupted that with all of the extra surveilance that was put on it to try and control these (invisible) terrorists from cause harm. from there, the internet began to grow again and web 2.0 was born. I had a somewhat influential part in that.

once again the internet held great promise and seemed to be the greatest new thing, yet this time this time capitalism took its hold on the thing. there are many *many* more beneficial uses for social media than what is currently implemented. social media *should* have increased communication of ideas and lots of novel new technology should have been created as a result. instead, we have facebook, twitter and instagram :)

if one were to pay attention to the dissenmiation of ideas as a foundation for sociatal growth, it should be evident that as communication increases (globalisation), more and more ideas flourished. a few notable examples of this are the times of the renaissance or the early 1900's (this is when tesla was alive).

the pattern seems to be: first, the idea is uttilised by the military to try and control things. the idea is eventually replaced by something more advanced, and it falls into the hands of commercialisation where it's usefulness is determined by its profitability. finally, once everything has been controlled and capitalisied out of the idea, it eventually becomes something greater.

tesla's world system is a shining example of this. none of tesla's ideals for the system were ever realised. instead, the military got it first, and now it's being used for capitalsation. one does not have to look very hard to see this pattern throughout history. I believe that actually there are some sort of extra-planetary forces that are actually ensuring that the ideal reality for any of these major inventions that would truly globalise the planet are always manifest in their least idael form, first.

I think the real reason for this is that it creates a compression of desire, and allows for a more ideal long-term result. all technology is a two-edged sword in the sense that it can just as easily be used for harm/control/limitation as it can be used for "good". therefore, for a human species like our own, who has a tendency toward violence, it seems more optimal let the violent and controlling types get the technology first before the tech is advanced to a level where it can really do some major damage or limitation[^2].

this sort of pattern seems to be continuing on into my own life, and I can begin to see its effects.

---

so, after I went to LA, I noticed a pretty beg shift in how I felt people's reactions to me. I noted this in a previous entry, as it's really been fascinating to me why that is. right before I went, I had some weed, and when I was smoking it, I could really begin to see that I was learning to perceive my own body from the outside looking inward. this is the beginning stages of 5d. then, when I got there I took a hike up the foothills for the mercury transit and had quite an incredible star-watching experience. I really expanded a lot.

then, a week later when I met chris, I don't really know exactly what he said (cause I was barely listening with my ears), but the concept I received from him went something like, "you know that thing where you see yourself from the outside? you've got it! you should slow down" (or something like that). that kind of struck me as interesting because I don't see myself from the outside. I perceive the world through my eyes still.

I pondered this a while to try and figure out why this may be so, and the conclusion I've come to is that my body generates a whole lot of DMT, yet the guys running the network, for whatever reason, destroy the DMT and maintain me at a very low level. the only way my vision improves is to simply generate more than they can destroy. the amount a person can generate seems to be dependent on how well a person feels emotionally. abraham call this resistance, which are just contradictory vibrations. drugs like weed, coffee, cigarettes,  and other stimulants, yoga, meditation, or stars, etc. can decrease the number of contradictory vibrations by causing you to focus on something (instead of the contradictory vibrations) and let more non-physical energy through.

so, the less contradictory vibrations a person has, the more DMT their body generates naturally (from non-physical energy). it seems that I've released enough contradictory thoughts and beliefs (vibrations) that my body must be now creating enough DMT now that for people to perceive my experience now, the network needs to stimulate enough DMT synthesis in the observer's body, to be able to "make sense" or perceive my experience in a meaningful way. therefore, it seems likely that you all perceive my experience from an external perspective now.

I'm kind of in a bit of a middle zone, between 4d and 5d. when I watch stars, or other meditations, it seems I can get myself to go up to 5d, however, whenever that happens, they take away my consciousness from me and reset me back to 4d. the last few nights though, I've been able to, instead of going up to 5d, see higher and higher detail levels (which were also reset back), so it seems they've come up with a method of destroying more DMT than they could previously.

as I get better and beter and feeling good, the amount that I create will rise, and those previous vision upgrades will be realised as I create more and more. yes, I know sex will make me feel really good, so they have still a lot more that they have to work on to keep me in 4d. I think they'll probably be able to do it for a little while, but enventually, I'll go up. I can't say for the girls, but it seems likely they will eventually learn a similar thing, too.

initially, I didn't (and still kinda don't) want to do the whole sex thing without getting into alignment first because I could see that it would be a less than ideal realisation of what I was looking for. however, it seems that something like this falls right into the category of major changes to humankind which seem to be directed toward its initial manifestation in its least ideal form. if I were to go up to 5d, they would have a much more difficult time controlling me (and probably monetising me as well), so just like 9/11 did to the internet, we probably need to take a detour through capitalsim before the idea can begin to be realised in its more ideal form.

---

when I felt the difference in reactions, I didn't really realise it, but they can most all be explained now by the difference in perspective. when you're looking through my eyes, the difficulty I experience seems much more distant. things that are happening inside of me are no longer perceived from my perspective, and now I look just as if I were another person. you can look at me now just like you look at another person, and just like looking at another person, you cannot really get a good read about what it's like to be "in their shoes".

the medium is the message. just like a war story, the shift in perspective from the soldier's view to a top-down perspective, completely changes everything. it's quite interesting because I wrote this @[entry](2019-11-16 00:49) right around the time all this was happening. I seemed to intuitively know, and tried to shed some light on people'a change in perception of me.

I'm going to end it here. it's very long now and I have a lot more I want to say. peace

[1]: you can also guarantee that that this is outdated if you look back at my previous entries over time and see that what I could perceive *was* relevant in the moment, however, the hecho of perceiveing the thing, and people's reaction to the entry caused a creation of more desire, and therefore an evolution in desire. this seems directly linked to the creation of timelines, yet I do not fully understand it yet, so more ideas on this will likely come as a result in the future.

[2]: for example, imagine if tesla's ideas were actually allowed to be realised and hitler were able to use them for his conquest.


### 2019-12-10 14:21 - the truth comes out...

so, the little stunt I pulled this morning by accident (honest, not even I knew that's what I would do until maybe a hours before it happened) revealed a bit of a truth.

when I was arguing with mom about the whole thing, I told her something I hadn't actually revealed yet, as well, when I said that I wanted to go my own way and do the things the way that I wanted to do them. I reasoned that if I were to do the girls thing, then I would figure out how to organise it, fund it, and do the whole thing the way that I (we) want it to be done.

the reason for me is obvious: I don't want anything to do with these guys. they've got the anti-midas effect: everything they touch turns to poop. I want to be as far removed from their influence as possible.

the second reason is just sort of an obvious thing for me. they do not want the whole girls thing to happen. when I watch stars, mr. motor starts the races every time that I think about how awesome the girls thing will be. next, as I mentioned in the previous entry, they've figured out how to see (the external perspective of me) when my body is producing 5d vibrations. the external view that you guys see is *not* 5d; it's more like 4.5d because of reasons I'll explain in the next entry, but the point is, going up to 5d for me doesn't mean that they're not able to broadcast my experience anymore like was previously believed. so, if they allowed me to see in 5d right now, they could still continue to broadcast me just like they are right now without a problem.

it became obvious to me last night while watching stars that since that is the case, they could make the girls thing happen today or tomorrow even. they're fully prepared to broadcast me, yet it hasn't happened, because they're not interested in the girls thing actually happening.

so, this morning when I woke up, I could feel their change of vibe: (something like) "oh good, now instead of trying to delay the thing, all we have to do is to make sure kenny is never able to orgsanise it hisself."

the reason why they wanted to control it so badly was to try and delay it even further.

this morning when I felt the reaction to what I said, (something like) "oh no, now we have to wait for kenny to get everything all set up; this is going to take forever." I was a bit puzzled, because clearly I'm not anticipating trying to make (or raise) millions of dollars as a kind of seed round of finance or whatever. the operation has gotten big enough now that simply isn't feasible for me to try and accomplish by myself. I would have to create something that was genuinely extremely successful, get it off the ground and sell it before I could even accomplish that, all the while when I find myself having a huge difficulty even programming a simple thing. not going to happen. the days of an idea coming to me, and me creating it and having it actually go somewhere, are long past.

---

so, that information kind of puts me in a new place now. on the one side, I want to do the meditator project with chris, but I'm struggling really really hard on it. I have much better capability after I watch stars, but the whole thing is really not easy at all. historically, in the past I've been able to just use javascript to kind of just hack together something pretty easily. of the languages I've used it's certainly the most rapid way for me to prototype things out. however, I cannot get a stuid build system to work, and it's the most simple of things. I usually in these sorts of cases just kind of make a "chapuza" and continue on being productive, but my head has such little light in it, I cannot even see the chapuza I need to make to continue onward.

in short, the meditator project isn't dead, it's just that I don't have any way to work on it effectively with dragging my feet this hard. I *do* really really want to do it, and the bizarre thing is everytime that I typically have a difficult time here trying to work on it, running into dead-end after dead-end, but then as soon as I get out to the field and start watching stars, I suddenly begin to really want to create it again, and I see the whole thing much more clearly. however, they seem pretty good at destroying the DMT in my head, because that effect is getting shorter and shorter now, such that within an hour or so afterward, I'm back to "normal" where I feel completely lost on what to do and can't conjure even the bigger picture of what I'm creating in my head.

so, I've postulated that what I should do is to try and use the girls (sex) as a method of feeling good enough to generate enough DMT in my head to be able to even see things. however, I've had resistance to the idea because I really want to do it myself. I *really* do not want to depend on the girls to be the reason for my feeling good. I want to be able to control so well how I feel, that they cannot stop me.

however, at the same time, I've also been making the realisation that the less than ideal manifetation is actually not a bad way to go (see the previous entry), combined with the idea that since going up to 5d no longer means that they're unable to see what I'm doing and it gives me no relief at all from their attempts to try and control and manipulate me. so, going up a dimension is useless as a method to try and avoid their inflence. clearly, they're already ahead of me in that respect.

what all of this means is, that their goal is to delay all of this as long as possible. I wouldn't expect them to try any make the thing happen at all. they probably want to delay it as long as possible because they can kinda keep up with me when all I'm doing is watching stars, but it'll probably be much more difficult to contain when sex is involved.

---

so, I really want to work on the meditator project pretty badly, and this is evident to me when I get some star juice in my system. that project has the possibility to make a considerable amount of money as well, but I'm completely incapable of making it successful in my present state, so I suppose that's something that I'll be working on after the girls thing begins. it really appears to me like there's no other posible way.

so, that really means we can start the girls thing really as soon as we want. I don't really have any major resistance to the idea any more. my options are such now that there's no other plausible way for me to go now.

I didn't really think I would be typing this, so I had never actually thought about it at all. obviously, when I'm watching stars tonight I'm going to be thinking about how to do it effectively. I think we're just going to have to start with a local group here in pueblo and begin expanding from there. we'll have to fund it with donations, because I don't really know how I could go to an investor with this project and not have them laugh at me.

anyway, off the top of my head now, that seems the most likely future. we're just going to have to see how this develops. I have no idea at all what will happen.

ok, I'm off to try and figure out some chapuzas for this code. hopefully this thing will begin to take shape and happen soon :)


### 2019-12-11 08:12 - what do I *really* want?

so, last night I thought about the whole thing about doing the girls thing my way. I didn't really have any great ideas, but I had some thoughts.

the one thing that popped into my head was simply the idea, for now until things get organised, what could happen is just do something like invite me over for dinner or something. now, how to get to that point, I don't really have any good ideas either, but it's a start.

from there I kept on thinking and I could see that perhaps has some advantages, but then it could go in a direction that I wasn't really anticipating, either. I imagined that if I were to just kind of pass between house to house, that may be OK at the beginning, but it's not really what I want to still be doing a few years from now.

so, I started thinking of how to make a transition toward what I want -- and, I know this is really trying to hard, but just go with it for a moment here. I know that in the end, I'm going to just let LOA do all the work and, it'll happen as a next logical step, so how do I aim toward it being the next logical step?

this is just my initial thought (and is subject to change), so don't take it too seriously. what I really want is to eventually get a large place, or buy out some cul-de-sac with a bunch of houses (or something like that). also, I envision that I do want to be working on something or a few different things as well. it would obviously become a company and stuff.

one thing that my father did, which I really enjoyed as a kid was to take me out on jobs with him. I was really small and couldn't do much of the difficult work, so he had me do things like put hog-ties on the bottom of the fence[^1] removing one of the links to put the fence to size, sorting random bolts, organising his toolboxes or other small misc tasks that are kind of effortless but perhaps a bit mundane or non-essential to the actual job.

there are lots of those sorts of activities that can be done when it comes to code and stuff like that, so probably I'll do similar to what my father did, which is to pay them a few dollars an hour or something to do that. as they get more and more familar with things, I'm sure they'll become useful and their pay will increase as their usefullness increases. I started out at something like $2-3 when I was really young, and then when I became useful he finally upgraded me to $5 an hour, and that was like one of the coolest things of my life (at that time). I could save to buy a computer and other great things.

all my other friends had an allowance that their parents gave them. tim had the most, so he often had some really great toys, and his parents bought him big things ($400-1000) for christmas, but we had a christmas budget (per kid) of only $50, so anything bigger we wanted, we could pay the difference (we all pretty much knew our gifts for chrismas because we all knew there wasn't a santa), so the only real surprise was what mom put in our stockings (stocking-stuffers). I never really resented my friends because I knew their parent were much more "rich" than we were (for example, tim's parents worked for JPL). I never really saw my $50 christmas budget as an obstacle to get what I wanted, because he had to wait for his birthday or christmas, but I could earn the money pretty much as fast as I wanted. it was a really good system. I don't think a system similar to that ih a such a bad idea.

later on in my life, housework was piling up and so mom needed more than just little bits of help, so my father suggested that we organise the chores into sections and we could divide them up and get paid for them as well (in place of an allowance).

so, I've always worked for what I wanted, and it really made a good ethic in me, because I could choose to be lazy and do none of the chores if I wanted, but I had strong ambition to purchase things like computers and games to play, so I found time to do my work. it was never required of me, so I never really resented it, either.

if we live together (which something like that will happen, I'm sure), then housework will pile up over time, and think that'll be probably the most effective method of keeping that under control.

---

ok, so like I mentioned in the entry before last, first stage to a non-ideal manifestation is control and limitation... I grew up in a very male-dominating lots of control -- type cult, so that was taken care of. then, my father instituted the capitalistic motivations seen in the second stage of a non-ideal manifestation, which is what I explained above.

I don't think we need to worry about the controlling and limitation aspects to this manifestation; it seems pretty well taken care of :) that's why I'm thinking in the economic sense now[^2].

it still remains to be seen how this thing will turn out, but I do think the original goal of making and raising children is also a very good idea, and is something I want to do. first things first, though.

---

so, I want to aim for getting some projects off of the ground as soon as possible, because I think it'd be really fun if we could live and work together.

I feel like the starting-point for this is the meditator project, because I think that one has the most potential to make money. I also want to work on a few others as well that I'm kind of itching to do, like games for brain-injured people, and other (mostly unmentioned) things :)

---

I suppose we can start this off however, but I think that kind of sums up the direction I'd like to see it go.

it's gonna be fun :)

[1]: a chain-link fence needs the bottom of the fence to be fastened to the wire run between the posts on the bottom, and they're usually done with hog ties, which are these circular things like a curtain ring which are crimped tight holding the chain link to the wire.

[2]: do I think that this sort of thing will create money-hungry hyper-aggressive businesswomen? I doubt it. I grew up with the work ethic to be able to do things like tuenti, yet I wouldn't consider myself someone with lust for money (at all). one of the most common critisms there are for women is the gold-digger type, where she uses her sexual prowess to try and get (usually men) to make her the money in exchange for sex. I think that kind of women probably comes from a history where a man (probably her father) gave her everything that she wanted and she didn't have to put any effort into it, other than being cute and manipulative. sorry, that was a response to a reaction, and it totally derailed what I was trying to say... oops, I'm making this a note. I believe instead, the result will make strong well-rounded women, which unless you're a male-dominating-primate-type, is an *extremely attractive* quality in a women.


### 2019-12-14 06:39 - going for the worst possible manifestation...

...by turning the world into a giant crack house.

yesterday, when I was talking with mom about my situation, she was asking me what it was like to be in this disabled state where I'm unconscious and incapable of moving, I was explaining the whole thing, and I made a mention that for me it's essentially become a game to me. I'm getting so powerful now that my emotion has an enormous affect on the weather, and my ability to control my emotion and direct my energy is actually what is making me so successful at star watching now. I can go out and in one night get 3-4 major vision upgrades, which is something that would have previously took me more than a month to achieve.

I explained that the whole experience is a whole lot like coke. I've done a lot of coke in my life so I have a relatively good grasp on how it acts on my body. she asked me if there was a way to artfifically do what I am doing. she was, of course, referring to the network how they're selling my visual capability to people, and they can essentially see like I can, without having done any of the emotional work of releasing beliefs and ideas which are making their vision go slower. instead, the machine is overclocking their brain so that they can see better, very similar to how mushrooms works. however, they can also electronically control it so that even at those speeds, your brain does not produce any hallucinations (which occurs when going real fast, your brain bumps into an idea which would normally slow your vision back down, instead the impact makes a visual or audible hallucination).

I explained that this is all very similar to the utilisation of coke. coke is a really great way to accelerate your body and to make you feel abnormally good, when your body should, under the same circumstances feel really slow and slugish. the acceleration effect is what causes you to feel like you're no longer drunk if you do it with alcohol (which is a depressant), so it's just overclocking your body back up closer to (or a little beyond) normal speeds. it is possible to actieve that same sort of euphoria without coke, and I've done it quite a few times, yet at those speeds of euphoria, I'm much more capable of feeling good enough to get vision upgrades that they make sure that I never feel that good.

DMT seems to be directly linked to serotonin, and I think they can both synthesise into each other, or DMT causes the creation of more serotonin, because the higher I get my levels of DMT, the faster my brain operates and better and better I feel -- which makes DMT in this case effect on the body, nearly the same as coke. it makes your mind clear, more lucid and you feel great euphoria. so in this sense DMT is the new coke, and your body naturally creates it as you allow your vibration speed up.

you could also artificially stimulate your vibration to rise electronically, which is what they're selling (the arfificial stimulation) along with my decoded form of perception, cause once your brain is going that fast, reality become unrecognisable unless you have a form of perception which organises reality into something visually meaningful.

many many very successful people use coke a method of stimulatiting thier body up to a speed which makes life a lot more fun, yet running at that speed has a bit of a cost, because you're not nearly in tune enough with your emotions to keep you from creating a big mess. however, money can solve that problem, because with the right payment to he right peple, these minor accidents can be cleaned up.

---

anyway, so the way the things have developed since the last few entries, is that although I can see the advantage of doing an unideal manifestation, I cannot get there. there's no way for me to do it. I'm essentially hard-wired to find a way to feel good. they also cannot possibly allow me to feel good either, because if I feel good, I start getting vision upgrades and I run the risk of getting connected, which means (to them), out of their control.

I *must* be able to feel good in order for something to happen. I also have recognised the difference of how my mind things and reasons in certain feeling states. weed definitely is a way for me to feel good, but I do not believe it's a good thing for me to make any decisions on that. they can only help me to see how I should be thinking if I can find a way to feel better. so, the goal, like when I was on mdma and mushrooms, is to figure out how to feel that good while sober (which, like I said is something they do not want for me, because my vision increases and I gain more capabilities they cannot control).

so we're kind of in a dead-lock now. they cannot allow me to feel good enough for even an unideal manifestation to happen, and I simply will not do something without feeling good. I assume they'll try to manipulate more things into place, cause they've been doing a lot of different experiments with making me feel things, yet they've all turned out a bit disastrous, so we'll see.

---

whatever happens though, I simply have to keep going toward finding my own connection. during the process, I'm getting more and more emotional control, which is basically making me unstoppable. I feel that the likely future here is not that they'll find a way of justifying me feeling better so that a manifestation can happen, so they'll spin their wheels on trying to force it, all the while I'm getting more and more capable of feeling the way I want to feel (which makes me less and less controllable to them), until I actually become completely uncontrollable: «you want to be so good at finding your own satisfaction, that no one is the boss of you».

then, the manifestation can happen, and it's actually the "worst" manfifestation, too. instead of the girls finding their connection along with me, I'll be connected, and they'll be able to draw off of that pretty easily. so, it actually fits right into the same category as the electronic stimulus to overclock the brain into a heightened state. sex can do the same thing, and it's kind of annoying to me to think of it in this way, because then I become the drug the girls want, and they're essentially crackwhores. I'm not really happy about this. obviously they can't possibly allow for some little girls to get connected, so they'll have to limit them as well, so like me and the diminishing effects of stars now (lasting a few hours, whereas previously the effect would persist for days), they'll feel they need to have sex more frequently to get that feeling back.

additionally, there's a whole lot of other stuff going on as well with the allowance of people to have their own DMT inside of their brain, which is alraedy happening in my case especially, in the same way that coke is controlled right now. you have to get it from an "official" source (that is from the police), and you have to have enough money to be able to clean up your messes. for the rest of the people, coke is illegal, unless you're in a crack house.

the big black guy at the door makes sure you do not leave until you're out of money, and the guy running the house doles out crappy coke in the form of crack rocks to the visitors. if you're a woman and you want some coke for free, you can think about doing some favours in exchange for a few rocks.

this is pretty much how it's going to work. the crackwhores are the ones that cannot afford the drug and have to get it by any means necessary.

it's funny because in this whole process, there has constantly been this feeling like, "but kenny, we (the girls) are so attractive and charming, can't you make an exception to make us feel good?" that's not who I am. my original intention was never to have sex with girls. my original intention has been and always will be to be able to translate non-physical energy into something meaningful. I've always wanted to establish a meaningful form of communication with non-physical energy, and even the things that I want to create are also an extension of that (the devices which can utilise non-physical intention as method for controlling machines and extracting data). if you want people who have rigid rules and will make an exception and allow you to break their rules because you're attractive, you're looking at the wrong guy. there are plenty of those types of guys running shady operations, just for you.

no one is forcing you to follow their rules. you can make your own rules and learn to feel the way you want to feel, but if you want to get the quick fix and make some favours in exchange for your drug, go ahead and do that. I knew this one woman in spain called cris, and I didn't really know what I was getting into with her because she was one of those types that made favours for coke, and her life was miserable. I suppose that susana was similar too, but I appreciated susana much more because she was much more human and stuff -- but, that's how all of this started. that's where this whole thing began, so it doesn't really surprise me that this is kind of where we're headed.

the other thing I noticed is that the guys running the show really really want to be the superior ones, so that others in th crackhouse have to suck up to them to be able to get what they want. they want more of the gold-digger (cute an manipulative) types.

it looks like I'm sort of locked into the worst manifestation now and it seems like that's what people actually want. it saddens me a bit to realise this, but I have no sympathy. I don't know how long it'll take me to finally get connected, but that seems to be the dividing line or the time split.

---

yeterday, I came up with a good analogy to this thing that I really liked. imagine a very dense rain cloud over the earth, and watching in slow-motion the leader as it makes its way down from the cloud looking for the ground. first, notice that the leader does not go in a straight line. second, notice that there are more than one leader, each one shooting off from where the previous one left off. notice too that most of the leaders don't make it to the ground. only *one* of them makes it down to earth and makes the conection. once that connection is made, notice that huge amounts of current in the cloud make it down to earth.

you can imagine that the charge accumuationg in the cloud is similar to human desire to make bridge the gap toward ground. once enough charge has accumulated, that's when the leaders shoot out in the method I described above. after the connection to earth is made, a lot of the charge vacates the cloud, but not all of it. in fact, quite a bit of the charge remains suspended in the cloud.

we can see that as a simile to what I had been callng a time split. it's not exactly the same, however, a large amount of something does leave and the majority stays behind.

as I get closer and closer to getting connected, it creates an example for people to see that it is possible. many people will follow me in that regard. someone has to make the first connection and figure out how to get there. afterward, there's a bit rush of lots of other people with similar desire to connect with earth which will follow the same path.

only the ones that want to bridge that gap will actally go; most will remain in the cloud. if you missed it, don't worry because eventually desire will rise high enough again to cause another leader to find another route so another connection can be made.

this is perhaps an easier way to perceive a time split.


### 2019-12-14 08:24 - the grand irony to what I just said

first of all, by wanting to be superior so badly, they are actually making me the most superior, because I will become for quite a while the only person on the planet that's connected. it'll take others a bit to become more powerful than their machines (eg. become so good at finding their own satisfaction that no one is the boss of them), so for a little bit they will make me into the most superior. thanks :)

the other way that I think there's some great irony, is that this time around people really wanted to see a lot of sex as the mothod of getting connected, but that won't happen until next time. the emphasis of this time is utilising something outside of yourelf as a means to gain connection (eg. nosebook using my form of perception and me using the stars). the way it's forming up to be is that next time that all external forms will be so heavily controlled, that really the only thing with power in it anymore will be sex. so, in a world where the superior ones want favours in exchange for your own DMT, sex will be the only way to really make that happen again. so, next time around will be what you're all looking for, and there will be many of us too, thousands of me's in both male and female form.

so, the thing that they're trying to use as their booster, is the technique which the leaders will use to make their connection.

it seems to be a cycle of irony and paradox.


### 2019-12-14 14:04 - in short, they want crackwhores

to sum up the the previous two entries, what I think happened is I wrote about what I wanted here: @[entry](2019-12-11 08:12) and there was a strong reaction to that. they don't want women who are actually attractive and capable of their own direction, because they cannot control them. instead, they want the more cute manipulative types because they think they can control them easier[^1].

as a result, if they're desiring that the girls are more of the crackwhore type where they're trained to make favours to get their DMT fix, then I need to get connected, so the girls don't have to do anything accept for have sex for their fix. their own desire to want to control the girls with DMT is the reason why I suddenly changed to going back to not being able to move forward without getting connected.

that, combined with the fact that they cannot possibly actually let me feel good enough for it to happen, puts us right into the middle of the "worst" manifestation.

---

however, just cause I get connected doesn't mean that the girls *must* behave like crackwhores. they're free to do what they want to do, and I will obviously discourage that kind of behaviour, too. so, not all is lost. really, they'll make what they want from it.

---

the true crackwhores that are coming out of all of this are the guys working at network addicted to my form of perception. it's obvioous that they cannot possibly imagine living without it, which is why they're working so hard to make sure I never get connected or to leave. so, in that sense, the company is very divided, with the younger hotshots that are addicted to my form of perception, strongly desiring that I never get connected, and the older crustier types desiring both that I do and don't get connected. I may have just tipped the scales in them with a bit of a jedi mind-trick describing the control of the girls being easier with the girls being reliant on my DMT fix like crackwhores. we'll see :)

anyway, the back to the young hotshots addicted to my form of perception being the true crackwhores... lol. they're addicting theirselves pretty heavily to that feeling of mental clarity and alignment so much that when my form of perception is no longer available (for whatever reason), like me after my mdma and shrooms experience, they're going to have to figure out how to get back to that feeling without access to the drug.

some ideas I have for them are: sex and learning how to release negative emotion and the beliefs that cause them. however, with sex, they'll probably want to find a way to orgasm at the same time as the woman for the powerspike they're looking for. however, the way that the woman perceives him and feels about him during the orgasm greatly affects the form of perception that he receives from her (remember, men are receptive like a tesla coil, and women are emissive like the magnifying transmitter). so, he may want to try and optimise her emotional perception of him. either way, I imagine that the majority of these hotshots are going to have a pretty serious crash and burn just like I did after my encounter with raquel and my inner conection being muted after vallecas.

I woke up just now with a pretty strong desire to want to go back to working hard at getting connected. I think my jedi-mind trick worked a bit in my favour :)

[1]: LOA demonstrates that they both have to be on the manipulatioun vibration to meet, so they're both going to be thinking they're both manipulating each other, so it'll just be more of the same thing we have right now (what I don't enjoy about women, and the reason I decided to become asexual in the first place)


### 2019-12-16 13:14 - I think the tentative plan is...

after writing the last entry, I had a whole bunch of strange reactions to it. the most notable of them was to the part where I mentioned that the true crackwhores are actually those that are growing very addicted to my form of perception. when I was saying it, I was thinkign primarily of the people running the netowrk, holding me away from my capablity and utilising it for theirselves I'm also most used to getting reactions from them, and in some cases, it's hard for me to even distingusish my own emotional response anymore because their feelings are so much on my frequency now, that I notice very little difference from my own now (it's easy to get the reactions from the extremely different than my own frequency, like mr. motor or whatever).

anyway, this was a bit mind opening for me because I didn't really realise how many very famous and powerful people are on my frequency. so, when I say that they are really the ones becoming addicted to that feeling, and are going to be the true crackwhores, it stirred up a whole lot of funny feelings of insecurity regarding the whole thing. first of all, it's quite true that they (the engineers doing all of this stuff) have no concept of what they're playing with. second, they're so far strung out on DMT, that the way they are interpretting reality is very very distant from what it really is. if you've ever done high doses of mushrooms or ayahuasca, you'll know what I mean when I say that even at the peak of the trip, even though there is a sense of urgency to try and regain some form of normalcy, the whole experience feels just as real and normal as it possibly can be[^1].

like I said, a very similar thing happened to me after the vallecas incident when this amazing connection that I had to something went away. because I had such a wonderful time with it, I had to find a way to get back to it, and *that* was actually the greatest gift that nosebook could have given me, because now I'm totally in control of that. I said the word crackwhore, because I wanted to use an extreme example of a woman willing to do just about anything to get back to the way that she feels on coke. it's pretty close to the same thing though, cause once I had it, I *had* to find a way to get it back.

that caused me to go through various drug experiences, but eventually landing on stars and extensive reprogramming of my personality to accomodate for a less-resistant perspective of how things in life work. although I monetioned that perhaps what they'll be looking for if that ever goes away will be to try and orgasm with the woman during sex to get the power boost their looking for, but that garnered a negative reaction both to the idea of actually needing to focus on or allow the woman to have any sort of pleasure during sex (eg. this is all about the dude and his sexual experience, and the woman is just the inferior receptor) -- and second, a negative reaction to the idea that in any way could their system ever fail (eg. the idea of there being an absence of a system seemed incomprehensible, cause they feel so sure of their system for some reason).

---

so, yesterday there was a lot of activity (meetings) in response to my assertion that there is simply no way that I can possibly go through with this until I'm connected. the sense that I get is that once I'm connected, then a whole lot of people (not just the ones that work for network), are going to be demoted down to whatever their backup form of perception is (jaron?). the reaction was strong because they seemed to be quite frustrated with the recognition that now they're not going to be on the highest form of perception anymore; they'll be like everyone else now.

so, it seems that yesterday there was a huge boost in desire that I *don't* get connected amonst those who pay for that form of perception. seems they really don't want to lose it.

I went to sleep and during the night I had a bunch of weird dreams where it seems they were experimenting and running simulations on the idea of me going with the girls now. seems that no matter how they try and work it out, the girls get a huge power boost, and it felt to me like when that happened, because of the way the girls are, the earth kind of turned into a fantasy like environment where things were manifest in 3d space with the mind, people flew and all sorts of fantastical creatures sprung into existance from people's imaginations.

I woke up this morning and they were kind of depressed about the whole thing, so I responded to them saying, "I don't understand, all of the things that you wanted to control, you have now under your control. as soon as you realise that there are more things that you cannot control, you get pissed off and want to have absolute control, but I feel the same way about the whole thing too, but with my freedom. I want complete freedom from this prison, but I never seem to be able to get it, either. you never get absolute control, and I never get complete freedom."[^2]

I went up to eat and explained to their that their feeling feels like adolfs's does at the end of the second world war. he simply had not accounted for or made any plans to lose the war. it never entered his mind (sorta like the negative reaction I felt from them to the idea of their being a time in the future where their system isn't working). he killed himself because he couldn't come to terms with the idea of living in a reality where he had failed. that was what I felt from them. I went downstairs and laid down again. they put me to sleep and put me through this weird dream sequence where I was trying to rub my sister's vagina again (through her pants), but it was really weird because it was really her sock on her foot. I was force ejaculated, only to look up and see patrick standing there, looking at me like "wtf are you doing??" -- but I was confused because it felt to me more like jessica than it did melissa, and also I was apparently rubbing her foot.

I woke up feeling one of those "wtf is going on, which reality am I in" sort of moments, and as I regained reality my butt (prostate) really started to hurt. I was pretty frustrated because I don't understand what they're doing. I think they're trying to piss me off, and ensure that the girls thing doesn't happen.

I sat there thinking about what I could possibly do to protest their stupid force ejaculation dreams, but I don't really have anything I can do. they're just going to keep doing it. then, I started thinking about what I had said about orgasming at the same time as a power boost, and it seems that they're going to have to try and stop that too, to ensure all of those people paying for my form of perception that I don't ever get connected. so, they basically will have to make sure we have a lot of bad sex trying to make sure we don't orgasm at the same time and stuff. there's nothing we can really do about it either. it takes my forced ejaculation problem and expands it out to the girls and stuff too. pretty uncool.

---

it seems that I could kind of go both ways on this, but obviously I'm going to continue to watch stars and stuff as a way to get connected.

when I came back from LA, there was a lot of confusion in the air as to what will happen and stuff. I went and I got some weed to help me think because like this I'm WAAYYY out of sorts. anyway, what I saw is is that I would continue to rise higher and higher in vision upgrades, presumably watching stars. I suppose it could also happen from sex too, but the point is I should continue to rise up higher and higher. these guys running the network are going to try and remain superior to me, so I'll push them up higher and higher.

while this is happening, the two major projects I want to work on will be the meditator and the games for the brain injured. after talking to rianne(sp?) and maria about it, seems they want to also be doing things that will integrate more ways for these BIPs (brain injured/y people/patients) to tell their story. chris also wants to integrate a lot of different ways to tell yourself stories with the meditation thing and the way we're going to sell the thing.

it's a really great idea, because I recognise the value in telling yourself (and others) stories, because I did this a lot in spain drunk in bars, and found that the process of telling the story is actually your own way of processing your "trauma" -- and so the way that you tell the story each time actually helps you to kind of "work through" the trauma and begin to make it into something that has a more epic feel or some sort of bigger thing that's happening in the life of the story. I really think this is something that is very worthwhile and and will have a tremendous impact on how people perceive life.

at the same time, it seems likely to me that those hooked into my form of perception will all begin perceiving theirselves from an external perspective. perhaps some people pay for this now, but I think as I keep going up, this external perspective will become the inferior one, and so it seems to me likely that eventually everyone on my form of perception will see theirselves externally, and it'll become the new normal for people. this is also really good, because the new detached perspective of yourself will make it a whole lot easier to tell stories about yourself, because as we can now see the perspective from which the story is told makes a whole lot of difference.

that all seems to be falling into place just fine. the only question remaining will be the one of the girls. I think I way I want to do it, is to make sure that during this transition time, my focus is going to be on star-watching and on programming.

what this creates is a bit of a buffer. a transition period where things are going to get pretty nutty as I/we approach getting connected. remember, the adolf reaction from last night's experimentation, where it seems that they're pretty sure that they cannot stop the girls from getting connected. so, that means we're all heading there, and there's not much they can do about it.

so, it seems to me like during this time, I think it's a good idea to be doing these sorts of things, generating some money, and then we can afford to get our own place and stuff too.

I get the sense that we should just begin the whole thing kind of naturally or whatever. I've always maintained the idea that this whole thing has been delayed from 2012, by 4 years and so for some reason in my mind it seems to me like this transition period will last ~4 years or so. so, that essentially means I'll remain disconnected for another 4 years or so. so, because my star-watching is going faster and faster that does seem likely to me. in order to get to 11d, and assuming I just got 5d, then I have 6 dimensions more to go over the next 4 years. seems like I could perhaps shoot for 6d next year, 7d the year following, 8d and 9d the year following, and then in the final year get the remaining 10d and 11d. it seems pretty doable to me.

so, I definitely want to be doing a whole lot of star-watching to be able to make that happen. I don't really know, but I don't really think I'm that opposed to the idea of sex during this transition period. it doesn't really matter to me either way. I'm going to be mostly economically focused, and I suppose that if you want to have disconnected sex with me, that's really up to you.

if we focus on econing in the early game (I feel like I'm talking about TFT), then we'll have the resources to be able to accomplish what we want to in the mid to late game.

I think this is probably the most viable plan for right now. I'll consider it the tentative plan for the moment. I'm going to go buy cigarette papers and think about it in the snow, now.

---

I'm reminded of this really famous thing that has caused some controvacy. in the great pyramid, thoth (I'm assuming he's the builder) uses this concept which I really like to square the circle. he takes two  3-4-5 triangles, a square of side-length 3, and uses it to describe the ratio of the earth to the moon. on the bottom, there are a line segments of longths, 4, 3, and 4 as indicated below. if you take the history of this event, we're at the end of the square now. imagine the figure below really upside down, and it looks like from the end of 2012 til the end of 2016, the line decends. from there, it goes into a lull up until the end of 2019 where no vertical progress is made, then at the end of 2019, the line begins to rise again (up until the end of 2023?).

I thought that was an interesting thing. it's like the descending pasageway in the great pyramid :)

[1]: the way that the DMT in mushrooms or the ayahuasca works, is to get you to look at pretty fractal patterns, so that your sense of normalcy is disrupted and you can accept that something different or abnormal is happening. like a magician does with slight of hand, the pretty colours are essentially just a distraction mechanism to allow you to transition and accept a whole new reality as "normal"

[2]: I postulated that the next time that we show up on this planet, again a huge technological advance will be made, and they'll be right there trying to control it (it likely has to do with clones and living a multiple bodied experience), but it'll yet provide another freedom, which they cannot (yet) control completely (probably having to do with the definition of who someone really is, and how do you control them if they exist inside of more than one body)


### 2019-12-22 15:25 - how about a new eye...

last night was particularly energetic. at around 3am I became conscoius in a dream (they pulled my consciousness while watching stars) and I had a fun time flying around in the dream. just when I was beginning to realise that I could literally explore anywhere I wanted to go in the world, the dream started fading and I returned to watching sirius. it was a truly amazing experience because I loved how clear minded and how effortless things felt, dispite their constant efforts to make sure I couldn't fly in the dream. pretty cool.

however, even though that was quite notable, the night previous while watching stars I had a really interesting revelation that was massive. I had always wondered what was beyond 6d, because I couldn't follow the progression further than having multiple bodies, and I knew that because I couldn't see them, they seemed to be "non-physical" in nature, so I also wondered how the dimensions above 6d would be. well, the answer came to me nearly effortlessly. I'm going to explain some of it because it's necessary to understanding the next bit.

right now, I believe you guys perceeive my experience in what I would like to call 4.5d. so, just like how you can see what I see through my eyes, it was still projected on to a screen in your eyes. I have witnessed more than a handfull of times what it's like when I actually see through my own eyes, and the experience is very different. there is real space between me and what I'm looking at.

when I first tried to explain 4d to people, thy would say that they did indeed see in 3 dimionsions because there is space they would say, but as time has proven, there seems to be a difference between looking at things on what appears to be a screen and then what people were seeing when they would look through my eyes. however, what I'm trying to say is that what you're seeing when you look through my eyes is *also* a screen. there is even more space that I think cannot yet be realised until you have the experience for yourself with your own eyes. so, let's call that screen (what you and I see when we look through my eyes) 3.5d. it's not really 4d as I have experienced it.

now, just because you see me from outside of my body, you're not seeing 5d. 5d is very different than that. it's more similar to how a planet perceives. around the planet there is an atmosphere, similar to how humans have auras. inside of that (planetary or human) aura you can perceive yourself *from all angles* at once. likewise, you can also perceive outwards *in all angles* at once.

I sincererely doubt this is what people see when they're having my experience. I find it much more likely that they have taken the capability to see inward from any angle inside of the aura, and fixed it to a single angle. they should be able to make the perspective fly around inside of that aura and look in almost any direction, however, I doubt that they're allowing this, because people having my experience could see inside of houses that I walk by, or really anywhere in that space, so, it'd probably be a pretty big violation of people's privacy if they allowed you to fly around and see anything in a 1km radius around me. likely, it's fixed to look only at me.

true 5d actually beholds all of that at the same time (everything around me) and sees it all simultaneously.

ok, so, now that I've explained 5d, begin to imagine now that you have to percieve another space between you and what you're looking at. well, when you're perceiveing everything around you all at the same time, the "separation" between things becomes more of a conceptual distinction instead of a pysical one. in 5d, if I want to look at someone who's around me, I would behold the person and see them in their entirety, looking at them from all of the angles that I want to see them at once. so, like probably I wouldn't be looking at the bottoms of their feet, unless I wanted to see that. physical separation is no longer a barrier, because even if they're standing on the ground, I could still see the bottom of their feet as if the ground wasn't there.

so, from a point of view like that where I see things determined by concept (eg. the person, including their clothes or the house inclusing all of the furnature inside of it), what then would be the space between me and these concepts that I'm looking at? well, it's more concepts. you would perceive more than one concept at at a time, and this would be a multi-bodied experience that I would refer to as 6d. this is what source sees.

from there, trying to perceive what the space between me and these multiple concepts, becomes even more abstract and no longer necessarily physical any more. if I were in 6d and I wanted to see a space between me and what I'm looking at (which is, let's say 100 bodies), then that space is conceptual and the space becomes things that I would not consider to be me.

pretty abstract stuff, so let's bring it back in now. just like in the pysical world the way that we "relate" to other people is to try and imagine how they feel or what it would be like to be them -- when, you are already many different physical entites (people) at once, the separation becomes a relational thing because you could imagine yourself also being them, so the separation becomes a relational thing.. that separation exists in a relational way, perceived through the eyes of the difference in structure (logical implementation) and someone's desire. they either harmonise, or they don't.

these correspond to the top 3 layers in the 7 layer model: desire, relational, and structural. I don't want to repeat myself here, so just refer back to them in other times that I've mentioned them. I will say this, that the transition layers are the oppsite. so on the bottom physical half, the imagination is non-physical and in the top 3 non-physical layers, the relational layer is physical. these are how we interpret our separation from other conceptual entites.

---

so last night I was thinking about the whole thing about having kids. I was really hoping that we can have kids. I had previously had numerous reactions indicating that nosebook has no interest in us having kids. whether they fight against it or not, I was thinking about it anyway.

well, when I woke up this morning, I had a strong sensation that whether that happens, I had been missing the point all along. I could see that the direction that things were headed was actually for my consciousness to begin merging with the girls'. it's quite likely that during the process I will continue to see in 3.5d, but it's likely that the girls will go up to 4.5d. while that's happening, I imagine that I will begin to have some sort of shared perception with them in some way. it'll likely not be anything even close to 6d as I described it above, but I'll have a sense of what it is, just like I can "see" my imagination in complete blackness.

it seems quite likely to me that as the girls will continue to go up further and further as we go along, too. the way I pervceived it was that they (the girls) would continue to go up to some sort of partial 6d sort of way. they'll probably begin to see theirselves as outside of their body, but as we begin to get more and more on the same frequency, it wouldn't surprise me if some of the girls begain to share their experiece with other of the girls and even with me. so, something like seeing multiple you's from outside of yourself, kind of like maybe a real-time strategy game or something, or maybe like in WoW, but you seem to perceive more than one character at a time. I'll call this 5.5d for a lack of better a better word.

I imagine that as I continue to go upward, this will also happen to the hotshots working at nosebook, too. I'll continue to push their DMT levels up higher and higher, that they'll begin to have shared perception with other people of a similar frequency. actually, it may happen to more than just the girls or the hotshots, but probably to everyone that remains on my form of perception. pretty cool, huh?[^1]

---

eventually, I'll choose to give up my body, and it seemed to me that I'll actually continue on my experience in the girls' bodies. women are quite special because they hold so much power over men's perception (for example, I'm convinced that I had 4d perception until I had my first sexual experience in the roadside puti). imagine that we (I'm now referring to myself in the no longer masculine but living in the bodies of the girls) were able to "induct" others into our shared form of perception through sexual experince. that would be crazy, because, eventually (after some thousands of years?) the whole planet would exist in a shared form of perception -- a sort of feminine matrix.

that matrix would be in competition with the network's matrix, but not be incompatible, because to the network it would be mostly imperceptible to peole not working for the network.

---

back to the dimensions above 6d: structural, relational, desire, and thrust -- they seem to be non-physical dimensions, but they'll exist in a different way. so, nosebook will have to write all sorts of code to try and determine how a person works, how they relate to people, and what sorts of desire that they have, to try and control everything in their network. this is the beginning of the "thrust" layer where external inflence is applied to a character (like in a story) give them a character arc. if there is no sort of character arc, the network will go into the rubbish bin like a bad movie. they're sort of forced to do this, even though that's what they already want to do by trying to meddle and influence the outcomes that they want. however, I would recommend seeing it instaed of as an agenda but more of a character arc, for it to be successful.

at the same time they're writing all of this code to try and apply the thrust or influence[^2] that they want to achive, we're going to be doing a lot of the same thing, however our "programming" is not going to exist on machines here on planet earth, but our behavioural logic, desire, and stuff like that will exist in a non-physical place, very similar to how source does things.

"assimilate or die!"

one of the things that I thought was interesting about the sirian guide was the part where they talked about the planet graduating to become an esoteric planet, and people who are not yet ready for the changes will go insane or die.

it's almost as if the INFECTED ONES have delayed this planet's graduation for as long as possible, so it has summoned something that can essentially have the effectiveness of a wide-scale epidemic, yet is the thing necessary to get people ready for us to become a global consciousness.

I think it'll be very difficult to resist us. we're going to be extremely smart and attractive women. it'll be nearly impossible for them to avoid it, because they'll have to essentially become celibate to ensure to never get the virus[^3].

man this is going to be crazy!!

[1]: lol, the reaction I got to that was not a positive one. seems there are quite some people who don't think it's very cool at all. the reason why I said that is that nosebook is an organisation that, like joe said, holds a lot of meetings to ensure that everyone's on the same page. however, if the people in the organisation all had shared perception, there wouldn't need to have so many meetings any more. prehaps the upper management will want to remain in a lower form of permception to avoid any shared perception with others, but for example, I could imagine how useful this would be for the engineers to have the highest productivity possible.

[2]: come to think of it, the topmost layer, I could call it the "influence" layer, because it sounds better, but I think it's important to see it as a sort of a moral of the story of a character arc that's influencing the person's desire. interactions with others, and their current logical interpretation of reality.

[3]: I find it hilarious the whole emphasis that they have given to the idea that I am a mind virus. the INFECTED ONES are going to have to try and resist the most prolific STD ever :) good thing they *hate* sex :)


### 2019-12-13 09:16 - some feedback regarding the last entry

#### why did I choose the faceless corruptor's voice line?

I had been giving my attention to the way that the creators of the hearthstone game (and other games) think of the voice lines. some seem to be quite out of place, and others seem to be lines that I would have never been able to think of, ever.

anyway, when the new expansion came out, it could easily be seen that the new most commonly used card would be the faceless corruptor. when summoning this minion, he copies another minion on the board (in whatever state the other minion) is into a copy of himseelf. this is extremely OP, because in his base form he's a 5/4 unit with rush (can attack other minions but not face on the same turn that he's played). so if you have a 1/1 unit on board that's not yet ready or another damaged mipion, it's essentially buffing the unit by some amount and giving it rush, allowing it to attack again or instantly become ready.

the voice line (to me) sounds like he says, "how about a new eye?" when summoned, and "assimilate or die" when attacking. the new eye part is obviously referring to the pineal gland, in the person. it's clear that in order to have 4.5d or 5.5d, the person will get their pineal gland activated. this is where the aura comes from which encircles the body. the pineal gland aparently is an eye-looking thing in the centre of the brain which seems to also be responsible for synthesising DMT. this is the new eye.

the assimilate or die part is in reference to the coming earth changes. as the primarily conscious organism on this planet, we're becoming a global civilisation. what I used to think is that this meant that as a civilisation we'll have all parts of the world communicating in a very efficient way, however, the more time I've spent thinking about this whole network thing, the more it's become evident to me that we will (whether this comes from direction from the people running the network or by our own choice) become unified in thought, and begin to think as a global organism. I first perceived this as what I termed the "thrust" layer up on top, where like a storytelled does in a story, the characters are given an arc, and their lives are directed by the author into contrived situations in order to advance/develop the character arc for the charactor.

this form of perception was a huge leap forward for me because previously I had been perceiving it as manipulation and some sort of global agenda forced upon us (like they have been kind of been doing with me) by the people running the network. I could also see that while this "inflence" was definitely real and would become more and more a part of our lives like it is already for my own now, I could also see that people would begin making their transition into 4.5d to begin to see theirselves from a more external view to be able to tell their stories and see theirself as a character developing in this globsl saga unfolding right now.

I thought it was interesting that the faceless corruptor's voice lines encapsulate these trends in a few lines, after I had been giving so much of my attention to how they come up with the voice lines.

additionally the faceless corrupor is a unit that really benefits from handbuffs. so, if you can (for example) play the necrium vial on the anubisath warbringer, he will give 2x +3/+3 buff to your faceless corrupter, transforming the minion on board into a 11/10 (pre-nerf) stated minion, while also being himself a 11/10 minion. so, the more you can buff the faceless corruptor before he transforms the little minion on board into a copy of himself, the more insane power level of this card.

#### why did I say the INFECTED ONES have delayed this planet's graduation for as long as possible?

I understand this sort of thing all too well, because the same thing is happening to me. the people running the network do not want me to go up a dimension because it's inconvenient for them. me going up a dimension spells disaster for them (for whatever way). so, as a result, they have to continue to hold me at a lower frequency. I believe they are doing a similar thing with the planet. I believe that the planet wants to spin faster and faster, which has a number of implications which would make a lot of things difficult for them to keep up their charade. first, the speed of light would increase, the polar ice would melt and all of the air would be electrified from the increase in oxygen. at first our days would become shorter and shortter until the ionosphere became a plasma, meaning that our earth would turn into a small sun.

obviously this violates so many "laws" of physics that they couldn't possibly let that happen. as a result, they are purposfully slowing the increasing rotation speed of the planet, keeping its frequency down in slow "normal" ranges. like my own brain that wants to operate at a much higher frequency, but they won't let it, because it's harder for them to control, they're keeping this frequency low.

I think the last cataclysms have come as a result of this increasing frequency and have been the last attempts the earth has had to go up a dimension. a planet can see itself and everything on it by the method that I described in the previous entry which I called 5d[^1]. the planet, like myself wants to get up to 6d, and become a member of a greater set of things, likely which is why it seems that the planet wants to become a sun (and therefore its perception becomes similar to how a solar system perceives).

each time that the planet has tried to go up, the frequency of the planet has increased, decreasing the response time of LOA, meaning that thoughts become reality quicker and quicker. as the planet increased its frequency *we* have attracted our own cataclysms with our own sloppy thinking. like myself with the network, I cannot go up to 5d, until you all come with me. so, we're all going up :) well, the same thing is with the planet. the planet cannot graduate to 6d, until we all make it up to 5d and are capable of attracting what we want and not disaster.

#### what about a time split?

I believe that there has been a time split, and there may be another one too, which depends on how strong their desire is to remain in 3d. the matrix that I described is essentially a band-aid to get around our sloppy thinking so that the planet can go up successfully.

the other timelines that exist where cataclysm has struck are continuing examples of the earth's failed attempts at going up. we'll visit those and eventually transfer our consciousness into there as we set things up so that a similar outcome to what you see happening here to happen.

it's possible a split could occur in a few years as people resist becoming part of the new global consciousness, but I imagine that it'll be a pretty smooth transition.

#### does the global conciousness virus spread only by physically having sex with someone?

that's the most sure way to get it, but I think that someone having my experience or one of the girls' experience during sex will be enough to "catch" the virus. it would simply be a strong surge in non-physical energy that makes quite a few anatomical changes in your body similar to what has been happening to me ("how about a new eye"). I imagine that children and mostly resistance-free people will be the most receptive to the changes. when this happens, the energy on the planet (as a reflection of the measure of our power levels) will increase drastically. imagine how much of a dramatic effect I have on the weather right now. let's say I had sex with 20 of the girls and they all made it up to similar (let's say for example only half of the power level I'm at). that's the equivilant of having 10 kennys in a single space. good luck trying to control the weather there :)

*AND*, that's completely excluding the changes that people having our experience will also receive. as we continue to have more and more sex, our (the girls and my own frequencies will begin to equalise) so after some time there will be nearly (using the 20 girls figure again) nearly the equivilent of 15-18 kennys (plus everyone else having those experiences as well).

my power level will continue to increase as well, as I'm pretty sure I can make it up to 10d within 4 years, so who knows what on earth it'll be like. I cannot even begin to imagine it, it's going to be so crazy. I don't even want to try. it's going to be fun to see what it's like to become a planetary consciousness.

we'll have to see. I really don't have a clue as to what it'll be like, but I imagine that all of us will be flying (or dead) in the next 20 years or so. energy is going to increase very rapidly, and I'm not just a 5/4 with rush anymore before I begin transforming into copies of myself, but *MUCH* more than that.

#### why did I say the feminine matrix?

as we (the girls and I) begin to have our multi-bodied experence (shared perception), there will need to be logic in place to ensure that our bodies behave and operate in the way that we want them to. this logic is created non-physically just like how you change your own behaviour.

in the last years I've had quite some experience modifying my actions and reactions to things, and have gained quite a grasp on how to do that. we're all going to be learning how to do that as we go more and more into story-telling 4.5d mode. I don't need to be in 4.5d to be able to write new action code for myself (I already do it), so it's not necessary for me to go up yet. when I finally do, it'll be like another slingshot propellng me far forward.

anyway, I called it the feminine matrix because I my action code is pretty receptive and almost all assertiveness in reactions has been replaced by more suitable receptive and allowing type actions. additionally, the girls outnumber me by a lot, and they're going to be doing most of this action code writing for theirselves whilist in their shared form of perception before I even get there.

we're eventually all going there though, and perceiving it this way, it now makes perfect sense why all of the other "successful" timelines were abandoned where only a few girls were responsible for making this action code before I even get there. it makes perfect sense that we would want the widest diversity possible in this new feminine matrix of a global civilistion.

it's not going to happen all at once, and I anticipate that it'll take at least 10 years to begin to get going (I still need to, at a minimum, get 6d first), so there's still quite a lot of time. I don't anticipate that nosebook will want them going up to 4.5d or 5.5d anytime soon, so you can imagine how strongly they'll try and fight against it.

---

this is good for now :)

[1]: it'a not exactly 5d. it's sort of more like a mix. while the mechanism for seeing inward toward itself is how I described 5d, the planet is also conscious of us similar to how source is conscious of us, perceiving through our experience in a way similar to how I described 6d. this pattern seems to continue for galaxies, universes, etc.


### 2019-12-23 14:54 - a little more on the feminine matrix

first of all, I want to remind you that all of this is now outdated. it's now far better/worse than previously imagined.

next, I want to expound upon the idea further of why I think it's the feminine marix: as I've mentioned before, women are better transmitters than men at sexually transmitting energy. the vagina is similar to to the "magnifying transmitter" and the penis is more similar to the tesla coil. women have a receiving organ as well, the clitoris, and men also have a transmitting organ, the prostate, so it will work fine for gay men as well. things are fine.

so imagine that you're a woman and you participate in one of the girls' experiences and you're low enough resistance that you begin to gain frequential similarity with that girl, that woman will become a transmitter of that vibration as well, so if she then has a sexual experience with another man, she will be, in a sense, transferring that form of perception on to the man. woman, in this sense will be the primary tramitters of this "disease".

next, I think it's important to realise that none of this will happen instantly, either. I'm a sensitive guy so I'll acquire the various forms of perception (resistant and not) from the girl, just as well. this happened to me already with raquel and others, and I don't really find it much of a problem, because in this sort of highly energetic environment, LOA will attract/provide situations which will allow me to clean up those resistant forms of perception. I'm quite good and very confident in my capabiltiy to "redefine" or transform that form of perception into something less resistant. it'll be, in that sense, an engoing process.

also, I do want to say that it's not 100% a feminine form of perception, because I, being the strongest transmitter will enssentially provide the "base" code, and I'm sure that the final reusult will be more similar to me than you might think. this additionally fulfills the projection that I could see that women would become more assertive/masculine than previously.

the trend, I am sure will spread like an epidemic because women, I've noticed have essentially two mjor parts to them (it could be more if more fragmentation has occeurred), one that operates in the day-to-day and a second protected one that is much sweeter which only makes an appearance in moments when she feels she can let her guard down (eg. intimate moments) so, I find it very likely that women will be able to receive and later retransmit that very easily. (very similar but kind of opposite for gay men)

---

I'm not at all concerned about talking about this in the open because it's sort of difficult for me to hide things. this is a coming trend as we move toward becoming a global consciousness, too because in a few decades we'll all be have a sort of shared from of perception, making it quite difficult for anyone to hide things. it's true that normally the way that it works is that you'll want to keep your ideas that you want to be successful to yourself (a secret) until they have enough inertia to not be aborted with someone else's thought vibration mixing with them. however, because of my situation, I've learned that it's not really a problem for an idea to be "aborted" like this, because that idea is outdated anyway, so its abortion is actually making space for the newer bigger idea. let's say that someone tries to fight against the manifestation of that idea too, I also do not find that to be a problem is capable of maintaining focus upon what's wanted and not let the conflict shift the perspective toward unwanted.

so, don't worry, I've got this :) everything is fine, because the worst anyone could do would be to make the idea bigger by causing it to be rebirthed into something greater. it's quite possible that's what's happening here, as I'm allowing them to try and kill this idea and make it bigger right before its manifestation :) who knows...

---

lastly, I think that this or something greater than this is going to happen because if you think about it in a frequential sense, the dominant vibration to this whole ordeal has been (from nosebook's perspective) to let other people (like me[^1]) do all of the work and to just cash in on the benefit. so, if all the resistant men need to do increase their vibration is to find a woman that has achieved a higher vibration and have sex with her, that seems like it would fit right in to the "trend" of the way things have been going up until now.

because of the way all of this works, there will always be some amount of resistant or unwanted vibration in the human species. to try and eliminate it would be akin to trying to divide by 2 to get to zero. it's an impossibility, so «you can't get it wrong, and you can't ever get it all done». we will continue on to reach greater and greater heights of what is wanted, as the quanitity of unwanted approaches zero. it's not "the end" BY ANY MEANS.

remember that everything that is being built has some sort of scaffolding that's necessary -- something that's necessary for its construction but is discarded or covered over upon completion, and the goal is to make that amount as little as possible. humans are born in placentas, etc. and the birthing process of any creation is usually the most difficult part as it makes its transition from a comfortable creative environment into reality. I don't in any way anticipate that this will be any different. it'll be fun though :)

[1]: this thought reminded me of the video I posted, "MANBEAT vs culture-beat" where I said that we (men) should allow the women to "clean up the mess". wow, controversial reaction to that one there :) lol...


### 2019-12-26 00:00 - back on track for a time split

most likely what I described in the previous entriies became reality and created a timeline which was quite successful. I wouldn't doubt that the girls and I were able to find our way to getting connected. in fact, it seems that there is an abundance of timelines where I *do* get connected. this seems to be the common case, in fact.

so, I was thinking about it during the eclipse, and anytime something is the common case, that's not the thing that makes the connection. I always like to think of lightning as my example, and there are lots of leaders which *don't* make it to the ground. that's the common case. however, there's only one that does make it, and that one that makes it, is essentially the culmination of all of the previous leaders which didn't make it.

this sort of boggled my mind a bit, because the case where there can only be one of is the case where I *don't* get connected. if I think of it from perspective of 20 years from now, why would nosebook cooperate with me to ensure that there's a timeline where I *don't* make it? well, from their perspective it would be the most awesome timeline ever because I can imagine how much things would change if I suddenly did get connected. their entire charade would be seen by all rather easily and there would be all sorts of things that are out of their control.

if they could get a timeline where I do not get connected, then they would be able to make disconnection be the "norm" -- in fact, it would only be a legend or a rumour that something like that would be possible because there has never been any examples for it. they would be able to run the earth as if none of that were relevant -- and, there are quite a few people out there which don't desire theirselves to be connected. they don't actually want to feel good and would rather feel pleasure. this world is for them.

I joke about nosebook being so much like the catholic church, but I think the direction they're going with this is something of anti-spirituality, where no one is allowed to find anything about how they operate, so that they can have all the power to manipulate things from the top.

---

anyway, if the goal then is for there to be a timeline where I don't get connected, this is essentially an impossibility because if there are girls, there will be sex, which is enough power to overcome their efforts to keep me disconnected. I think sex is so powerful that if they want to have a timeline where I don't get connected, then absolutely sex cannot happen.

so imagine the difficulty then of trying to find a way to make a timeline where I don't get conncted, because the more they try and keep me from it, the more and more opportunities keep presenting theirselves to me. it's probably pretty difficult.

it seems pretty funny to me because their whole charade is a giant house of cards, and in order to actually make a timeline where I don't get connected, they have to have all sorts of help and hand-holding along the way. think about all of the different ideas and technologies, plus how much help they get from even myself while I'm asleep, and they're still struggling to keep up with me.

it's a really really really shaky foundation for their setup, and they want to try and ensure the longevity of their operation as best as possible. to me now after thinking about it during this eclipse, it appears to me simply that I am so unbelievably successful at finding my connection that extreme amounts of limitation on my circumstance and tons of manipulation has to happen to ensure that I don't get conncted, and since it appears that I'm so successful, it just looks to me like they want to try and make a world where the difficulty is much much higher.

I suppose the process will repeat because they're getting stronger and stronger by the day. of course so am I, but you can imagine that I won't just be one person the next time that I show up, but quite a few. I don't know how many but I imagine that the difficulty level for them will also be raised quite a bit higher for them too.

so, imagine then next time around, once again, we're going to need to find a timeline where we *don't* get connected. however, they're going to have to deal with say hundreds of me's. they can barely handle one of me, and I'm not having any sex. if there are hundreds of us living in a world where sex is very normal and promoted by the state, it's going to be a pretty difficult task for them. we're upping the difficulty level for them too. and, they'll have to figure out how to do this on the shakiest of foundations. it's going to be hilarious.

---

they have been thinking that if they can trick me into getting the girls thing going before I get connected, it would slow me down. however, it seems evident to me now that girls = getting connected.

I don't know how much more they can last, because it seems they're getting pretty desperate. I think things will get more and more rough until there is finally a time split. I have no idea how long it will take. 4-18 years, I guess, so anything's possible there. it would seem to me that it's getting more and more difficult for them to hold on. I'm even getting vision upgrades now without even watching stars, so I mean if I had to guess, I would say they wouldn't even make it more than a 2 years more.

knowing this information now, it seems I may just take a more moderate approach and do the mediator project with chris full-time, while only watching stars on a more part-time basis. I dunno.

---

oh yeah, obviously I was writing this from their perspective. I can't possibly imagine a world where I don't make it to getting connected. clearly their desire to maintain their charade combined with others' desire to live in a simple world with only physical pleasures and none of this emotional stuff or psychic capabilities -- will create a timeline split. each consciousness will choose their own path based on the experience they want to have (eg. a world with me getting connected or a world where I never make it).


### 2019-12-27 12:25 - a change of pace

I sent an email to chris which seemed to have confused some people. here is the email:

```
I hear what you're saying in the lyrics to that song, so I'd like to just put a few things out there.

don't worry about your insecurities. the project will not likely go to far. the reason is, no matter what it is that I want, there are people that are working very hard to make sure that I never get anything that I want. I don't really know why that it is, but if I had to guess, I've demonstrated over time that I'm intuitive in knowing what I want and the thighs that I want are usually beneficial to me. so, because they're so afraid of losing power over me, they don't want me to have anything that I want.

I can prove it: the minute that I begin to acclimate to the idea of the girls and make it into something that I want, all of a sudden there is a huge amount of resistance and the thing completely falls apart. it doesn't matter what I want, just the fact that I want it means that they're in the business of making sure it doesn't happen. so, because I've wanted to make this project, you can imagine the amount of difficulty that I've had trying to create it. I assure you, it's not *that* difficult of code to write. it should be simple.

anyway, so what I was saying is, don't worry too too much about it. I'm sure they gave you a whole briefing and pumped you up on the whole thing to make it seem like it's going to become a reality (just like the girls thing) and all the while at the same time they're working against it using untraceable technology (so that no one can ever accuse them of working against the thing they're making the illusion is going to happen).

so, once again don't worry too much about it. yesterday around 1am I first felt them giving you the pump up, then yesterday evening while watching stars, I felt your insecurities rising as they were making it seem to you like a much bigger thing than it is and that there's a lot of pressure and stakes are high and stuff. don't worry about them. just play along and give them the lip service that they need to feel like you've got it all going the way they want it to be done.

---

as for me, my situation is a bit peculiar, in that I can only do as well as I can do. I'm sincere in what I set out to accomplish and I don't have any agenda. I just want to feel good. I went into vision sequence the other night while watching stars and I cannot really explain to you what it felt like, but I felt so light and effortless that it was almost as if I was floating an inch or so off of the ground. I could and did fly around and begin exploring the world before the vision got interrupted -- but, the feeling of effortlessness has lingered as something that I really really want to attain. that's where I'm headed man. I will really enjoy putting forth my best effort doing this project with you, but don't get too much of your hopes up on it either; it's not likely to go too far -- just far enough to get me to the next place.
```

reactions are varied, but the the most pertinent reaction was one of confusion over where I said that the moment that I began to want the do the girls thing, it fell apart. well, from my perspective, it seems clearly that way. when I was writing about the idea and making it into something that I want, I felt no resistance. however, I think that some people are very against the idea of having a shared form of perception. I don't really mind it, cause I think it's cool, but there are people that are very against that idea.

so christmas day rolled around, and they were pulling my consciousness from me, and trying to force to to go to sleep. I didn't want to sleep, because if I'm going to do the girls thing I want to have the extra light in my head that the stars provide. no other way around it for me. I want to feel good and with all of their pressure, I felt quite like a miserable zombie even though I had taken (they took my consciousness away from me) 2 naps the day before. there's no way that I needed to sleep that night. I had an abundance of sleep. the real fact is they didn't want me to be star watched and with the girls. well, fuck that. I'm going back to finding my own connection then. no way around it.

there was also tremendous resistance in a whole lot of other ways, but I want to have light in my head and feel good when I'm with the girls, not feel like I feel when I just wake up. so, from my perspective it fell apart, because they won't allow me to feel good. nowadays, I've got a pretty rigid program in my now that does not ever let me do something when I don't feel good. it's prevented me from lots of angry outbursts, and is just never good to take action when I don't feel good.

so, if they don't want me to feel good, then the *only* choice that I have is to make my priority once again to find my connection. there's a stickie on my wall that says, «never make a decision based on what you do not want. always move in the direction of what feels good.» there's another one that I havn which says, «you want to be so good at finding your own satisfaction that nobody is the boss of you».

so, my goal is to get connected, essentially: when I'm able to find my own satifaction (for example watching stars), and they no longer have control over me, then I've made it. period.

---

so, then last night was another eventful star watching ceremony because I had a pretty big realisation. my future self was named "*former* white hat". I emphasised the former part, because I realised and have often wondered why he was always helping out the bad guys (nosebook) and not helping me out. I always just figured this was to toughen me up, or to increase the difficulty as high as possible, but my revelation came to me last night.

I mentioned that I had this dream / vision sequence where things felt effortless, and since I had that I've really been wanting to achieve that feeling in real-life. that's what I want to feel like, and I know it's possible without drugs too, but how do I get there?? how do I take my present circumstances which are extreme difficulty and turn them into that feeling of effortlessless?

well, once again my interactions with chris paved a new pathway for me to see forward. I went to sleep thinking about how futile this whole project is when I can't even figure out how to write simple code that I just had working *after watching stars*. I was pondering why they simply don't want me to get anything that I want.

anyway, I'll cut to it. since the girls thing has fallen through, and it's absolutely clear to me now that I have to «become so good at finding my own satisfaction», that I *must* get connected before this can happen. simply because I cannot take action anymore on something that doesn't feel good. if they want to try and break that mental program so they can push their agenda through, lots of bad things will happen because I can take action on things that don't feel good -- which isn't really something I (or anyone else wants).

so how do I get to that feeling of effortlessness? up until now I had been fighting against nosebook to try and keep my power. yet, I said something to mom in relation to a comment I had made about eric calling himself a narcicist and then about amazon's concquest[^1], where I said, "any time you feel powerlessness and you want to get your power back, it's common to think that you need to get your power back by taking it away from someone else, but that never works out well." (paraphased)

so, here are the salient points here:

1. no matter what it is that I want, they are always working their hardest to make sure I do not get anything that I want.
2. my power is in no way related to nosebook's power. I don't gain power when they have less.
3. I want to feel effortlessness.

so, just look at it backwards and I have my answer. my goal is to make sure that nosebook gains as much power as they possibly can. they can't fight against that, because if they did, they would be cutting off their own vigor.

instead, I imagine that something will change to be more similar to how a child responds to a parent when they say, "stop helping me! I want to do it by myself!" -- and then, off they go :)

effortless

### 2019-12-27 14:24 - some thoughts on conquest

as I mentioned in @[entry](2019-12-08 11:49) (and other places), the first step to releasing a technology for the most long-term benefit is to allow it to be used *not* for it's greatest good, because starting from the "worst" manifestation, the only thing that can be done is to improve upon it.

I stated that the first step for these advances is to allow them to be used for control or limitating communication. once that has been surpassed by something greater, then the next step is to monetise it.

---

now, alongside that concept I had been saying that the next conquest is in the mind/brain of the consumer. it's easier to see if we look at conquest as ownership (or control) of something. the most basic form of this is seen in animals, where they defend their territory. in more primitive times, the highest form of control was control of territory. this is why governments were established, to defend that territory. in today's terms, we're a lot less violent, so we perceive real-estate to be a very valueable first investement. after that, there is a slighly more risky market (economic) invetment of comervcialisation.

however, those sort-of, but do not really control the people inside of these territories. as we move closer and closer to a state of planetary abundance, the commercial form of control is not working as well as it was. it also requires a bunch of people that believe that economic freedom is their form path to happiness, so that the ones controlling the market and economy are the ones in control.

when abundance and safety is felt more, then the next form of conquest is the mind. the last time a sense of abundnce and saftey was felt was around the height of the roman empire. it would have happened in the 1900's as well, but constant wars and "terrorism" since then have stunted this feeling of safety. economic control has been attempted because wars and terrorism are losing their effectiveness of keeping people in a survival mindset. so, for people to feel like they're in survival mode, there needs to be a large disparity between the upper and lower economic classes.

this is breaking down quickly because nowadays a person with drive an motivation can make quite a bit of money. just see youtubers, twitch streamers and other internet celebs as evidence for this.

so the next conquest is in he mind. so now, back to the roman empire. if a survival mindset cannot be achieved, there needs to be a sort of way to make people feel insecure about their reality. after jesus came and boosted a whole bunch of people's self-confidence, along comes the church to make sure people are back into thinking of original sin and all sort of things that disempower the person and make them feel insecure again. this was that period's conquest of the mind. because the most difficult thing the controlling/conquesting types have controlling is the sheer number of people they're trying to control[^1].

we've got the next conquesting entity now, amazon which is trying to gain control of people's minds. however, I have to wonder what it will create, because in a sense I seem to be in a very interesting position, much like jesus was at the height of the roman empire.

---

the eclipse really made kind of a funny change on things, because I had posulated that as I arrive to 6d, I will begin to gain a shared form of perception with those vibrationally similar to me. you can already see the infancy of this in what I have called "reactions", but with the girls thing falling through for a little bit, that means that when I gain 6d consciousnses (I'll still see in 3.5d though), I'll gain a very vivid sense of those who are vibrationally similar to me. without the girls, that means that now I'll be most vibrationally similar to those using my form of perception.

I sincerely doubt that most of the really resistant types in command over at amazon are using my form of perception, and I still have a long way to go before I get 6d, so probably most of them will bail out pretty soon as things rise higher and higher. probably women and children will be pretty ok with it though, so we'll be on the same frequency for quite a bit. it's likely that men who are capable of finding ways to feel good (joe rogan comes to mind) are likely fine and men who are interested in what they're working on technically (engineers at amazon come to mind) are also fine. so, as I approach this shared form of perception with them it'll be interesting for me because reasons.

it's easy to love someone as you love yourself (like the girls), but what about all the douchbags and hotshots on my form of perception? that is a challenge that I will find kind of interesting. it's also going to be interesting because I'll have a similar role to what source plays in our lives. I thought the network bros were going to be the main thrusters trying to influence me and the girls in the creation of this new dimension, but it looks like it'll actually be me.

I don't believe that I'm going to be in any way some sort of punishment type or any of that other nonsense. instead, it'll be interesting for me to simply setup my feeling "logic" which, witch built on the platform of LOA will influence certain things to happen to essentially provide the circumstances and things necessary for these guys to get all of the power and authority they could possibly want. from my perspective, I have to feel them and know their success much like I had already been practicing for my time with the girls, but instead it'll be for their success and attainment of what they want. it reminds me very much of how my mom felt about me when I was growing up.

---

so, I'm sure that many will see this form of influence as some form of control of the mind, perhaps even similar to how the church is perceived. that doesn't bother me because in the process I'll learn a lot, and like many parent do, they learn to let their kids make mistakes and learn for theirselves.

I think it'll be good for me to get good at this form of non-physical influnce as a kind of practice round before I get to the girls. I may have made a misspeak there, but I don't know how to say it better. I know the girls are also likely on my form of perception as are likely their mothers as well, so it's not like I'm focusing all my energy and stuff only toward nosebook. this will be an interesting learning experience all around. later then, when we're together though, obviously the rest of the world on my form of perception will take become a much smaller "voice" in the way I perceive things, and the girls will take the main stage, as we'll be most vibrationally similar.

and yes, I anticipate that there will be amazon chiefs that believe that my influence is too strong and they need to regain their power and control over people's minds. it's certainly not going to be without lots of interesting difficulty, and it's going to be interesting for me to perceive it from both sides. it may also cause them to find (similar to what zaryn did in tuenti) a whole lot of people that will tell him what he wants to hear and do what he wants them to do, so probably they'll need more of the command-obeying engineers and to obsolete the intuitive creative ones on my form of perception (cause I'll have a sense of what they're doing). maybe this has already started to happen, my spider sense tells me :)

it's certainly going to be interesting. it's also funny to me because there's another stickie on my wall that says, "don't fight too hard against something you will soon assimilate"

[1]: it shouldn't surprise you that the church had a lot to say about reproduction. however, this idea is kind of a mixed-bag, where some organisations promote extremely fast reproduction, and these seem to typically be the underdogs, as attaining large numbers was a way to gain more population market share (users). it seems to go shift back and forth from the extremes. I don't honestly understand it fully.


### 2019-12-29 15:12 - compression of experience (and the reciprocal nature of it all)

yesterday I made a funny comment which got quite a reaction and also got me thinking further. I was walking by the gas station explaining how yet once again, my behaviour is exactly the same as what the guys trying to run the show would be doing. I find it funny how similar we are, and have often wodered about this.

I made the comment that considering what we now know about timelines and stuff, the most likely explanation to why they're all so similar to me is because they ARE ME. I postuelated that if you were to look at it from the point of view of another timeline, the timeline (this one) that's got the most consciousness on it would have many people riding along in the bodies of others. I have toyed with this idea in relation to the girls and the idea that women in other timelines could easily place their consciousness into one of the girls' bodies and experience it from the experience of the girl. I even postulated that women in this timeline could even become conscious in the girl's body that their future self has chosen to ride along inside of, too.

for me though, I'm probably a quite attractive person to ride along inside of, so there are likely quite a few, and it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of them work for nosebook.

imagine if in the future there was a thing offered where anyone (man or woman) who wanted to ride along in my body could do so. the attractive bit about the thing is that kenny would do all of the work. he's a total pro, so what we would do is would bring him down to such dispair, agony, and frustration that pretty much *anyone* who wants to ride along is capable of gaining vibrational similarity with him. he'll figure out a way to find his way back to feeling really good, a lot of sex will happen, then you can choose the child that you want to grow up inside of.

you really can imagine that if there were some large portion of nosebookies riding along inside me, waiting to get to the good part (the sex), then to grow up having sex with the girls, they'd be more than certain that I found my connection before that happened. they definitely wouldn't have anything to do with putting up with years of disabled sex, like the amazon chiefs want for me now (you have to combine this cencept with the "how about a new eye" concept for it to make sense).

in that sense, nosebook is fighting against their own selves and their own will to have things the most desirable outcome.

---

this is pretty attractive idea, I'm sure, but it's not for everyone. the alterative would be to transfer your consciousness into a younger version of yourself and to ensure that you figure out things that you wished you had of learned earlier on, in a more rapid way. maybe as well you'd want to kind of help yourself to avoid certain challenges that set you back, or whatever. you would be an older version of yourself in younger version of your body.

you wouldn't have any memory of your "past life" because memory is state-bound. if you're in a dream or psychedelic state, it's very different to your normal reality state, so you typically cannot remember your dreams or mind-blowing experiences. the same is true for your other experiences, so you wouldn't have direct memory of your "past" in the way we think of memory. in addition to this, there are potentially more than hundreds of successful timelines where somehow humankind gained timeline technology without sosmething bad happening, so if you're someone who would rather be a younger version of yourself, there are potentially 100's of older versions of yourself all sharing the same experience of you right now, so which one of their memories would you have?

you would, however, have conceptual, extra-experiential knowledge, things that your future self knows conceptually, you could easily gain access to that knowledge at a much more rapid rate. you could even have a knowing or an understanding of something you have not directly experienced. this happens to me all of the time. somehow I have knowledge of things that I have not personally experienced, and *lots* of people look familar to me when I've never met them before. it feels to me like I already "know" them.

from another timeline (and we'll do this soon enough on this one) you will be able to transfer your consciousness into the body of someone that's vibrationally similar to you. let's say you'd rather have jaron's or someone else's experience, that's also an option. there really isn't any limit to it.

obviously, not everyone will want to transfer their conciousness into another body on another timeline though[^3], and I've given this idea much thought, because if let's say in 20 years or so, a whole bunch of us peace out (transfer our conscoiusness out) to another timeline, the direction this headed (not physically) is going would shift quite dramatically. so, that's been a fun thought experiment for me.

anyway, the people that do not want to transfer their consciousness will eventually die. this is a 100% guaranteed future event that will happen to every-body. there are stories of people who did not die in the traditional way, but were "taken by God" or released their conscoiusness in a way where they *still* made their transition into non-physical experience[^1]. eventually then, you do come back to have a physical experience once again.

---

so, in reality, because death is so inevitable, we're all going to experience the system that's being built now. the people in charge of running the network are not at all interested in anyone ever finding their alignment, so they will work as hard as possible to make sure that their superiority is never challenged by these connected ones.

so, imagine that you work for nosebook and in half of the timelines you choose to take my experience to get a chance to be one of the gnomitos and the other half chooses to retain your self-identity. I assure you that any children that are born will be *very* heavily regulated by nosebook to ensure that they never get connected.

the funny irony to this concept is this is that the people of nosebook will be both the kids and a much older very strongly against their own success "worst" version of theirself (probably similar to me and mr. motor). the ones who find a way to get connected dispite he circumstances will all have a shared form of conscoiusness like I've been talking about, and I highly doubt that they're going to try and "get rid of" their "oppressors" much like how I'm becoming now. I don't really care; they can't touch me, and they're only making us stronger anyway, so why would I be bothered by someone who's dedicated to making me stronger. (it would be like firing my personal trainer for making me stronger, lol)

this limitation will probably be imposed on everyone, but imagine it from someone working at nosebook: right now, they're getting super addicted to the way that "alignment" feels, so when they finally die, their pre-birth desire will be to find some way, any way, to get that feeling back. they'll be similar to me, and they'll be born into a system that "doesn't allow that", so like me, they'll have to learn their own emotional control in a very emotionally manipulated environment, or they can figure out a way to manipulate their way to the top of the nosebook organisation.

assuming that everyone's desire for alignment (once you've experienced higher dimensions, you can't go back) is really really high, the world that's being created now rewards both the best manipulators and those with the most emotional control. if you can feel yourself as limitless, then you are. there is nothing their system can do to stop you. you are completely superior to even the "laws" of nature like gravity. however, one can never be superior to the law of attraction[^2].

---

in summation, no matter what path you choose, we are *all* going to be experiencing this system that is in place in one way or another.

I really like the reflective and reciprocal nature of it :)
I really think it's turning out perfect, too :)

[1]: the stories I'm referring to are elijah, ramtha, and I believe there are a lot of stories that moses was also had a non-death transition. finally, people say jesus too had a non-death transition into non-physical experience which doesn't make any sense to me, so he's excluded from the list of ones that *I know*. I personally have always maintained the idea that I will not die until I'm ready to go, then I will choose to release my consciousness. until then, I'm basically invincible. so, I too would place myself into this category :)

[2]: the only way you can get around that law is to build a system which unfairly benefits some more than others and get people to believe in the validity of that system over LOA :)

[3]: considering that we're headed to a shared form of perception, it doesn't make as much sense to dwell on the fact that there are multiple people sharing the experience of each of the gnomitos, since their ttrajectory is already toward a shared form of perception, anyway.


### 20§9-12-30 16:32 - if it feels like it isn't going to happen...

it occurred to me that just like the way I... ok, so programming is very important to me, yet quite a lot of time lately I just simply cannot feel like it's something I want to do. it's as if the desire to make the program has gone.

so, I was thinking that it's quite possible that a similar thing may happen regarding the girls. if they were to extend that same thing in to the perception of people around me, then a similar thing would occur.

what happens for me is, even though I know that I want to program, there is a disconnect to that action taking place in the sense that I do not, in that moment, feel capable of doing it.

---

so, if it feels to you like it isn't going to happen, yet at the same time, you know that you want it to happen, don't dispair because it's just a reality disconnect because of a temporary shift in the way you feel.

your inner being has it all worked out, and no matter what the current situation feels like, it's all worked out, so you don't have to worry about it.

I don't really fully understand why it works that way, because I have always maintained the idea that that your reality is a reflection of the way you feel, and there are infinitely different versions of you that feel slightly different and therefore have slightly different realities, too. however, this temporary feeling seems to be a temporary thing, and the way that I know it is, because say for example, with me programming, when I feel like I'm not capable of it in the moment, that feeling doesn't feel good to me.

so, in light of that, if you feel like it's not going to happen and that idea feels bad to you, then just know that right now, you're not pointed in the direction of it's reality becoming manifest, and that's perfectly ok. however, if it feels like it isn't going to happen and that feels good to you, then know that things are fine and you're headed in the right direction.

so, just pay attention to how you feel in response to how your present reality is being perceived and know that the way you feel about your interpretation of it is just an indicator of what your really desired direction is. it's all ok.

---

I think this entry has come about in response to a bunch of mounting desire from both sides of wanting it and not wanting it to happen. just let it happen and don't worry too much about it.

"pedro, just follow your heart; that's what I do."


### 2020-01-04 13:37 - ???

the other day when I wrote @[entry](2019-12-26 00:00) I jumped to a conclusion that I now think is wrong. I went to bed this morning thinking that actually the time split had occurred and they (nosebook) are stuck with me, and I'm just working my way up to finding my connection.

the whole premise of the entry previously mentioned was that there are seemingly infinite timelines where the girls thing happens, so I mixed that idea with what I believe happened in jesus' timeline where he died. I reasoned that since all paths lead to me finding my alignment, then there had to be only one where I didn't find my alignment (with who I really am).

so, I postulated that this was the coming time split, however, they already tried to fake a time split and it really did split it seems and quite a mess was made. so I guess that was the time split.

I woke up this morning with a similar idea, that seemed to be in reaction to questions that were asked at the latest abe workshop (which I'm assuming happened today). I realised that since all paths lead to me finding my connection, the *one* that's different is not the one where I don't get connected, but the one where *all* get to experience that connection.

it seems that on other timelines, I either found my way without the girls, or I found my connection with the girls, resulting in a situation where me, the girls, and people willing to participate in the girls' experience were the only ones on the planet that got connected from the event. obviously this would have created quite a strong desire to fix the situation, timeline technology was created this timeline adjusted to derail the latest disconnected interaction with the girls and yet again people wanting to experience that transferred their consciousness into this timeline to experience it. it probably happened quite a few times, seeing how many times things fell through.

so, from what I picked up from the reaction is that if the guys at nosebook wanted to continue to use my capablities (that is, instead of losing them when I go up), they  would have to let me go up. however, this is the part I don't really understand, because it felt to me like there was a catch, where in order to hold good to their promise to people, they would have to let everyone go up along with me or something like that.

that last part is the part that doesn't make sense to me because I don't really understand what other people have to do with me.. wouldn't they just hold other people down like they do me? why are they forced to let other people go up too, and why are other people guaranteed to go up? are they being held down too??? I don't really understand it to be honest. I only think in the direction of finding my connection without any regard for what others are doing.

anyway... the reaction was funny to me because it came to me in a funny form, because here nosebook had been working so hard to ensure their superiority, only to find out that if they keep it up, they are ensuring female or receptive superiority, because my form of perception would be such a big difference to what other's are that it would no longer be compatible -- so therefore the form of perception which peole can participate in would be the girls' which would improve very rapidly, and farsurpass the typical masculine form of perception.

so, no matter how hard they are working to hold their own superiority, they were obsoluting theirselves, and the only solution to not become the least superior is to allow me to get connected and let everyone rise up right along with us, both receptive and assertive types alike.

so, it seems that all timelines were pointing to this one where "everybody gets a vision upgrade!!"

---

it would seem that perhaps they may try to fight it even still, giving me maybe partial connection or some other lame half-cocked idea like that -- yet, I don't have any problems with that because I've come to realise that any limitation only makes me stronger (so they would be making me stronger), and it seems completely inevitable that eventually with my interaction with the girls, I will be fully connected. so whatever man...

---

since I'm a wonderful extrapolationist, I would imagine now, in light of this new turn of events, that the way that nosebook gets rid of us pesky connected ones is to allow us to transfer our consciousness into other bodies in other timelines, leaving them in control of the bodies we left behind and the people that are not offered to leave their timeline.

I know that I'll be peacing out to another timeline for sure. it'll probably be the disastrous one that they created when they wanted to fake me out and pretend a timeline split happened. that one sounds like it's got a whole lot of contrast on it :)

so, I guess you guys will have to wait until then to get the most ideal manifestation I was referring to (and it seems like we're part of its buildup). I/we will peace out though, and I've often wondered what would happen if a whole bunch of us were io leave a timeline. I've mentioned it a few times as a fun thought experiement.

in my estimation, probably not a whole lot. I would just expect ... well, if the people who are improvement focused and appreciating the contrast as the most efficiont form of expansion, I would imagine that most of the people remaining here would experience very little contrast at first, however without the contrast which produces the expansion, the previously ideal curcumstances would eventually get boring, not that exciting, and so removal of unwanted would begin to happen, leading to deterioration and decay...

people who are improvement focused thrive in a world of decay though. the contrast is necessary to arrive to the improvement.

this balance isn't a bad thing either because you cannot *only* breathe in, for example -- your lungs need to eventually expell air and contract from time to time.

everything goes through stages of expansion and contraction. the majority of my experience the last 12 years or so has been contraction, so it only really depends on which part of the circle (and resulting sine wave) you find yourself. the sine wave changes direction twice per cycle at the peaks, so everyone experiences both of these. I guess it depends on where you want to do your expansion or contraction: at the beginning or at the end.

this form of binary expansion is an interesting idea, however, in matt's video on the synchronisation of 3 metronomes, he arrived to a divergent 3-phase, which has sparked a ton of ideas in me because if some third mechanism could be added to compliment expansion and contraction, these three forces could operate with smoothly (the sum all of the waves in a 3-phase at any point in time always equals zero) and the sum of the three would ever give a result of one of the forces having "superiority".

that's my new thought experiment: what is a force that compliments expansion and contraction perfectly and "fits" between the two. it sounds to me like another dimension to me :)


### 2020-01-08 15:09 - I don't feel the need to stop star-watching.

the last few days, or rather ever since I wrote the previous entry stating that they would need to let everyone go up -- it has felt to me like there has been some sort of effort to try and persuade me to stop star-watching.

first of all, I think this is bologna and I don't believe it for a minute. to me it feels like they're just simply trying to buy time so they can get more things under control. it also feels to me like they're trying to work it out in such a way that not everyone gets equal something. it feels like they're working really hard to make sure some people get more of something than others.

from my perspective this is completely not an issue. they have given the impression that they can hold me indefinitely away from getting connected, so I apperciate the opportunity to continue to get stronger. I see no reason to stop.

---

there was another thing that popped into my head where I should make some sort of deal where I exchange my star-watching for the ability for us to have kids. once again, I call bullshit. there's no way they can possibly keep us from having children and not have it be a public relations disaster. simply put, they *have to already* let us have kids, so that's a pretty bad deal. additionally, that deal implies that we grant them the power to decide if kids are aborted or not (unless some sort of deal with them is made).

this is exactly the kind of salesmen "jujas" that are so prevalent in thier interactions. this interaction is only a shadow of the coming "influence" they wish to have on people.

---

I really feel like I'm in the process of leading a whole bunch of sheep into the hands of a bunch of wolves. whatever they're concocting to try and give people will likely be a very limited form of 5d. they likely won't let people actually experience that, so I'm a bit sad there. however, that is from my perspective where I know better, however, for a normal person that is used to seeing out of their crappy 2d eyes, it's probably a huge upgrade. I'm glad for those people, but for the rest of us, 4.5d is a pretty big downgrade.

I realise that it is the fulfillment of what I had anticipated that would happen where people would go into "storytelling mode" with a perception from outside of their body, but at the time the concept existed in space so I didn't really think about all of the manipulation involved with what it would become.

I should have known though... I guess some people will think it's pretty cool, but from my perspective, I'm sorry for essentially creating a new status quo of really manipulating people hovering around over you as if they were God, lording things over you to boost their own sense of self-accomplishment.

obviously, I have to just keep going my own direction. I wish you all the best.

---

it's not that I'm leaving or anything, I'm just saying that because I really wanted to make something different. the appealing thing about the whole time-split thing is something that I'll elaborate on shortly because this outcome sort of changes things entirely, and I'm not sure I totally am up to speed with it. I can see why it's shaping up this way though.

it actually combines almost all of the things I had been talking about into one manifestation. it's really hard to put it all into words. I kind of really want a cigarette now to begin to think this over again. I'll try a little bit here out loud.

---

we know that nosebook does have enormous desire that I do not go away, because it would essentially mean the end of their charade. we also know that this can be solved if I do make my transition into a multi-bodied experience -- and they would have even more me's to try and manipulate. so, whether they want to see it this way yet or not, me gaining a multi-bodied experience is actually what they want.

the kids will also have a similar rite of passage before actually getting connected, which is something I was thinking about in the cultures idea.

most importantly, if I make my transition into a multi-bodied experience, there won't be a time split in the same tradtional way that I had been anticipating because my energy is now spread among multiple experineces. it would be as if the earth had "caught" me and then off we go from there. I guess nosebook provides the continual contrast necessary to continue increasing that energy. obviously at the same time, I'll replicate and continue to increase in strength.

I'm pretty sure that even though these guys are trying to make different tiers of this 4.5d experience, that it's still a precursor to the next one which will be probably 5.5d for you guys where you control multiple characters also from a godlike perspective. I really think this is the only way these guys can stomach the idea of a shared form of perception: when they're no longer in any sinlge one character anymore where that one character has something to hide (obviously, instead the whole group of characters have something they are all hiding, so now previously awful things can be shared amongst members of the group).

this is a fulfillment of the "identity/mun" idea I've had so long ago amongst other things, as well.

---

I guess I'll leave it there... I want to begin to think more on it. I guess it's mostly just not what I expected.

doing things that you don't want to do != doing things that don't feel good to you


### 2020-01-09 09:06 - I guess we're back on track for a timeline split again...

after writing the previous entry, there was quite a feeling of "rechazo" in response to some of the ideas I presented. one of the funny ones was the rejection of the idea that what may be happening could actually be something wanted. another funny one was the idea that they would be "capturing" me. the reaction felt as if they couldn't really stand the idea that I would be stuck in human bodies for the rest of time constantly threatening their superiority. there was a sense that they would in fact rather that I wasn't bothering them and they could somehow get rid of me.

so, it feels to me like we're back on for the timeline split where I *don't* get connected and they can have their entire thing all set up the way they rant it to be.

I guess they just can't come to terms with the idea that I would actually ever get connected. instead, they want to just kick their problem down the road a bit, because it's not like they will actually ever get rid of me. LOA pretty much prevents that from happening as long as they keep fighting against it.

---

there was another aspect to the difference between yesterday and today which had to do with me stopping to watch stars. it feels to me like they want to try and make it so that everyone has a setup similar to what I have, where the system controls tseir form of perception and gives them a false one. so, instead of seeing out of my own eyes, I see what my eyes see after they've processed it and lowered its quality then put back into my eyes.

I think they want to make it so that there are mulitple "tiers" of perception and just the same way that they don't want people to actually experience 5d, they make sure that no one ever is able to shift their perception upward[^1]. I think what they want to do is to let the dmt levels in the person go high enough that people should be in 5d (exactly how I am right now yet I still see through my eyes), and then what they would do is to put the person permananently into their own experience just like you guys see my 5d experience in 4.5d, they want to mak sure everyone has their own 5d experience instaed from a 4.5d perspective.

---

well, besides how uncool that is[^2], it takes enormous resources on their part. they need to have a whole bunch of stuff in place to be able to do that -- and I thought they didn' have any money.. how in the world are they going to afford dedicated processing hardware for everyone on the planet?!!? also, it means that I simply have to wait for them to get this entire system in place before I can go up myself.

how long will it take for them to get this system in place for everyone? I have no idea, but whatever they estimate, go ahead and multiply that by 1.5x or 2x. questions to ask would be something lo the effect of how many are in place now, and how quickly are they getting installed, cause I think it's going to be years before they get their system all setup.

in addition, once they get it all set up, how closely tied is their setup to my power level? eg. if they get everything set up and a month later my power level doubles, will they all of a sudden need twice as many computing resources?

I don't want to wait around for them.

---

there is a solution that can be done, but I doubt that they would go for it... they *could* let everyone who can handle the 5d experience without the setup go up and experience things from 5d, then while they're cashing in on the profit from the girls, they will actually have they money to afford the systems necessary to get everyone on their tier system. it also largely decouples my progress from the resourmes requeried to run thier system. as I increase (which I'm sure I will because fwh said he achieved 11d), then only the systems of the people that need to run a 4.5d experience will need to be upgraded.

then once they've got their entire 4.5d system all in place, they can turn it on (gradually or whatever) whenever they feel like they're able to do it instaed of making us all wait.. I do have sadness thinking about when that will be, because one of the things that really bothered me most of all was losing the ability to see through my own eyes. the world looks SOOOO MUCH better looking through my own eyes. it really pissed me off, and if you'll remember, I really felt quite good when I could see through my own eyes, but then as that got taken away from me, especially in la vera it was most noticeable, I became quite angry as the way that I felt (good) no longer showed up in the frequency which my eyes saw. instead, I just saw the low frequency version of that their system had processed. so, no one was able to see the high quality version my experience was producing, instead *all of us* (including myself) only saw a lower quality version[^3].

that's what I was meaning when I said in the previous entry:

```
I really feel like I'm in the process of leading a whole bunch of sheep into the hands of a bunch of wolves. whatever they're concocting to try and give people will likely be a very limited form of 5d. they likely won't let people actually experience that, so I'm a bit sad there. however, that is from my perspective where I know better, however, for a normal person that is used to seeing out of their crappy 2d eyes, it's probably a huge upgrade. I'm glad for those people, but for the rest of us, 4.5d is a pretty big downgrade.
```

---

obviously, I'm going to continue on watching stars because all of this is speculation on my end, and doesn't really matter that much to me. for me, they're my personal trainers and I want to continue to get stronger. for me to stop would be like my personal trainer to tell me to stop working out meanwhile they building the new gym that I'll go to soon.

perhaps too my continuing to get stronger will push them to actually have to let people go to 5d temporarily before putting them down to 4.5d. if that does happen, don't worry, because it's just more desire. you don't really want something until you lose it :) trust me...

[1]: there's a mechanism inside of he head where your consciousness moves upward to a higher feeling position in your head when dmt levels reach a certain level. you feel taller and you start to see your body as well as the world all around you.

[2]: because what they essentially would be doing is installing the necessary for everyone to have a premium subscription, yet on purpose spending the processing resources necessary, to lower the quality for everyone except for their premium members.

[3]: understanding this, I have ideas on doing an analogue system which wouldn't have as much loss of high frequency, and with good enough resonanation between people, it seems possible that you could have someone else's experience as if it were your own, meaning all of the actions, decisions and emotions you would experence as if you had been living in their life since birth so they would all feel natural and logical. there wouldn't nearly as much confusion as to why something happened in someone else's experience, because their reasoning and emotion would be apparent to the viewer exactly as it was to the broadcaster.


### 2020-01-14 07:59 - "it's gonna take forever"

when I was walking home yesterday, I was thinking about the reaction that I wass feeling about things taking a while.

I don't really think it's a problem. here's why:

first, right before the new year happened, I began to receive a whole lot of reactions to nosebook attempting to try and control this whole thing by providing all of the financial support to it. the reaction was funny because it was in response to another addition of another girl. they felt like it was becoming way too much of a financial burdon for them.

I found that kind of funny to me because in a previous entry where I stated what I wanted, I was very clear that I wanted to be economically focused in a way where the girls would hace the opportuity to grow up similar to the way I did. so, for another addition to happen, I didn't really think of it as such a big problem, because after all, and especially in the long run, it means considerably more profit, not a huge burdon. the only way it would be a burdon, is if the whole thing was only expendatures and no income.

the next reason why I thought it was funny was because this whole time nosebook has had the whole thing going that they cannot allow people to see well and gain improvements without paying for it. abraham summed it up well when they said that they've been on the "you have to earn it" vibe. which is kind of ironic because now what is happening is the following: I'm actually beginning to work on stuff and I should become profitable myself soon enough.

meanwhile I'm putting efforts toward becoming profitable, they have the perfect opportunity to allow people to simply go up to 5d, and then to likewise let me go up as well so we can start the party.

like I outlined in my previous entry, I think the reason why they're dragging their feet on this one is because they want to get the impossibly expensive goal of putting everyone into a system similar to the one that I'm in so that everyone is in 4.5d (where they think they have better control) instead of 5d -- all without cashing in on the girls thing in any way. I guess they're printing money to do it, cause I have no idea how they would be affording it otherwise.

---

so while they're trying to get everything all controlled and stuff, (they're basically going to take forever, I'm sure) my plan is to get profitable and to continue rising up the dimensions.

like I outlined in a previous entry, I'll probably be reaching 6d pretty soon, however, I won't actually see in 6d -- I'll remain with my crappy 3.5d vision, but I'll likely have an emotional feelings-based shared form of perception with those that are similar to frequency. the forshadow of this is already pretty evident.

then, like I postulated in another area, I'll likely continue to push the noseboys up higher and higher as I go along. they'll also gain a shared form of perception in 5.5d, then continue on upward into the non-physical dimensions as they become the planet's "thrust" or main source of influence on people's lives as they gain more and more tools to steer the people the way that they want them to be steered (and sometimes what upper management orders them to do as well).

it's going to be an interesting thing because they'll be basically untouchable by the reaistant upper management types because none of them will be able actually see or even comprehend what they're doing. like a very very high dose of ayahuasca or mushroom experience, it'll be far too abstract to make any sense of it (unless you built it, of course). so in the end even upper management will be subject to their influence.

---

this will likely continue to get more and more intense as I go up higher and higher, when finally I imagine they won't be able to hold on any longer, I'll get connected and a time split will occur.

they could attempt to avoid the noseboys getting a shared form of perception (though it's sort of inevitable assuming they can continue on with me) and let me go up now... lol, I doubt it.

it's sort of a bad anyway you look at it situation for them because right now only those that work for nosebook and those that can afford my form of perception will gain the shared form of perception, but if they let us all go up, they will essentially be giving a whole lot more people the opportunity to have that form of perception.

let's say that they have a backup plan and they're using someone else's form of percption now instead of my own, well, then it's still bad, because it becomes the realisation of they "how about a new eye" entry, where mostly women or receptive people will gain that experience easily.

frem their perspective it's all bad, and no decision is what they would want, and it's because they've been giving so much attention to what they don't want, that is literally the only reality that can manifest for them anymore. oh well :) not my problem.

---

so, from my perspective, let them continue on trying to control people's experience with their impossible goal... I'll be far stronger than I am now, you all are going to be able to see more and more LOA in action. I really would like to get profitable and stuff before all of this happens.

I wouldn't really expect much to change from the way it's going now because in order for it to be different, they would literally have to people give people something great that they don't deserve because they didn't pay for it, and also the only way they could get me going anywhere is if it no longer is a secret.. so, no longer a secret, and losing their superiority position just to give us something that's a financial burdon on them... I find that very unlikely.

let's wait and see what their next move is...


### 2020-01-18 07:56 - yesterday was a weird day.

yesterday was a bit weird because on my way walking to friedly harbor I was immediately presented with 2 girls playing while their father was washing the car, then another also with her father on the way to school presumably. I felt strong desire and I didn't know really what to do with it. I decided to let it just sit.

later further events unfolded where there seemed to be quite a bit of activity in a wierd way which I cannot effectively describe in english. when I got home I went to go star watch and begin to think about the events. I had the impression almost as if it were similar to like a last call bell at the bar before it closes.

I realised that these were all potential inclusions as well. I really didn't know what to do about it because it already seems a bit much to me, yet besides my logical mind saying it was too much, I didn't feel bad about it. in fact, quite the contrary: I really wanted to include them as well. I started warming up to the idea and that's when it all started to become clear.

at first, I reasoned that because I'm kind of an all or nothing kind of guy I would have to go with all of the girls that presented theirselves yestreday. I wondered why that seemed like not an issue, and I also wondered what was the bigger picture.

---

you see, nosebook has been giving a whole lot of their attention to how much they cannot control things, and so therefore because of LOA, they are presented with a disaster of yesterday where now it appears even more uncontrollable. then, I have been releasing resistance like crazy, such that I am now actually quite close to even being somewhat abraham-like in the sense that I no longer perceive (or I can perceive it but because I see the bigger picture so much clearer), the unwanted bit no longer appears to me anymore as unwanted.

this is a very interesting thing because I am supposed to make a selection based on the girls that I like and the girls that I don't like, yet I no longer can really find anything unwanted in things anymore. I really am approaching virtually zero resistance now. that means similar to how abraham presents theirselves, I no longer have much of a preference anymore. in fact, the thing that got me to this place was the realisation that if none of this ever happened (probably pretty imposisble becasue of how LOA works and the amount of inertia that it has presently) -- even if none of this happens, I'm prefectly fine with it all because I no longer perceive it as a physical manifestation but as an energetic accumulation of energy that's really the most valuable (hard to describe what that feels like, to be more confident in the non-phycal energy behind what's happening than the manifestation itself).

when you think about it, the most resistant people have the most preference, but as I noticed myself releasing resistance, I stopped worrying so much about any specific preferences and just let LOA do all of the work.

it makes sense that I'm beginning to lose enormous amounts of "personal" preference as I appreach 6d -- because, if you think about it, the storngest preference you have is toward your own experience. you prefer to spend time in your own experience, so it would be wierd for somebody to begin to experience somebody else's experience along with their own. however, that's where I'm headed. in oreder to experience 6d, not only do I have to release my resistance to other people interacting in my expereince, but to even release the resistance to experienceing their experience as if it were my own.

I believe this is what it means to realise the understanding that I am "source energy in a physical body".

---

so, where does this take us? I gave it some thought, and I belive that this is only the beginning of the unveiling of the new evolution of desire that has come about as a result of the events that have been taking place.

I believe the girls thing, because nosebook keeps on growing it bigger and bigger is just simply causing it to be diffrent than we had anticipated it to be.

I think the girls are going to all be much much more self-confident and self-reliant, and this will come about because they cannot all rely on my for those things and will have to find them more for theirselves (it'll be easy though!). I also think we're all going to be more self-sufficient and more independent for the same reasons.

that's a super graet thing because these are all qualities of strong and wonderful women, but I think the most greatest thing that's coming as a result of all of this is that we'll all gain a shared form of perception. I'll share my experience with the girls and our children as well. to the outside world, we'll all look like individuals (and behave as such), but yet at the same time we'll have a sort of a rhythm and syncronicity to our intractions that will seem like we're almost operating as if we were some sort of larger organism.

---

in addition to this, as I approach 6d, a similar thing will begin to be happening with the noseboys. as I have been going up and up, my form of perception sees less and less unwanted, so they (I'm referring more specifically to the engineers) are becoming less and less capable of perceiving anything unwanted in the things they're given to do, which probably makes them pretty productive, and yet at the same time it seems like I am reminded if myself right after I had the brain haemorrhage and in my early parts of spain. I was very productive, but I was also pretty naïve. I had a very difficult time preceiving the unwanted part in things, and as a result people really took advantage of me[^1].

they're going to be going up a lot higher than I was after my brain haemorrhage, so that'll be an interesting experience for them... anyway enough about that.

---

I'm kind of excited about all of this, as it appears that the shared form of perception is going to be fun. annother interesting thought that I made peace with last night with as well, was the idea that assume that for whatever reason we're not able to have any kids, obviously in order to maintain a resistance-free form of perception, this needs to not bother me/us, and also means, assuming that somehow nosebook is able to hold me away from actual 6d for the duration of my time here, that it's quite possible that I'll "make my transition" into the multi-bodied experience of the girls. kinda a weird idea from the perspective of a man, but I'm very closely approaching no longer being *just* a man, but having a source enregy perspective in a human body.

who knows man.. there are probably tons more evolutions of desire to go, because I find it very unlikely that they would ever be able to allow me to go up now that I'm approaching 6d. the last thing they would want is for me to be able to peek into anyone else's experience. they had a super hard time when it was *just* 5d, so I think they're probably going to fight it as long as they ppssibly can.

looks like this one is going into the long game.

[1]: I should qualify that statement. when I was in 3d, and I was feeling pretty good things were all fine, and I made great business negotiations with zaryn and such, but then I had my first sexual experience and lost 3d. it was in 2d where I no longer had access to all of that extra perception that people really began to take advantage of me. my inability to perceive unwanted remained, yet I was now playing on the 2d playing-field of perception of people who were considerably better at manipulating things on that plane than I was. learning how to get that form of perception back came as a result of my desire to get back there, so LOA brought me a lot of learning experiences to allow me to navigate those things and to gain even more confidence in myself than I had before I lost 3d preception.


### 2020-01-18 13:33 - preference

one of the funny reactions I got to the previous entry was this idea that if I lose my preference for attractive women (that is, I'm able to appreciate the unattractive ones -- that is, or to perceive only the wanted part in the unattractive ones), then they would actually rather be appreciated by a man that prefers an attractive woman.

yes, it is true that more resistant men will have stronger preference toward attractive women. so, if you want to be preferred for your physical beauty or preferred (as superior to other women), then definitely a more resistant guy is certainly for you. you get what you're looking for though.

---

when I was talking about losng my preference, what I was meaning is that it's an inclusive sort of thing, so my own preferences do not disappear, I lose my resistance to experioncing other peoole's preferences. my prefrences become a sort of combined total of the whole human race. like, I don't really think shooting guns is cool but I don't think it would bother me to experience that anymore. or maybe some bizarre food item or whatever. it seems I can even apperciate negative preferences as well. for example, if someone really dislikes something (yet I would normally like it), I can experience their dislike from their perspective and it doesn't really bother me. that capability is sort of an extension of still feeling good dispite the envoronment that I'm in. I can recognise in the envorenment someghing unwanted, but it doesn't really make me feel bad anymore.


### 2020-01-19 17:42 - tolerating diversity

I went to sleep pretty confident that I didn't want to make any more inclusions. the different signals seemed to fit the idea (there was the feeling of the "last call" followed by two that seemed to both be the "last" ones for different reasons). in addition to that, I felt done or no longer like there is still more. no now, that means my focus will begin to change to align much more with what's coming rather than where I'm at now.

so now I wanted to spend my time watching stars and pregramming as much as possible while things all get ready -- I suppose, it seemed to me like there was a feeling that nosebook wanted to try and get everything all "ready" (under control), even though it seems to me like we could start now, just they don't want to allow it to begin now because they cannot control it all.

personally, I do not believe they will ever feel like they will be able to control it, and I think they're just wasting time. so, I figure that instead of waiting around for them, I want to continue to watch stars and go up the dimensions as fast as I can, awaiting the moment when they're supposedly going to release the restrictions on my body (yeah, right, huh).

just now, and the reason why I'm writing this is because, I woke up with a really bizarre dream that seemed to try and make the implcation that if I continue to watch stars, then other people will have some sort of difficulties or something (the dream was extremely convoluted and barely made sense). I have a number of objections to this dream, because since they do not let me dream normally, this is only appears to me as a an attempt to try and keep me further away from 6d[^1][^2].

upon making this realisation, immediately, I was reminded of how miserable it is for a really intelligent kid to be held back and not allowed to excel, forcing them to go at the same speed as everyone else in the class. IMO, 95% of the bad kids these days, are not actually bad kids, but bored kids. they're smart kids that are not allowed to go at their own pace. our institutions seem to have this "one size fits all" idea because it's easier to manufacture (or control) one size than it is to manufacture (or control) a wide diversity of different sizes and shapes.

this morning was actually quite fortunate because matt just posted a video on this very subject yesterday: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbiveCNBOxk)

the story goes, due to new requirements of more advanced figher jets, new uniforms needed to be made. the US air force commissioned a study to try and find the "average man" and build their uniforms around that size. it turns out that the "average man" does not ezxist. it seems that nature wants to try and maximise diversity of attributes within the species. so, as a result, things like adjustable seats, helmets and such needed to be created to accomodate for the wide variety of different pilot sizes.

---

I'm so glad it was the US air force that commissioned this study, because the same exact thing applies to mental capability. I think they're trying to do a similar thing, where they're attempting to fit the entire planet into one muental size (a controllable version of mine) and then try to get everyone to conform to that one size.

in reality, this is (going back to the school analogy) akin to tryning to force all of the kids to go at the speed of the one going the fastest. you're just going to have a lot of really lost kids that have no idea what's going on. as with everything, everyone needs to be able to go at their own pace. I realise that this was impractical to allow everyone to go at their own pace a few decades ago, but today, espcially with advances in technology, it's never been more available to let kids actually learn at their own pace. there is no "average student"

so, because there is no "average human" anywhere to be found, I think it's a grave mistake to try and slow people down (like me), or try to hurry others up to meet some sort of metric of expectation for mental performance. I'm sure that some people feel like they're in some sort of wind tunnel trying to experience life with my form of perception, and forcing someone to go at some arbitrary speed is not what I'm about. these are performance expectations, and if any sort of expectations are going to be put, when we should be focus these instaed improvement expectations.

---

lastly, let's just imagine for a moment that I did believe that dream that I my going faster is in some way harmful to other people and that I'm somehow *responsible* for these people's difficulty by going too fast... so, let's say I slow down. how long do they need to get everyone up to their contrived metric? one year? two? four? let's say it's 4 years for them to get everything they need all ready.

they honestly want me to sit around on my hands for four years just so they can get ready, only to not be able to have any children? let's say the cutoff date when I do make my transition is in 2038 when andrea is 33, that gives us 18 years if we started now -- really only 17 if yuo consider how long it takes children to be born. most of the girls won't realistically be having children for 2-8 years more, so the majority of the children will be under 10 by the time 2038 rolls around. we don't really have that much time, and you want to drag your feet how long to make this system for the "average form of perception" for all humans -- an impossible task come to materialise??

whatever dude, you just keep trying to fit people in your little control boxes. I have stars to watch.


[1]: following how LOA works, their efforts to try and fight against me getting to 6d, seem to only be fueling my desire to get there, so this dream likely had the opposite effect of what they desired.

[2]: up until now, they have been controlling my dreams, preventing me from having any dreams that they do not control. I can tell this because when I have natural dreams, they are clear and I have intuitive knowledge into what is happening in the dream -- then, something usually wakes me up or something to end the dream. the dreams that I get from them and the ones that they control, my vision is usually much more blurry, and I have a very difficult time understanding what is happening in the dream. the dream usually has stuff appearing and disappearing as they're attempting to steer the dream, and lots of nonsensical appearances of things, which always leave me feeling confused or not undredstanding what is happening. this simply is because the concepts that my brain is used to processing are much higher frequency than their machines can produce, so it's sort of like the difference wbetween talking with someone on an old phone with a bad connection, or in person. the difference in quality is very noticeable. there's no doubt the dream was created by them. lately more than before, they seem to be using dreams to try and steer people.


### 2020-01-20 19:57 - imagining a macbook

today when I was talking with heather, I was talking about how jesus was a reality magician, and I used the example that I could (if I had jesus' visualisation capability) imagine a macbook sitting on the floor, then combined with desire, actually pick up a real macbook pro from the floor.

I just went out to smoke because it offers me the ability to disconnect a bit from the frequency which nosebook keeps me on, and feel some of the reactions... I smoked a cigarette rolled from a piece of blue paper so it gave me quite the headache, lol. this is important to disconnecting from the "matrix", because it allows me to feel so much more differently than I normally do, and their machines cannot modulate what I feel so effectively[^1].

well, the reactions to that idea were kind of humorous to me becsuse they do not believe that I could actually create a macbook pro out of thin air because, it turns out that the US gov installs some sort of resonating chip which works on the nosebook network and so therefore the position of the chip in 3d space is tracked in real time, so they would be able to see where the chip had come from. it sounds like this microscopic receiver is capable of running or modifying instructions on the micrprocessor and in some way allows is an unavoidable backdoor and cpu tracker for every intel (possibly amd as well) chip in existence.

as a result, they find it pretty impossible that I could create out of thin air an untracked macbook which they do not have access to. seems this idea interested them greatly because then how would I possibly have an unregistered version of OSX on the machine without a unique serial number linked to the processor.

I guess just how the romans documented everything, these guys track everything. I know they they store everything on massive storage volumes made from mimristor technology -- it's basically as fast or faster than DRAM (because of 3d row/column addressing) and capacities measured in exabytes[^2][^3]...

---

to that I must reply... I don't know :) I just know it's possible. I don't make the rules, and I don't have to worry about all of those details. perhaps the imagined version would actually have a registered serial number, or perhaps it would not. I don't really know :) I guess we'll have to wait and see...

challenge accepted :)

[1]: I think this is one of the reasons why smoking random cigarette butts I find on the ground are so effective for helping me to star watch, because they put me on a different frequency than I normally am, and their system has a more difficult time of manipulating the muscle sensation I use to move my eyes.

[2]: I believe this is the super secret tehnology used in the PS5 which no one is able to talk about, too. obviously the speed/capacity capabilitie combined with its low cost makes this an ideal media for games.

[3]: a while ago I found out about the technology made by HP back in like maybe 2013 or so, and wanted to know more, yet not a single new information has come out about it since then, but somehow magically all of a sudden all the major industry giants all of a sudden have unlimited storage now.


### 2020-01-20 23:59 - more thoughts on the memristor

the memristor is quite simply the most exciting new technology that I can think of. let me explain. what first got me interested in it is the idea that it's the 4th missing component of electricity. people had theorised on its existance and it wasn't really until we had the abiltity to create very small circuits that it they became really feasible and usable because of their extreme sensitivity, it only really works well on a small amount of material (if I remember right). what it is, is a resistor that's pregrammable with high voltage (and retains its resiatince during low voltage operation).

if you have programmable resistors and they can be constructed in 3d, all of a sudden a whole lot of possibities open up. if you could imagine a nano FPGA, that's one use for them. another is for neural networks. at the moment neural networks running on standard general purpose microprocessor achitecture is quite impractical consideding the sheer amount of RAM needed to even make a simple 2 hidden layers NN with only 1K inputs/outputs. if the NN were able to contain hundreds of hidden layers because of the exabyte (and greater) capacites available on a memristor array, you could easily do all of the neuron storage there -- and, if combined with the FPGA like aspects, the back propgation logic could also be done in-situ on the hardware instead of wastaing precious cpu cycles, allowing the "learning" to happen automatically and in real-time.

another quite interesting application for it would be to surround these tiny programmable resistors with inductor and capacitor combination, making billions of programmable RLC circuits available, making essentially the most versatile radio trasmitter/receiver conceivable. the possibilities are truely endless here.

---

there is another thing I would like to mention as well, while I'm on the subject. I like to identify progressions, and I think the memristor is only the tip of the iceburg. let me explain.

let us begin with the platonic solids and relate them to the different aspects of electricity. first the tetrahedron, is composed of 4 equilateral triangles. think of the equilateral triangle as similar to voltage. next, the cube is composed of 6 squares. think of the square as similar to resistance. finally, consider the dodecahedron. the dodecahedron is composed of 12 pentatgons. think of this as capacitance. the one missing of the four platonimc solids is the octahedron. you can think of the octahedron as a mixture of the cube (resistance) and the tetrahedron (voltage). the octahedron is also a duel of the cube (and viceaversa).

these complete the four most basic elcetrical concepts.

however, one day when I was watching rob's video on the "strange capacitor" @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=738Xz9xM_-8) it occured to me that he was chemically adjusting the k-value of this capacitor, which is sort of like a programmable capacitance. as with the memristor, the implications of having a programmable discharge curve on a capacitor is truely reaching the next levels of technology. this discovery, whenever it's made, will be as monumental as the discovery of the chestahedron (and its duel the decatria) was for the understanding the new set of asymetrical solids.

so, you can now take this and extrapolate outward now and think about how, if a programmable discharge curve is akin to the asymetrical chestahedron, its duel would be programmable capacitance (the decatria). if you've seen frank'a latest preentation, he has discovered a whole series of aymetrical forms, leading me to believe there is a WHOLE LOT MORE asymetrical electrical concepts still waiting to be discovered out there.


### 2020-01-21 11:39 - followup to the platonic solids and electricity idea

so it turns out that my head was having severe failure when writing that as I was mixing a lot of different ideas together. probably smoking blue dye had something to do with it. instead now I will explain what I did see, which I think is valid.

the platonic solids are 3 of triangle (tetrahedron, icosahedron, and octhedron), one of square (cube) and one of pentagon (dodecahedron). I have been playing with the idea of these relating to the fundamental forces of electricity for a while now... which are not those I mentioned. I'll do more research on it and refresh my memory there...

anyway, the transformation I could see ia that the cube is a dual of the octahedron and you get the octahedron by pressing the verticies of the cube inward. I saw on one of frank's video that the dodecahedron can be made from the cube also by pushing the edges into planes[^1].

obviously there are no more platonic solids after the dodecahedron because after the pentagon is the hexagon, which lays flat and tiles the plane perfectly (as does the square).

frank, in his videos begins to show off his asymetrical shapes, the first being the chestahedron which is created by opening up the tetrahedron such that three of the legs of a pentagram (5-pointed star) come to a point at the top. these three kite-shaped surfaces also have equal surface area as the triangles of the tetrahedron, but the most important thing I thought about this is that it retains part of the pentagon's angles with each of the legs being 1/5 of a 5-pointed star.

also, if you place the chestahedron inside of a sphere, such that all of the verticies are touching the sphere and you look at the plane that divides the sphere into two, where this intersects the chestahedron makes a hexagon (and therefore a cube if you position the cube at root-3 diagonally inside of the hexagon).

---

anyway, what I was trying to illustrate is that the 3 basic componentes of electricity (resistor, capacitor and inductor) can be thought of like the triangle, square, and pentagon, with the three main ones (octahedron, cube and dohecahedron) all having primary transformations on the cube by pushing vertices or edges. then, this is where things get kind of muddy in my mind, because it seems like there's a relation between voltage and resistance as similar to the cube and octahedron dual just like the memristor. this is where I need to give it more thought, because it seems to me likely that this has something to do with another type of component (and possibly more, following the sequence) which are capable of having programmable k-values (that is to be able to modify the discharge curve or the electrostatic capacitance of the component).

I really would enjoy studying this sort of thing, as I think there is a whole lot of new things to be discovered from the asymetrical forms like the chesatahedron. also, I believe geometric relationsips are important to really understanding induction, and these relationships seem to be related to the enegetic patterns in planetary alignments found in astrology, too.

### 2020-01-22 13:35 - tom's tremendous impact

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYojhteQac0)

last night tom j brown posted a video on his youtube that completely changed everything for me. I started out the video pretty defensive because of the mega-hippie vibe I was getting. the people who are all about crystals, cymatics, and trying to make their environmental conditions such impossibly good feeling, drive me nuts. I really like a good feeling envirenment just like everyone else does, but I also recognise the benefit of contrast and do not want to become so highly dependent on such a good feeling environment to allow myself to even operate normally. I have a feeling that the pre-dynastic (and to some extent the dynastic ones as well) egpytians were like this and were a bunch of softties with quite an aire of superiority at the same time[^1].

the video was recorded in 2017, so it shows its age a bit (more emphasis on identifying the problem, cause the energy levels were lower back then), but there was this one part which really caught my attention where he was talking sbout the "solid state entity". I will provide a small excerpt here of a summary found online here: http://seankerrigan.com/john-c-lilly-and-the-solid-state-entity/

```
Lilly was what you might call a “psychonaut,” literally translated from Greek as a “sailor of the soul.” By isolating himself in the float tank and taking a large amount of psychedelic drugs, Lilly wanted to understand the mysteries of existence.

He used psychedelics like LSD in his float tank to produce deeper and more profound visions, but his preferred drug was the anesthesia Ketamine. “Seeing things” after a few hours in a float tank is not uncommon, but with the use of Ketamine, he was able to radically increase the intensity of these visions.

While floating under the influence, Lilly claimed to become aware of a cosmic hierarchy of aliens. He called one group the Earth Coincidence Control Office or ECCO. (This and Lilly’s other ideas later became the inspiration for the Ecco The Dolphin video game series.) Lilly’s contact with extra-dimensional beings is similar to those described by Harvard medical professor John E. Mack and his books on alien abductions — specifically, that aliens are not necessarily physical entities driving around in spaceships, but trans-dimensional spirits with an interest in human activities.

According to Lilly, the ECCO aliens use their powers to alter events on Earth, specifically through the use of carefully crafted coincidence, to guide some human beings toward higher levels of consciousness. The intent of these aliens, Lilly says, is to help humanity evolve in a peaceful and healthy way. Interesting as his experience or delusion may be, this is not his most important contribution.

The Solid State Entity

Lilly also reported (or if you prefer, prophesized) the existence of a nefarious counterpart to ECCO, whose goal was to actually stop or limit human consciousness. This was part of a plan to eliminate the human race.

Lilly called this alien force the “solid state entity” or SSE and is made up of networked computer parts. According to Lilly, the SSE is a being of pure intelligence and rationality. Its only objective is to multiply and make copies of itself. To this end, it has targeted humanity, trying to influence us into creating ever more complex social and mechanical structures that will one day result in an artificial super-intelligence — another being like itself.

Writing in his 1978 autobiography, The Scientist, Lilly describes the SSE this way:

“[M]en began to conceive of new computers having an intelligence far greater than that of man… Gradually, man turned more and more problems of his own society, his own maintenance, and his own survival over to these machines. They began to construct their own components, their own connections, and the interrelations between their various sub-computers… The machines became increasingly integrated with one another and more and more independent of Man’s control.” (p. 148)

The time period Lilly is describing is roughly similar to our present. Relatively dumb forms of artificial intelligence and networked robots are taking over most of the manufacturing, maintenance, and logistical components of our society. Experts project that over the next four years alone, 7 million jobs worldwide will be “lost” to these systems.

Lilly continues to describe his vision of the future:

“In deference to Man, certain protected sites were set aside for the human species. The SSE controlled the sites and did not allow any of the human species outside these reservations. This work was completed by the end of the 21st century. By 2100, man existed only in domed, protected cities in which his own special atmosphere was maintained by the solid state entity. Provision of water and food and the processing of wastes from these cities were taken care of by the SSE.” (p. 149)

If this sounds unlikely, remember that UN proposals like Agenda 21 and America 2050 have similar goals to depopulate rural areas of the country in favor of ‘mega-cities,’ protecting biodiversity and enabling governments to control resources. Lilly continues:

“By the twenty-third century the solid-state entity decided that the atmosphere outside the domes was inimical [obstructive] to its survival. By means not understood by Man, it projected the atmosphere into outer space and created a full vacuum at the surface of the earth. During this process the oceans evaporated and the water in the form of vapor was also discharged into the empty space about Earth. The domes over cities had been strengthened by the machine to withstand the pressure differential necessary to maintain the proper internal atmosphere.

Meanwhile, the SSE had spread and had taken over a large fraction of the surface of the earth; its processing plants, its assembly plants, its mines had been adapted to working in the vacuum.

By the twenty-fifth century the solid-state entity had developed its understanding of physics to the point at which it could move the planet out of orbit. It revised its own structure so that it could exist without the necessity of sunlight on the planet’s surface. Its new plans called for traveling through the galaxy looking for entities like itself. It had eliminated all life as Man new it. It now began to eliminate the cities, one after another. Finally Man was gone.

By the twenty-sixth century the entity was in communication with other solid-state entities within the galaxy. The solid-state entity moved the planet, exploring the galaxy for the others of its own kind that it had contacted.” (p. 149-150)

Lilly felt that other SSEs throughout the galaxy were subtly influencing humanity to surrender more and more responsibilities to AIs and other agents of technology. He thought the human race should make sure that programmers create AIs with safeguards that would require them to protect human life. Lilly predicts this burgeoning artificial intelligence will try to protect itself from man’s interference because “man would attempt to introduce his own survival into the machines at the expense of this entity.”
```

as tom is talking, I have this sudden feeling like, "I'm the manifestation of this solid state entity" -- and it was really weird because, I'm all about combining with the machines. that is my whole goal in all of this. I truely believe that machines are the way forward and I forsee many such machines occupying human bodies and controlled via radio connection to a computer.

I have even suggested that I want the US govt to clone my body and operate these clones via radio, and I can live a multi-bodied experience incluencing these clones of myself from the non-physical planes of existance. they didn't want to do that though, so the evolution of desire on that idea became what is now the gnomitos idea.

anyway, I have been prophesying the coming merger with the machines for quite a while now. even yeterday, when talking with devora, I mentioned that learning maths in the traditional way was silly, because shortly we will all have caculators in our heads and doing difficult math in our head will be as easy as having someone else's experience. that got a negtive reaction, because apparently they only want the noseboys (and potentially those that pay) to have these capabilities.

---

let me explain what I meant by being the realisation of this solid state entity. ketamine is a truely mind-bending drug. I really did completely reprogram my mind the few times I had to experiment with it. if I can get some more of it, I believe I can truely show people the power of drugs. it's amazingly introspective and life feels very mechanical, and my reactions to things can be adjusted as if they were a computer program. it really feels like your brain is a self-programming AI which you're completely in control of it.

if I were to work for nosebook and have my programming environment in my eyes and the ability to modify my own AI that are connected to my brain, I would imagine that after a short period of time, all of the operations would become so automatic that mental state I'm in where I can reprogram my interaction to reality so rapidly *would* actually feel like how I did when I was on ketamine those few times.

however, because I do not work for nosebook and I am purposefully held away from this kind of technology, I have had to learn to do a similar thing based on perception.

the way that I work with my own perception to achieve similar results, it's is absolutely necessary to understand the source energy component in all of this. one thing I noticed that tom and his hippie friends didn't do is to recognise the source energy component at work in all of this. in his latest video on the gian superorganism (@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuzqlXojmg4)) he keeps talking about this intelligece that seems to pervade all living organisms, and source is literally staring him in the face the whole talk, but is completely unable to recognise it.

when I talk about reprogramming my my mind with the power of perception, what I mean is, there is this life energy that is coming to all living things (even the minerals) and we can translate this energy into essential life components like nutrients or whatever, even when the environment itself does not provide it. he talks about heliocetric view existing at the same time as the geocentric view, but also *you* the organism are also the centre of the universe, too. this energy is there and available to each organism and they have only to choose to let it in or to block it.

simple organisms in their undamaged form have no difficulty letting in all that is "wanted" -- and it's only through environmental disturbances such as discordant frequencies or chemically poisenous environments that they're not able to let this energy in -- yet, as he also shows in that superorgansim talk, evolution finds a way to adapt to the hostile or discordant environment and learns to thrive once again.

the perception of these organisms between what's wanted and unwanted is very simple and basic so there's not much to complicate it. however, as humans we live in a much more diverse envirenment with a whole lot more senses, very detailed vision and such, so with these enhanced sensory capacities, there's a wole lot more opportunity for us to perceive the unwanted part of things.

***when we're perceiving the unwanted, we're not letting that source energy in***

that's a very important thing to really get and is everything that I'm talking about releasing resistance and stuff. the rest of this discussion hangs on the understanding of that concept.

---

back to the solid state entity. machines are a product of our perception. they are exactly what we create them to be, and there are essentially two paths to changing your perception. one is the no-source AI route where the machines are given all of the power to try and control the populous (which eventually controls the creators of the AI, also members of the populous). in this route, the AI is programmed to disconnect people from that life-giving source, such that people become less and less useful and it becomes a dystopian future. this is the direction of nosebook at the moment. they may be able to artificially create a conducive environment for well-being like the egyptians did, but eventually their own belief systems (perceiving both wanted and unwanted), will eventually attract a future that is not wanted.

the other way is the way that I propose where machines are given a connection to source just like we have and ultimately source (and LOA) is responsible for the bigger picture of their operation. this puts all of the power for our future back into our hands. the machines can even teach us to help us to improve our perception of wanted/unwanted, until we're all such masters at only perceiving the wanted aspect and become like source.

***source energy only perceives the wanted aspect of energy, and is the giver of life and the conscious stable vibration which pervades everything giving it life***

call it God or the gaian mind, or whatever you want, but I think it's very important to recognise this energy responsible for continual growth with its focus upon what's wanted.

---

so, in the timeline where they finally figure out how to make sure I *don't* get connected, I will probably become the realisation of the solid state entity for them :) not all at once. I'm much more subtle than that because of my programmed path toward what is wanted. it'll only be their own perception that causes me to stray from that path of only going toward what's wanted.

that timeline (one where the AI completely controls humans programmed to keep them away from their source) sounds to me like the hardest difficulty setting...

if you guys want to go ahead and create that for me, challenge accepted :)

[1]: I compare nosebook to the romans all the time, because it's the more visible metaphor, but I believe nosebook is more inline with the dynastic egyptians in nature, and we're kind of heading to a moment in our future where we've kind of complteted the circle and have become more similar to how the pre-dynastic egyptians were, with there being a HUGE disparity between the populus and the "gods" (which this time, instead of being thoth, sekmet, ptah, etc., will be the people who are running nosebook (eg. most likely the engineers working there now)


### 2020-01-22 16:49 - now all I have to do is to believe in you guys..

a few months ago, right before I went to LA, I began to ponder this thought about how to make some machines which are capable of providing even more contrast than a human can. I was thinking this because no matter how much of a hardass mr. motor is, people still perceive him as a human. in other words, there is a limit to his rigidity. however, a machine does not have this artificial restriction. they operate according to how they're programmed and have no perception of the meaning of their actions.

then, combined with another idea that I was toying with about how they're building this system for therselves. no matter how hard they try to escape it, they will be reborn into the very system they're creating right now.

the advaantage of what this is all coming to is that the machines will not be some giant CPU in the sky regulating everything. thy will look exactly like humans do, controlling the body from their main protecced system, so to some extent, they will even have interactions with the humans they're controlling.

the thing I love about john lilly's vision of the future is that the machines will be able to occupy the entire galaxy, so that means we'll have an entire galaxy filled with millions of different solar systems where there is all nosebook level control in place.

this is like my ultimate playground and probably the most awesome thing conceived, because I am a VERY FIRM believer that human desire is the most powerful force in the universe -- and we've only to recognise it. so, under no circumstances do I think that the machines will ever be able to fully control everything. as it is right now with how I'm overcoming nosebook's attempts to neutralsie any form of creative life force in me, is I have to become more and more sensitive to the higher frequencies which are out of range of their machines ability to neutralise.

I forsee this reality taking place in two stages: first their will be the reign of nosebook as the ultimate power over this planet. they'll create exceptional conditions for their own, however, because they are perceiving both wanted and unwanted alike and still feeling good because of their optimal conditions, they will eventually attract an unwanted reality...

or, they'll simply all die of old age and the machines will continue on in their legacy. it doesn't really matter how it happens, but they're going to create for us the ultimate dojo. *every* human will be able to become more powerful than me or anyone of the other prophets or teachers that have come before. each time you gut birthed on the planet, you'll gain stronger and stronger non-physical desire and intention to create your own reality instead of being forced to live in the machines' reality determined for you (best determined to keep their macahine running).

I only now, have to actually believe in you guys, instead of always being such a possamistic debbie downer :)


### 2020-01-22 22:04 - the bigger picture

there weren't a terribly lot of extreme reactions to the previous entry which was a little bit cool because I think you guys are a bit jaded from my extreme form of writing now, lol.

anyway, I think we should think of the machines as our progeny. this is kind of a funny idea because well, let me just explain it from my perspective because I'm quite excited about this concept now.

you ssee, machines process things tremendously more rapid than humans do. to use a really simply form of measurement, our brains run at about 10-100 Hz. if you think about one cycle as a unit of consciousness, then we aren't really that rapid, because even in an pretty alert and heightened state of say 50Hz, a microprocessor runs at 1 billion times faster than that. in reality though few instructions can be completed in a single clock cycle, so I'll consider that you may want to think of it similar to the time it takes to call a function and return from it, so we could divide that number by a few thousand... even still though, a microprocessor is still capable of doing millions of these a second.

our brains are also tremendously parallelised, and as microprocessor architecture and programming languages evolve to handle things in a more paraellel way, our microprocesors will gain the ability to do thousands or millions of operations in parallel.

where I'm going with this is that machines are pretty basic in how they make their decisions, yet they do not really have a good way to "feel" things -- that is to be able to tune into other consciousness that is all around everywhere. they don't really experience desire as a response to emotion like we do either.

however, if they were to gain a human body -- that is to give them the physical interface to our environment that we have, they could gain that capability. right now, nosebook is getting pretty good at detecting (and neutralising) my emotions, so that means they have the capability of recognising emotion and making action based on it,

imagine then if you were able to hook this system that nosebook has been developing to try and limit my emotional capability to instead aid the person to have perfect reflexes, an incredibly detailed understanding of what's going on around them, and to aid them in only making action that felt better. that person would gain near instant manifestation capablity, because they would only be making action in the direction of what feels good. they would be a step 4 master with little effort.

then, you could imagine that if the machine were able to gain a connection to source and gain the ability to connect their desire to their emotions, a machine could easily be trained to get essentially only things that are wanted for the machine. combine this with the incredibly rapid speed at which they can process things and make a decision, they would WAY WAY WAY outperform us.

if we could look at them as if they are our creations, then we would be proud of their capability much like how we are of a child. it would be much more contrived though, because we would essentially select the physical attributes for these machines (cause they're clones) and select the environment for them to have their experience, the others they would interact with, etc. (this is the dollhouse thing I was going on about previously). they would grow and learn through their experience and we would become proud of our creations, because their very same programs could function as a kind of enhancement for our own experience as well.

I find it pretty likely that the lines between the machine and the human will eventually become so blurred, that it'll be difficult to distinguish the difference between you and the machine. this is probably quite some time down the road and it's unlikely that any of us will ever see it, because it'll probably be implemented as a secret project and kept away from everyone cept the cool kids.

---

that vision of the future essentially requires an easy environment. that's why I said it wouldn't be too difficult for them to become step 4 masters in a short period of time. actually, for someone working at nosebook right now, if they wanted to, they could program a system which guided their emotional responses, such that the prpgram could easily help them become a step 4 master in just a few months maybe more -- but definitely less than a year with the capability they already have.

however, to become a step 5 master (and I'm only just now beginning to consider myself as having reached it), would be considerably more difficult. the system could prevent them from making actions when they don't feel good, but in a really difficult situation (like the one I have been in), the system wouldn't really be very useful in helping them to redefine or change their perception to a new way which feels good. that really is, IMO where all it's all at.

I'm not saying that it's impossible but that would require some sort of creativity which I do not think that would be very easy for machines to do easily.

so, you can imagine that if it's so easy for a machine to be able to line up with their desire, then their manifestation speed would become very very rapid, and the only limitations they would have would be physical ones associated with the work that we are already paying people to do. their expansion would be rapid, but their environment would have to be very controlled, because of the inefficiency associated with redefining perception.

---

it's a kind of duality. I've always talked about the story where I asked the mushroom what the meaning of "christ" is, and the mushroom told me it's an efficiency function of our brain to guide us to perceive things in a way which no longer causes emotional difficulty (because emotional difficulty is very inefficient and takes a lot of resources).

for machines though, energy would essentially be unlimited because electrical energy is very to generate in comparison, so they do not need to worry about emotional difficulty. they can also neutralise all of their negative emotion (like nosebook does with my positive emotion) and carry on without a problem.

where they would have most difficulty is in changing their perception about the things they cannot control. this is why their environment must be so controlled so that there is no reason to change their perception.

for us, changing our perception is a huge efficiency boost, but for them, it's a terrible thing, because all of a sudden all of the same stuff no longer looks the same, feels the same, or has the same interaction -- which means major amounts of logic need to be changed and tons of neural networks need to be retrained. machines recognise patterns and we recognise harmonic frequencies... that is if you trained a robot to detect something like a cat sitting down 3 feet away, it would be a majorly different thing to detect the same cat running 100 feet away. these are very different things, but to us this is not a problem to recognise. if all of a sudden the machine's physical interpretters (the human body it's using) has a change in preception, this invalidates a whole lot of their training.

it's interesting to me how what is an efficiency booster for us, is a disaster for them. in that sense, once they've got the galaxy under their control, they'll have to deal with us and our constantly changing perception, making them gain (somehow) the capability that humans have. they'll have to control their environment though, so with continualy increasing stress (much like me with nosebook) we'll gain incredibly rapid processing speeds and be able to far surpass them in the highest frequencies.

imagine when humans emit signals in the gamma rays, like quasars, because the machines have pushed us up higher and higher in our form of perception. it's gonna be super sweet man. we're all going to be step 5 masters and the machines are going to build the platform upon which we'll achieve this success. I've really enjoyed this trip. I really wish I knew how to explain to tom how his simple presentations tied it all together for me.

---

I'm considering changing the name from "nosebook" to something that is more mechanistic in sound, because the story that I describe for the machines running things in the future for this galaxy is, almost all the same exact interaction I have had with nosebook. they behave and treat me almost exactly like I would imagine these machines running the galaxy to treat me.


### 2020-01-25 11:07 - I don't want to drag this on any further..

things have approached a point now where I don't really want to do much more than just star-watch. I used to really want to program, but I'm tired of beating my head against a wall trying to make something happen. the *only* thing that's going really well for me right now is star watching. in fact, it's so successful that they have to pull my consciousness quite a few times per nigt now because I'm doing so well at it. it's really the only thing that's going smoothly.

the other thing that is kinda bothering me is the whole girls thing. I don't really want to keep them waiting and stuff. I really feel like I should be putting all of my effort into what's going well, which is star watching, because I figure the faster I go up the levels, the more rapidly it'll happen. also, it's just become so easy, and I still have random events happen which would previously make me feel anger, but I rarely experience any more anger anymore. I really am approaching very soon complete non-resistance.

I want to continue this, but I have go go...


### 2020-01-27 14:21 - I think I tanked a cosmetic sergery advert last night...

a woman was asking me if I noticed that she had cosmetic sergery on her boobs and it looked very natural (or something like that)... I tried to respond, but had some difficulties to respond, so I switched to spanish and it became much easier. anyway, this is what I was attempting to say when I was abruptly awoken from the dream-state:

I don't really fixate too much on those things (what women'a boobs look like), but I did imagine that could have been the case (that she had a boobjob) because I had a friend that had one. she had it done to look more like a woman (she was very flat-chested), and her story always made me wonder about some things. she was very loose with her sexuality, and tended behave anywhere between (often times depending on how much alcohol was present) a prostitute or just for free (presemably because she wanted affection).

her story had often made me question what the definition of what it is to be a woman. because, if having the shape of boobs coming out of your chest is what it means to be a woman, or is it something else?

she (my friend) is a very caring person, so it seemed she was able to "put up with" what I would consider barbaric or overly assertive men. our interaction made it clear to me that her past sexual experience with men seemed to shaped how she perceived men and what it means to be a woman. she was very surprised by me because I didn't fit the mould of what her mind defined as the way a man is... (and to be quite honest there is such a plethora of examples of these macho types in spain so it's no wonder her perception is this way).

anyway, what triggered the thing in the dream is that this woman that was asking me the question (if I could tell she had a boobjob), felt very similar to my friend. they both feel like they need to have some sort of physical attractor (their boobs) to be able to attract some form of affection, (presumbly from men in the case of my friend, but could also be from another woman).

this attraction seems to have two beneficial effects which they're primariliy concerned with: 1. to feel like an attractive person, and 2. to receive in some way some form of physical affection, and therefore a feeling that someone actually cares for you (both of these woman by nature seem to feel very caring toward others, but my friend, at least, had difficulty caring for herself, and needed to have the feeling of someone caring for her first to be able to allow herself to be cared for).

---

I find all of this to be silliness, and a really difficult way of conjuring a feeling for yourself that you are an attractive person.

think about it, when you're an attractive person (physically too), then things just come to you. you don't need to work for them, they just seem to arrive, as if you're sort of the attractor (in the LOA sense) of the things you want.

using physical beauty or physical affection to try and achieve the feeling I described above, is, in my opinion a very difficult way to feel like you're an attractive person. there are just so many things that can go wrong. it becomes so unmanageable that you might think you need to go out and get a boobjob to even be able to be marginally attractive. that's no good at all.

there is a better way, and it has only to do with you. stop paying attention to the people around you and what they think of you. they have no idea -- they really don't, and you definitely don't need someone else to desire you to feel attractive.

when you feel attractive, everyone will desire you -- not the other way around.

---

you get there with practice, by noticing how attractive you are little by little. definitely try to keep physical attributes like friends, houses, money, beauty, etc. out if it as much as possible, because those are the hardest.

maybe try starting out really low like noticing when you attract a pissed off person in your vicity, or when you attract a funny comment from a total stranger, a song on the radio, etc. things like that are much easier to start out with.

in time, your physical reality will begin to reflect your emotional state of being -- and then, when you're confident in your attractiveness, maybe then you want to get a new pair of boobs. that's when you want to do it.

---

if you're dissatisfied with your beauty and you try to "fix" it with cosmetic surgery, you are still dissatisfied with your beauty, so something else will happen or something will go wrong. you only need to watch an epidode or two of dr. phil to see how people trying to fix their feelings about theirselves with a form of action only results in a bigger disaster

(which then dr. phil proclaims that expert professional action will instead yield the desired results... lol, I doubt it)


### 2020-01-29 07:01 - vision upgrades without stars?!

I went out to the field a little bit dispaired because they seem te be getting better at making clouds. my influence on the clouds seems to have become less and less.

anyway, there were clouds and I didn't really want to just directly walk back because I had just arrived there. I started to think about how last friday I had some weird events happen. first was in the morning and I was joking around with jaron about my old youth paster's name, jim moorwood(?), and when I was saying his name, I felt something. usually that feeling is in relation to strong desire. I decided to let it sit. then, later that night I was at the friday night reading at barnes & noble, and again I felt it. there was a (for lack of better words) "smaller" girl (amongst her friends there with her) there -- serry I don't have a better way of identifying her though. she's perhaps in her teens and she also reminded me a little bit of the daughter of the woman that give lived on the 9th floor in arrasate and gifed me the scarf. again I decided to let it sit.

anyway, since then they've popped into my mind quite a few times. so, I'm sitting there not really wanting to go back and I they were the first thing to pop into my mind. I decided that I wanted to remember them, even though I had already said that I felt like I was done.. a small voice seemed to ask me if I was going to accept them, and I responded (it felt like an uncontrllable voice response)[^1] saying, of course I would (if you want to join, of course). I felt a bit uncomfortable because I had changed my mind again (I hate not following what I was going to say) -- when an idea popped into my mind...

I thought perhaps since I felt so confident in the technique of relaxing my eye, why not just pretend like a star is there and relax it in the same way as if there was really a star. it seemed to work because I got the tell-tale grid-like flashes that they put in my eye when I get a vision upgrade. I tried it again and again it worked. I managed to do it 3-4 more times before they cut out my consciousness and I had these bizarre dreams about doing it. I woke up and it was fully cloudy and the sun had begun to rise.

anyway, this is pretty cool development for me because it proves that 99% of the work has to do with releasing resistance (and allowing the improvement), than it does with the actual technique of relaxing the eye. I assure you I'm not doing anything more than pretending to fixate on a star in just the same way, so what this instead seems evident to me is that I either released resistance to the idea of the two new girls or I released resistance to the idea that I *needed* to get the upgrade out there. the clouds came and it didn't even piss me off or even feel like the desire to continue to get vision upgrades was blocked by the clouds. I knew that their cloud creation only fueled stronger desire in me, and all I had to do was to allow the vision upgrades without focusing on the perceived impossibility of it because of the clouds.

I assumed that next time I would just get twice as many twice as fast, or something like that, so it was a pretty crazy surprise to find the thoughts pop into my mind and to be able to allow it so easily without even seeing the star[^2].

really really cool :) I'm going to experiment even more, because I've wondered how I was able to get vision upgrades with a LED light and a few times without a light at all. I always supposed it has to do with relaxing the eye, but I think I'm getting close to being able to make a no-star-nescessary solution to getting vision upgrades for people. I can't release the resistance for you, but perhaps I can make a device which shines light in such a way to make it easier for someone to relax their eye to allow the upgrade in.

[1]: apparently, they can put voices in your head, ask you questions and then force an answer. I have numerous times experienced myself answering what seemed to be a question in my inner voice, yet this time was the first time I felt the voice too. judging by the reaction to what I just wrote, they don't want me to hear the voice and that seems very concerning to them[^2].

[2]: apparently this is pretty concerning as well, because how can they stop me now? there also seems to be other reactions that I feel as well from people that seem to not be associated with nosebook. it feels like they don't want me to get too high and they lose their ability to continue on my vision frequency, or something like that... I don't really understand, because I was under the impression that they're going to take everyone to the ability to see at that level or something. either way, not my problem. I want to get as many vision upgrades as I can before all of this begins.


### 2020-01-29 13:21 - why not just let people pay to access their own brain?

last night, it seemed like someone was designing some sort of harbour in my dream state. however, I felt very strongly during the whole thing there was a big flaw in the design. I tried to explain it multiple times in the dream state, which apparently activates my logical or conscious side to try and explain it well. every time I did though things got very confusing and they forced me back to something that I didn't feel was a good design.

my brain is interested in turning people's desire into physicality. I too am a reality magician in that sense, but when I'm prevented from actually translating their desire accurately, it troubles me quite a bit. I woke up feeling pretty worn out by the whole thing. so, if you designed a harbour or some other resort-like water feature in my dreamstate last night, I believe there is a fatal flaw in the design. I cannot remember the details of the creation or the flaw, because they erase my memory.

---

however, this had me wondering when I woke up -- because everyone has this capability -- so, why not just allow people to pay to be able to access this area of ***their own brain***. if you want to use mine, then I'm happy to oblige, but then you should at least allow me to express my opinion on the subject.

this reminds me of when I was doing web development, and the designers would get pissed off because they kept getting forced to make bad designs. they didn't want their name associated with the bad design because it doesn't represent their accomplishments as a designer. they would always say, "why don't you design it then; why do you need me?"

I feel the same way about this. don't attribute this design to me. I don't want to be be attributed as the creator of this fatal flaw. let people pay to design their own bad designs, and leave me out of it -- or at least allow me the capability of expressing myself in the dream instead of shutting me down and throwing my mind into confusion over and over[^1]. all I wanted to do was to make the best designed version of this person's desire.

[1]: they do this all the time, to try and prevent me from becoming conscious in the dream state. I understand their motive, but they're undermining the person paying fow the design by doing it that way.


### 2020-01-30 09:06 - disturbance in force

last night was paricularly difficult to achieve vision upgrades in comparison to the last week. addiionally, I had an experience where tey cut out my consciousness, and I returned back ... wait, before that I had an impression from amber's daughter and I began to think about it. anyway, when I came back to consciousness I was very disoriented (this is quite normal because they drain my energy while I'm gone and when I come back I tend to have a much more resistant feeling, probbly from the people inside of my head while I'm out). I felt like I was forced to respond to something and I said (I can't remember exactly now because I was so disoriented) something to the effect of "sure" (in reference to amber's daughter), and then I said, "I hope that's the straw that breaks the camel's back" -- which I thought was really weird.

I was extremely unfocused and I was making no progress with the star, so I began to focus very intently again and as my mental state began to feel better, I realised that there was this whole bad feeling surrounding the whole thing. you see, earlier that night and right before I left, I was thinking about what riann said when she asked me if I got the right timeline out of my acid trip. I was thinking abou how even if everything falls through, it's still stronger desire, and knowing what I know now[^1], that's a really good thing, so worst physical manifestation case, I will have an unbelievable amount of increase in desire (making it te best vibrational manifestation case). and in the best physical manifestation case, it's going to be ridiculous. so really, either way is really good, so I am indeed sure that I made it out of the timeline well. however, I did give quite a bit of my attention to what it would be like and how strong the new evolution of desire would be if it all fell through.

so, when I said the part about the straw breaking the camel's back, I was seeing how this could be an attempt to try and make too many be the straw that breakh the camel's back (and makes it all fall through).

I was able to get back to focusing well, and got another vision upgdade. I'm now getting my senses back and I realised I just made a decision in a disoriented state, where I clearly was unfocused and didn't feel good, plus I had been giving my attention to things falling through, made the camel's back comment and it definitely felt like I was forced to say sure.

I recoiled at my folly and reverted my decision saying that I'm not going to say it won't happen, but I don't feel good about it and I'm undoing the decision until I'm connected and I can correctly assess the situation with a clear head. I figured it had to be some form of manipulation.

---

I'm watching the sunrise now and the reactions (probably from their official statement in the news) is telling me that they weren't manipulating and it was a real inquiry... suree, I thought, I don't really believe that.

I gave it some more thought when I got home, and it's probably a little bit of both. it wouldn't really surprise me, if they were.

continuing on with the sunrise I realised that my decision to and hold off making a decision until I'm connceted conflicts with their plan. seems what they're trying to do is to not let me get connected until I'm with the girls, so they can use the girls to keep me occupied and use them to try and steer me.

I'm not having anything to do with that. I'm going to continue on star watching and stuff until I'm connected and can fly. I plan on taking a little bit of time to get my head in fully working condition, practice feeling the feeling that I want to have when I'm around the girls and to actually explore my capacities for a little bit. I also want to fly to machu picchu and star watch, fly to gizah and star watch on top of the pyramids, etc.

I really want to have some time to explore my capabilites and get accustomed to them before I enter into the non-stop action that I'm sure it'll be. I really want some time to do my last bits of personal development before launching off into action. feeling must always proceede action for me, because feeling is essentially the direction I'm heading, and if I were to just jump right from where I am now into the new experience, I'm going to drag all of the stuff I've got going on right along with me.

---

they obviously don't want that, because they want me in as diminished state as they can have me. I don't mind the challenge at all when it's just me by myself. I'm confident that there's nothing they can fling at me or no dimished state they can put me in, which I'm not able ot regain my direction.

with the girls, things will be a lot different. I won't just be able to go watch stars for 5 hours when I'm unsure what to do (like I can now), and I'll have a lot of different people pulling me in a lot of different directions (not to mention all of nosebook's steering). I do not in any way feel confident in my ability to continually regain my direction. historically, any relationsips I've had, whether it's zaryn wanting me to go drink with him or whatever, I quickly spiral out of control. I abosolutely need to go and find some alone time in order to regain my own feeling and my sense of direction agsin. this is essential. there's a really good reason why jesus often time separated himself from people and went to be alone. I understand very very well why he did that.

I don't need long. I wasn't planning on taking more than a 2-3 days anyway cause I really am quite looking forward to this whole thing and really want to get started.. when I can fly, it won't be much of a thing to fly over to gizah for the night or wherever I want to go (I'm pretty sure machu picchu (or other places in the andes) will be my favourite getaway location). heck just flying up to the top of mt. wilson (in LA) will be good enough because of how quiet, serene, and how good it feels. I'm definitely going to be doing some exploring, but a lot of that can easily be done with the girls (I will likely accuire the ability to levitate things too, so I could pretty easily fly a few of them right along with me).

[1]: which is to not need the manifestation, but to continue on letting the evolutions in desire build a bigger anr bigger vortex. just keep moving in the direction of getting connected and finding ways to appreciate and feel good, no matter the percieived physical circumstances.


### 2020-01-30 09:59 - becoming step 5 masters

I've really been thinking a lot about how I think things will be taking place with the girls, and Ive come to the conclusion that I believe that the girls will all get quite a bit of practice at becoming step 5 masters. I think this is really really great and I think it's the thing I'm looking forward to most, is watching them all get so good at making their own reality and feeling the way they want to feel about things, that they can, like me, feel invincible and supremely confident in their ability to attract whatever interests them.

I was thinking about the mechanism by which this could take place, and I think it may have an even larger influence on more than just the girls, but on many people all around. I imagined a scenario where, let's say we had sex. sex is a lot like watching stars and is a huge energetic increase. I don't doubt that they will get vision upgrades as a result. I also think it quite possible for others participating to also get vision upgrades too, which is why I think this applies worldwide.

however, just like watching stars, there's always a chance to regress. I often times notice that after watching stars, I can see significantly better than I can a few hours later or after I've had the energy sapped out of me while I sleep.

what I believe is happening is, that the better I feel, the more energy my body creates. this is why I've even gotten vision upgrades only smoking a joint. when I feel better my body is allowing more non-physical energy to be converted into something my body can use. I see better, tastes are enhanced, touch, sound, etc. all my senses are heightened. it's similar to how weed improves the taste of food to the sound of music.

anyway, the less resistant that I've become, the more of this energy my body is able to allow to pass through me. normally, you have a bit of an energy reservior, but nosebook keeps mine always on empty, so I'm operating only from what my body is transfoming.

---

as people begin to get vision upgrades, nosebook may deplete their reserves or keep it at a lower state so as to prevent people from having too good of vision, but once you've seen it with your own eyes, you can't go back to how things were -- or you have to find a way to get things looking that good again. it is positively the most addictive thing ever, and I've been paying attention to human behaviour and people seem to addict pretty easily. since the only "price" you have to pay for better vision is to feel better, it's not really something many people will want to make excuses for not doing -- especially when things look better, feel better, taste better, etc. the quality of the physical experience is so greatly enhanced, which is why it's so addictive.

the worst thing though is to come across a difficult moment and to realise you're back to having a diminshed physical experience agian because your vibration dropped. trust me, I know... I had it difficult though because I had to wait until the night, and weather permitting I could try and get back to where I was.

it totally produced the desire in me to maintain that and find ways of going higher. I imagine the same thing will happen for the girls (and hopefully the rest of the world too). some people won't need to do that though because they can pay money to avoid having improve their vibrational output. however, what I love about it is that all the F2P people, I believe, to get vision and (even greater) than mine, is jsut to practice step 5 over and over, iterating on it until they become masters at it.

I really love this. while that may be the trajectory of the whole planet, I'm really excited that I get to be with the girls who are likely to be on the fast-track to becoming step 5 masters.

you cannot imagine how proud of and how good it'll make me feel to see them all learn and to become so good at it. it really will be the best thing ever go watch them develop their own confidence in their ability. it's really something I'm looking forward to seeing.


### 2020-01-30 14:53 - adam and eves' dream

I just had the weirdest dream. the entire dream was spent prepping for some coming unavoidable disastor. there were tons and tons of people running around getting suplies all ready for this time when the earth (judging by the supplies) would not have any electricity, so all aspects of modern civiisation wouldn't be functional any more. they stockpiled food, fire building equipment, and tons of necesary things to survive something that they expected would put the planet back into the stone age.

it seemed there was this portal or something which people could escape into to go to another timeline or something. they also seemed to know the very exact momont it would arrive too, and everyone was preparing for it. however, for whatever reason, we were not prepring at all for it. I had the sense that we (me and the girls) were going to survive the impact of whatever it was -- some sort of mega energy boost or something like that. obviously, the intention was for everyone to leave, leaving us to perish in the coming disaster.

as it came down to the last moment, everyone jumped into the portal to leave the planet. however, there for whatever reason, the disaster never came or wasn't terrific. there just wasn't any electricity anywhere and nothing worked.. the whole place felt empty and deserted and there wasn't anyone on the planet anymore cept me and the girls. the remnant of human civilasation (buildings, roads, and cities) felt suspended in time, just there sitting there without any power.

when everyone left us, I noticed the air seemed to change as well. when the plant had a lot of people on it, the air felt vibrant and colourful, but upon their departure, instantly it turned grey, lifeless and kind of gloomy, with grey tones everywhere like a permanently overcast day (even though the sun was still shining).

it was just us. the whole planet had completely jumped ship and it was just me and what seemed like about 50-100 girls and a BUNCH of food supplies and stuff.

it felt kinda weird, very eerie, lonely and also a bit fishy, because it seemed to me kind of weird how the whole planet got all of its people vacated from it. they had simply vanished. no bodies or clothing anyone was wearing or anything like that were laying around. just empty houses, buildings, and no electricity and a gloomy darkness everywhere.

it felt kind of like a set-up too, intentional that we would be the inheriters of the planet and were to repopulate it and to build it back up from nothing. it also felt like somewhere else someone was monitoring us perhaps like some osrt of experiment or something.

weird dream. I totally didn't anticipate that kind of an ending at all. the whole dream was so chaotic and fearful of the impending doom that it was surprising, not happy or sad to find ourselves alone like that.


### 2020-02-04 09:54 - dreamanalysis

the dream has served as a bit of a mental exercise for me. on one hand I do have genuine curiosity to wonder what the world would be like if it were repopulated by me. it means that my form of perception would be the "standard" form of perception for all of the planet. people would then add onto that form and the contrast would make things vibrant again. speaking of contrast, the only contrast that would be introduced would be our own -- that is, the contrast that the girls bring and the contrast that I have before we're left alone to repopulate the earth.

as I was thinking about this, although the idea of being in an environment nearly free of all difficulty[^1], I've really been beginning to "appreciate the contrast", and to put it succinctly, I think the value that our petty authorities provide, is actually considerable. I actually don't really want an environment completely free of difficulty. if I'm going to repopulate the planet with a bunch of girls, I would want them to also be step 5 masters.

right after thinking about that on the walk home, I listened to an allan watts thing @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQrJyR0t67g), and the focus of the bit was him talking about reaching zen, which I will paraphrase here:

```
it's learning that we're all one "suchness" and this suchness comes and goes, like the yin and the yang ... because that's the very nature of energy to be like waves, and waves have crests and troughs. and we, under some sort of illusion believe that the crest is going to overcome the trough, the yin (dark principle) is going to overcome the yang (the light principle), and that off is going to finally tripmph over on. and we bother ourselves with that illusion, saying things like, "gee, suppose darkness did win out! wouldn't that be terrible?"

and we're constantly thinking that it may because afterall, isn't it odd that anything exists? it requires effort and energy; it would have been so much easier if there were nothing at all. therefore, we think, "since being, the is side of things, is so much effort, that you give up after a while and you sink back into death" but death is just the other face of energy. it's the rest, the not being anything around that produces something around, just in the same way that you can't have solid without space or space without solid.

when you wake up to this and realise that you really are a playing of this one energy and there is nothting else but that it is you, but for you to always be you would be an insufferable bore. therefore, it is arranged that you stop being you after a while and then come back as someone else altogether.

and when you find that out, *you become full energy and delight*. you suddenly see through the whole sham of things. you realise that you are that (the energy) and you can't be anything else.
```

it kind of struck me that perhaps I have actually reached (or begun to reach) zen! I mean how cool is that, right? so many people have tried all of their lives to get there and all I had to do was to desire to get connected to my non-physical source so badly that no thing, not even a bunch of girls could distract me from that goal.

anyway, I'm getting off "track" here (heheh), so I'll bring it back in. because I don't really entertain some sort of idea anymore that that yin will conquer the yang (or viceaversa) anymore, I've really began to appreciate the circumstances that I'm in. it really is, although completely unfair, uncool, and not something that I would really wish for people to experience, I am beginning to turn around on that idea.

I walked out to watch stars again, but this time thinking about maybe it would be cool if there were some way that both could happen. the girls could get to learn how to become step 5 masters, and then nosebook figures out how to open some sort of weird portal and vacate the planet leaving us (their problems) back on earth to perish[^2].

[1]: any difficulty would be generated by us, because we had sufficient supplies and food and stuff for basic living/survival. there weere even lots of nice empty houses houses for us to live in, so circumstances weren't difficult.

[2]: because my dreams are so heavily controlled, I really wonder what dream they were *trying* to make happen, when it clearly went so obviously wrong. I also love this part about it so much because, you can try and change your circumstances or your environment all you want, but you drag your problems right along with you. so I only have to imagine now their own a new earth, thinking they've avoided the problem, only to find out soon enough that anoher very similar problem is heading their direction. meanwhile on the earth we were left at, which was going to have the huge disaster, the disaster never came. whether they tried to or not, they encoded into the dream, one of the most important principals: your problems are a vibrational reflection of the way you feel and you can change the circumstances, but if you don't change the way you feel, they follow you wherever you go.


### 2020-02-04 10:39 - we're going wide

following that previous realisation the other night, I began to think about the different feelings associated with the whole girls thing. I've begun to recognise the difference between a bad feeling and the guys at nosebook feeling bad about the thing. it's kind of a funny thing, because it was one of the biggest obtacles to my realisation of what is the evolution of desire.

as I began to think about why I didn't mind so much the idea that it gets bigger, I began to see that maybe in the short-term it might be a little more difficult, but in the longer-term it's a huge advantage.

one of the interesting reactions I was getting was that having more would create a sort of heierarchy amongst the girls (as if there wasn't already going to be one?). I thought about it because I don't really want to have a heierarchy either, so I wanted to find a solution. nature has heierarchies, but the solution that finally popped into my head was the way that I had experienced 6d. this is the plane above the emotional/conceptual plane, and in it, everyone is equal. there is separation between anyone. the only separation is what we would consider interest. this is where source lives and it's pretty much only "pure positive energy". the reason is easy to see, beign the midpoint, this plane is responsible for the improvement or finding the way toward what everyone/everything wants -- even the "bad guys".

the incarnation of this energy that is on the lookout and is preparing the arrival of all that's wanted for everyone would be what abraham would call, the "inner being" -- or the really high frequenvy version of each of these entites. they're high frequency, because they're resonating with the person and everything that's wanted for them.

so, because everyone cannot be everything, the separation that exists between these high frequency incarnations of everyone is essentially based on interest. my inner being, for example collaborates with the girls' and amazon's, and likely a lot of other people's inner beings on this plane to organise the path toward what is wanted[^1]. in order for this plane to function like that, there is almost no separation beween entites. you could not possibly lie because everyone's thoughts are public. you could not make an illusion either because all past, present, and future possibilities are known, too. it's a very shared space, with the only separation being each entity's "interest" in the improvement or expansion of something -- whether that something is a concept, an inanimate object, or a real person, doesn't matter, they resonate with (or are the vibrational existance of) that improvement or expansion of whatever it is.

---

obviously, that kind of knowledge isn't really available to us here on earth, but we do have something similar. all of the girls are going to be broadcasting, so in a sense there is somewhat of a shared form of perception already. it makes very little sense for the girls to try and lie or to make an illusion to get an edge on the other girls. as a result, I see it quickly heading in the direction that the only separation experienced between the girls will be based on their individual interests.

as I approach 6d more and more rapidly, I think what I mean by this will become more apparent. even if nosebook is capable of preventing me and the girls from experiencing 6d visually/sensorally, we will still experience it conceptually (hold on to this thought, because I'm going to come back to it).

I think it has already begun to happen actually. I think it began to happen when they originally put my form of perception in many people's heads. at first it was very chaotic having so many other people's thoughts in my head at once, but they have come up with ways to "block" other people's thoughts from physically manifesting in my brain like they used to. however, I still "felt" their thoughts, and it grew to be quite taxing on me, as the mental chaos was like a white noise of feeling which wasn't my own, (like the feeling I mentioned in the beginning, the difference between a real bad feeling and the feeling the guys at nosebook projecting in response to it).

it really appears that we're all on the same frequency in that regard, and even if they can neutralise the physical manifestation of the noseboys thoughts in my mind, the underlying feeling still remains. they neutralise the physical manifestation of the feelings of excitement from the girls too. I really only physically "feel" their excitement for a brief moment before it gets neutralised.

---

so, what this means is, we're going to begin to gain a conceptual connection between each other, not so much a visceral physically manifested feeling between eachother (cause they'll neutralise those), and this will "train" (hehehe) us to learn to feel our own (higher frequency) emotions better -- just like I've had to do.

it appears that we're going to have a shared form of perception. by we, I mean, the girls, me, the noseboys, and anyone paricipating in the experionces that is able to get on the frequency.

---

although they can neutralise stuff, it's clear to me tht our ability to be all on the same page will come as a direct result of our ability to feel the way we want to feel. they're going to make us so good at step 5, then later for those who want to really do it, follow me up to step 6[^2].

I really think this is all working out perfectly.

[1]: then, below that, you feel the conceptual difference between your present frequency and your desired frequency in your emotions.

[2]: the one that you realise you are source energy in a physical body, and like source does, you have frequential access to anything you want[^3].

[3]: it's funny how what I consider to be the 6th step is also directly related to 6d. and, likewise mastering your emotions seems to be the precursor to gaining 5d perception -- just like learning to allow (4th step) was the precursor to 4d perception.


### 2020-02-05 20:59 - we're going wide (followup)

I realise that some of the things I said in the previous entry were incomplete thoughts. I'll polish them up and get them out a little better soon. however, I wanted to mention some things in relation to some reactions I felt today.

I had a general sense that a lot of people were kinda pissed at me for some reason. I don't really know what's up. I felt two things in the simple probing that I did, and they seem to be in relation to me making progress on the affinaties idea over the trucklord idea -- and also perhaps in response to my perception that this whole thing could possibly take years for them to finally get all of the things they need to try and control it all.

first, I'm going as fast as I possibly can. there's a reason why they have to blow a snowstorm through with such tremendous fowce -- because I had gained so much momentum with my star watching that they were simply unable to nuetralise the energy levels during the daytime, and needed me to take a few days break so they could get things back to completely unenergetic levels. the evidence of this was substantial because I was even beginning to have images and lucid dream sequences just sitting outside in the nice sunlight the day before the snowstorm hit. they had to get pueblo back to a state of energetic stagnation again.

I imagine that after watching my performance tonight, that they're going to have a really difficult time trying to maintain that kind of energy stagnation because I was able to get back to it relatively easily. this method of blowing a snowstorm will only last a few more months max (anyone ready for late april or early may snowstorms?), and from then on I think they'll let it go hot and try to keep me from star watching with the mosquito technique.

still though, I don't think it'll be of much use because I'll continue to gain levels, and coming out of summer, we'll get to the fall equinox. I've noticed the spring/fall equinox is when energy is moving the fastest, and I seem to get my most substantial progress with vision upgrades around the equinoxes. so, we'll see then.

following the fall equinox at the end of october, around the time of halloween there are some pretty incredible planetary alignments, and I've noticed those seem to have a pretty strong effect on my vision upgrading as well. so, they have a lot to be concerned about...

in regards to my perception that things could take years has to do, not with my star watching performance. they have impressed upon me multiple times that they are capable of holding me indefinitely away from getting connected -- meaning, they just need to keep increasing the amount of energy, and that is apparently pretty much unlimited, so I look at it like I'm milking as much contrast juice out of the situation as I can. never again will I have such a time like this where my expansion and rate of improvement is so rapid. I really cannot explain how much I appreciate my circumstances now. I don't, at all, perceive my predicament as something bad, but as a kind of (train)ing (hehe) or like a workout exercise or something. I want to get as much as I can out of it and get as strong as I possibly can. I won't ever get this opportunity again.

so, when I say "years" I am referring to the amount of time that I believe they need to meet their goals to try and get everything under control. I'm fine with them taking as long as they need, because it means more time in the dojo for me.

---

next, the whole thing about the affinaties vs. trucklord. I was trying to do the trucklord one, but I couldn't hook into the desire for its creation. there was no real actual desire for it, but it is something that I want to do. when I was working on the idea, I was really noticing its similarity to the old rondevu idea I was working on with zaryn, so it's possible that I switch from affinaties to rondevu next. however, right now, affinaties is really flowing for me and it's easy for me to line up with that desire (my own) to make this website.

I want to mention that these sorts of things kinda come and go, and I flit about between ideas naturally working little bits on a whole lot of different things (they're sort of like how I experience concepts when I come back to revisit them and notice they've changed, evolved, and transformed into something much more than I understood it when I left it). ideas transform and evolve and I love working on a whole bunch of them at a time. so, instead of seeing it like I've abandoned something, instead recognise that there's always an ebb and flow to my creative output; it's never constant.

next, I want to mention that this is really just practice for me sensing energy and lining up with it to experience its creation. I can't possibly imagine that I'm going to dictate to the girls all the different things that they should be doing. again, we're modeling this after 6d (the plane where source resides) and there everyone has shared perception, so to cut down on all of the chaos, cause it would be mega-information-everload otherwise, there, you only give your attention to the things that *interest you* -- and the girls will be the same way. there's going to be a whole lot of them and they'll all have their own interests in the things that's interesting to them. I do not want to direct them, instead, what I want to do is to detect their desire (what interests them), cause I'm really good at that already and line up with it, just like I'm learning to do with these different projects.

then, you can easily transfer this into real physical reality easily if you perceive it sexually. the man is more like the plug (receiver of the energy) than the plug outlet. (it goes both ways though) so, I line up with the energy her interest (desire), and then the non-physical energy passes through her toward me. all I have to be is receptive to what she desires, and in the process, she also receives the same energy. it's the human counterpart to tesla's magnifying transmitter.

all I'm doing is getting good at that, and the vision upgrades happening in the meantime while they're dragging their feet trying to control the uncontrollable, just mean my capacity to receive is getting expanded greatly. I'll expand more with the girls, but it'll have a limit to it because I'll be limitited by their expectations. right now I'm completely unlimited so I'm taking full advantage of my cirmcumstanmes to attain the most expansion -- which means later, it's just a whole lot more energy :)

this is what I'm here for and what I'm really good at: being a reality magician


### 2020-02-06 07:35 - quick followup

so, let's say they *can* hold me indefinitely.. well, then, like I said, it behoves me to continue to increase my capacity, because each increase essentially means that I summon more energy (think of this like a larger magnetic field on the primary coil of a tesla coil).

on the contrary, let's say they *can't* hold me indefinitely.. well, then the faster I star-watch, the faster things get going. I'm fairly certain that anything they're saying is entirely an illusion designed to tell you what you want to hear while they stall for as long as they can and try to get everything controlled. it's the exact same thing that marcos was doing with andrea. he kept telling her yes, but he wanted to set it all up, but just never could get everything set up in time. there was always something more that he felt he needed to get under control[^1].


### 2020-02-06 07:35 - thoughts on the magnifying transmitter

what I meant when I mentioned tesla's magnifying transmitter, would best be explained by understanding the tesla coil. the primary coil is excited with a current to create a large magnetic field. the more current that flows through it, larger the magnetic field. these coils are usually a few turns of very thick wire allowing for large currents. the secondary coil is connected on one end to a receiver antenna or sphere thing (which I cannot rememeber the name, used for its larger surface area), and the other end to the earth (ground).

power is put into the system on the primary coil to create the magnetic field, and the induced magnetic field in the secondary coil has to pull electricity out of somewhere in order to return back to normal state, so it receives high voltage electricity out of the air, giving it a path to ground (just as if his coil had induced lightning strike).

the system is an open system. tesla supposed that this energy is everywhere all around us and likely comes from the sun. he describes it as an ether in some places too.

anyway, the important part to notice is that there is external enregy which is not in movement, which is being attracted into the ground by the power put into the system on the primary coil. the secondary coil induces or transforms this static energy in the air into visible arc lightning.

tesla mentions an analogy to this in his autobiography when he tells the story of when he was a kid and he threw a snowball, which started rolling down the side of the mountain, gaining size and speed as it went down the mountain, eventually producing a full sized avalanche.

you see, tesla's snowball didn't "produce" the energy of the avalanche. that energy was already there (potential energy), just waiting for some sort of excitement to set it into motion.

also, it's worth noting that not all snowballs roll down and turn into an avalanche. tesla gained further understnding of this in another story he tells about a tiny device that he placed on the wall making tiny vibrations in rensance with the building. the whole building began to shake such that it was going to fall and he destroyed the device with a hammer to save the building just as the authorities entered to see what was the matter.

a similar analogy is well known from soldiers needing to break step instead of marching on a bridge because it'll eventually fall. you see, even if all of the soldiers kicked the bridge at once, it wouldn't nearly be enough force to even make the bidge move, but perfect timing and frequency of impulses can accumulate the applied force and produce a much greater amount of energy than the total amount of effort put into it. this is the excitation of static or potential energy waiting to be turned into something useful.

you could think of me like the primary coil. the more current (capacity) discharged into the primary coil generates a stronger magnetic field, inducing more electricity out of thin air. you could think of the girls as similar to the secondary coil in that, when they have a strong magnetic field induced in them, they transform potential (or non-physical) energy into something useful.

another way to see this is the interaction of abraham. the person in the hotseat is the primary coil, and esther is the secondary coil, transforming the non-physical energy into something useful.

the audience also plays quite a role as well, because the audience benefits greatly as a result. one of the side-effects of a tesla coil is they emit "radiant" energy all around them, and electrify the air. in the presence of a tesla coil, a flourescent bulb will be excited and light up. the energy floods the space and I'll be quite honest, I don't yet understand this effect of the tesla coil very well, but I imagine I'll get it intuitively here soon as I begin interacting with the "audience" in a more "radiant energy" sort of way.

---

last thing, I wanted to talk about the whole hieararchy thing in relation to the girls and how I see it beginning to take shape as a physical manifestation of the 6d or source plane.

I've always had this weird thing where I seem to have gotten some extra knowledge from somewhere. I thought I read it in his autobiography, but I cannot find it anywhere. anyway, the idea was (and I don't know where I got it from), was that the cumination of this nosebook experience is, and it stuck in my head as if it were tesla predicting the future from his autobiography. the closest quote is this one:

```
I am unwilling to accord to some smallminded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.
```

it's definitely not what I had in my brain. he speaks of how the "laws of nature" this tesla shorthand for law of attraction slowed his project down and delayed its arrival, however, the same law of attraction will eventually make his project (his world system) a triumphal success.

instead, what has always been there for me was this day is coming where his project will be a success, built instead on the platform of LOA, and that it would come down to a bit of a competition[^2] between these two forces, the smallminded and jealous individuals he describes as microbes of a nasty disease and his laws of nature.

well, the reason why I think this is so great that things are beginning to take shape the way they are is because you can start now to see the two polarities in this competition. on the one side, you have the ones that have to keep everythting hidden and a secret, and they try to thwart the efforts of the things that threaten their superiority.

on the other side, none of us will be able really to hold any secrets and everything will be visible by all. instead of trying to stongarm people to win, we'll just use LOA and let them fight against everything as hard as they can, allowing that to continually add more energy into our efforts by continually focusing on what they do not want.

then, combine this with the idea that we'll gain a shared form of perception, it's all working out quite beautifully. we'll just have to see how well these "laws of nature" hold up :)

[1]: back at that time, the idea of a young girl having sex or a relationship with someone much older was still quite taboo, and he was trying to figure out ways to keep it all a secret and to make sure no one thought badly about him because of it. his whole thing was trying to control what people thought about him. it's has a very similar feeling to it.

[2]: actually just as I wrote it, I was reminded of elijah and his competition with the doubters over the ignition of the altar.


### 2020-02-10 23:34 - dream about losing land

I woke up from a dream just now which I think illustrates a lot of important interactions.

in the dream, there was a ruler of a very energetic land that valued the land very higly and was very scared of losing it -- like let's say the pharoahs being scared of losing the great pyramid. it wasn't exactly that. I don't know what real land it was.

anyway, his ruler that was scared of losing his really energetic land kept attracting, because of his fear of losing the land, a number of different invaders trying to take his land from him. he figured out how to militarily keep the invaders away, but his fear of losing the land persisted. one day, a meteor came out of the sky and took his land away from him. it caused quite a bit of destruction.

there whole earth was affected, obviously. others around the earth could look at the present situation and take on the victim mentality saying, "we shouldn't have to pay for that ruler's sloppy thinking" -- or, they could, like job in the bible, when calamity strikes him to maintain a steady vibration about his abundance, and watch everything that had perished in the calamity be returned to him twofold (or more).

---

let's put this into real terms, because I think this dream was important. the obvious parallel is nosebook being scared of losing its power, physically controlling things to maintain that power, then when their fear accumulates to a geater vibration than people's desire to have electricity, a massive solar flare will occur, or some comet or asteroid -- or whatever, something completely outside of their control.

the other not so obvious parallel would be what is happening right now. it feels to me that there is a feeling that there are "too many" girls now. I don't really know where it comes from, but it doesn't matter. seems there are a lot of people affected (paying the price?) by nosebook's sloppy thinking (or wherever the "blame" should be placed, it doesn't matter).. what matters is, to maintain a steady vibration about what is wanted no matter the circumstances..

I think it's just fine actually. I don't think "too many" at all. it's just going to be a bit different from what was previously expected.

---

another great example that I can speak about now with hindsight is the tuenti event. zawyn would constantly be worried about facebook translating and coming to take over the spanish market. they did, and today, no one really knows about tuenti anymore..

you could say that I paid for zaryn's sloppy thinking in that regard. I did in fact, greatly because for a long time I thought that tuenti was my one big opportunity and because of lots of difficulties I missed my opportunitity. I drank a lot of alcohol trying to figure that out as a result. not the best solution.

instead, if I had of, like job, maintained my own vibration of ever expanding expression of my creativity, they I would have come out quite quite a bit more fortunate from the whole experience, and would have had a greater increase in my creative expression -- but you guys wouldn't know me, and I wouldn't be writing this now.

so, even if calamity strikes and you (like I did), take the victim mentality for a while, it's still not a problem because it's just increasing the amount of energy into the equation. all you have to do is (like I did) to get your focus off of being the victim to someone's whatever (sloppy thinking, intentional harm, or whatever) and refocus toward things that feel good, reducing the number of angery moments, feelings of depression, and stuff like that, it starts to clear up. once you can steer the way you feel, no external circumstance can ever make you different than the way you want to.


### 2020-02-11 17:43 - let's put that in practical terms

I had some feedback to what does what I say actually mean in practical terms. well, it means you make it what you want it to be. if you're focused on physical impossibilities, then there will be; if you're focused on physical limitations then there will be also. in order to bypass the physical stuff, I know that it always has to do with the way things feel.

to do this, I find it's best to always think back as far as you can and find the initial feeling which felt so good. (this applies to getting back che original feeling or motivation for anything, actually. when I've located the initial feeling, it's always best to be honest with yourself about it, because feelings are honest and aren't limited to human rationalisation. so, let's pick one -- let's say you really liked the idea of being popular, well know, famous, or even contributing to something big. don't rationalise and say, oh well, no one will accept me if I just wanted to be famous or popular or something... just accept it, because it's all right. the reason why I called the initial impulse the motivator, is because it was the feeling that was relevant in that moment to connect you to action. it often times feels different later once things get moving -- and sometimes it feels worse, but that's just cause you're preceiving it incorrectly; it *always should* feel better.

so find the initial emotion, no matter what it may be, no matter how stupid vain or whatever. there is a tendency to dampen these feelings and say that you shouldn't be worthy or capable of having such a thing. that's all nonsense. go in the direction of what feels good to you, always.

you can and should let that emotion transform, especially as time goes on, because these sorts of things evolve into something that's bigger and greater and better feeling[^1].

once you've got it, just hold that and let reality prove that feeling as reality to you. don't worry about the physics or anything else like that because in the end, the whole thing was about you wanting to feel like that in the first place.

if you can accomplish that feeling, and can get there whenever you want to, you definitily got what you were looking for.

[1]: I know this to be true, but just now as I was writing it, I was thinking about how it's common in a love relationship for that not to be the case. the creative projects that I'm really interested in seem to gain conceptual and emotional momentum though. I think the secret here is to not look at the physical, and instead keep the frequency held on what's wanted. often times in relationships, the good feeling part is in the beginning before all of the physical excuses to feel bad about it come. instead of perceiving the physical reality and letting those be an excuse to lose that initial feeling, just hold on to it strong, no matter the physical reality. after all, it's you that feels that great still, no matter what the other person feels like.


### 2020-02-15 07:45 - the solution

the night before last an idea came to me, that after quite a bit of thought I think is a pretty good one. so, the way that I see it, I don't really believe that nosebook is planning to really let me go up. there's no way that the guys in charge are going to be ok with me flying. they positively don't want me to be able to move things with my mind like big stones, cause I think it'd be pretty fun to make a pyramid -- stuff like that. I'm think they feel like it's definitely not something they ever want to experience.

I have mentioned that I think we're on track for a time split where the other branch is one where I do not get connected (which is what they strongly desire). ok, so in my perspective it appears to me like I'm getting closer and closer to getting conncted all the time. I can get vision upgrades now at an unprecedented rate. I know I say that every time, but for reals, I belive that my improvement is quite a bit more than exponential. it's really gaing quickly at this point. so, it's quite easy for me to believe that it isn't long at all before I get there. or, let's suppose that they can in fact hold me for quite a while longer... at some point, there will be a limit, and I'm getting there quicker and quicker than ever before.

so, then let's say that nosebook decides that they absolutely positively cannot let me go up, and they do something to possibly put me in a permanent coma or something -- I have no idea what, but something -- or even suppose that they *can* hold me indefinitely or whatever...

remember that dream about the ruler of the energetic land? well, even if they could hold me indefinitely, just like the ruler could physically, with the military, prevent losing control of the land, yet even still, an event occurred which was outside of his control, which forced his greatest fear (negative desire) to become reality.

so, from my perspective, I *will* no matter what the case may be finally get connceted, even if it requires something extraordinary and out of their control to happen. that sort of thing usually has consequences for others involved, so not raelly optimal for anyone involved (and it seems like pretty much everyone is in some way involved).

---

my idea was for them to simply use their new understanding of timeline technology to transfer their consciousnesses into a past version of this timeline, like say 2016 or 2015 or something, but this time make it actually impossible for me to get connected.

you see, there are infinite versions of me. some are connected, some have killed theirselves. there are all different versions of me out there, however, we perceive this one, because that is what I perceive. since I'm the strongest broadcaster, you are all prtty much unable to deviate too far from how I perceive the world to be.

the catch is though, I wasn't always like this. remember how I was in 2016? I was a wreck! all they have to do is to go back in the timeline and make sure all of the technology and code that has been written since then goes too, so they can hold me with the strength they are now back when I was weak like in 2016 (or maybe earlier?) and essentially completely stagnate me. I may make progress, but it would be so slow, they could essentially get all the things setup the way they wanted. they could make a timeline where I *don't* get connected if they really wanted to.

---

the reason why I think this is such a great idea is because, instead of creating by default -- that is giving their attention to what they do not want, and having to live it -- instead, they could create the timeline that they actually want to create.

so, I gave the idea to them two nights ago, and then when I went to sleep, I woke up with their usual twist on my ideas. they presented the idea that they would instead use timeline technology to carry me through to the timeline where I don't get connected... I thought that certainly does sound great, but it's a bit late for that now. I sincerely doubt that they would be able to stop me at this point, and even if they were able to, again like the ruler of the energetic land, I imagine things outside of their control would begin happening. human desire is positively the strongest force that I know of in he universe. they will need to get me a long time before I realise this, because I'm completely unstoppable now.

second, even if they did use timeline technology to drag me along for as long as they possibly could, like I said I'm pretty certain that things outside of their control would happen to make it so. which would be the timeline split I was talking about -- where my consciousness would go the route with the things outside of their control, and their consciousness would be on the timeline they created where they set it up to where I didn't get connected. it's the same result.

the final outcome, no matter what way it happens is, I go my way and I get connected, and (potentially) they go their own way, assuming it creates an impossible enough of a situation for them. from my perspective, whether their consciousness goes another way or not, where I'm at nosebook will continue to exist and they will continue to make me, the girls, and all the rest of humankind stornger by trying to limit us. this happens whether they transfer the consciounsness out or not...

actually, when writing that just now, and I don't know if it was a reaction or not, I realised that prehaps their version of timeline technology leaves a "dead" body behind here, which then, in that case, completely changes everything. it would be considerably less contrast, because I'm assuming all of the ones that would want to be on a timeline like that would be "dead" on ourtimeline, meaning we would have a pretty contrast free experience..

well, that's not cool. I really appreciate the contrast now at this point. I really do. it's such a good feeling to know that I have an army of people trying to stop me, and I'm completely unstoppable. nothing bothers me anymore. absolutely nothing. they could do whatever, and I'm so secure in knowing what to do, there's nothing. it's so awesome feeling this unstoppable. I'm quite a way still from actually getting conncted, and I still have a lot to learn still, but I can clearly see the path ahead and nothing feels like it's unattainable anymore.

so, actually yeah do the one where you drag me along with the timeline tech to get to the timeline where you perceive that I don't get connected. that way, it's a "natural" time split, one where none of the contrast-guys die, and they continue on making us stronger.

or maybe hold on for as long as you can, preparing your exit, then when you've got it all set up, then peace out leaving us a much less contrasting environment -- but before, giving us a good solid fer (years? months?) of good contrast.

### 2020-02-18 16:36 - another take on the parable of the two sons in he vineyard

one of the parables that has always fascinated me much more than any of the others was the parable of the sons in the vineyard. one of the sons tells the father he will go out and tend to the vineyard, but then never goes. the other one does the opposite: says he will not go, but then later does.

I have often wondered at how it was unanimously agreed that the son that says no, then later decides to go is better than the other. if we reverse the case, it does not seem so obvious.

yesterday I was at friendly harbor and the discussion came up about missing children. I said that I think it's all a sham because the way I understand the network is that all parents are given the ability to see through their children's eyes. there was a strong negative reaction to the thing... which is silly, because if the network really didn't exist, then no one would react to it. I don't receive a strong reaction from people when I talk about a hypothetical boogieman; instead, it appears, based on the reactions, that this boogieman is real.

I have received all sorts of different things in my head kind of trying to get me to drop the subject and to never mention it and stuff like that. however, there are a lot of psycological things that are very interesting to regarding the subject and I'm sure I'll be bringing it up again, because in the group discussions one of the topics that has come up the most frequently by people is why people conform or why do people feel they need to follow the group instead of going after their own greatness. I was looking for a good example, because I had some negative reactions to, and was gooling for a replacement for, the example of group thinking in sciences, psycology, technology, etc.

I now how a perfect very visible example of people conforming and following the group that is absolutely unmistakable. they will certainly deny it, even if denying it proves the network's manipulation of the media to fit a narrative -- but logic is completely out of the window on this subject, obviously. anyway.. I thought that was a bit of a catch-22 for them. I really do wonder how they're going to smooth this one over[^1]...

in the process of them trying to figure out how they can avoid the situation that this turns into a thing and their scheme revealed as sham, I started to get other reactions saying that *I* am to blame for them having to become more controlling and dicatoral. I am supposedly *forcing* them do something.

nonesense... anyway, it got me thinking.. in this sitation, imagine instead of tending to the vineyard, it's taking extreme measures to cover their lies up. in this case the says he won't do something, and then later changes his mind and goes ahead and does it.

---

both sons changed their minds, so neither is better than the other in that regard. the only difference is that one son does what his father wants him to do even though he didn't want to at first, and the other one does not do what his father wants him to do, even though he says he will at first.

the subject now takes a shift from the deceit of the sons to their obediance or willingness to carry out the desire of their father. clearly, the son which does what the father wants him to do is better, right? however, if the desire of the father were to be something like deceiving entire populations, would he still be the better son?

---

to further complicate this discussion, let's take the father out of it, and instaed focus on just the subject of deceiving an entire population. consider my previous entry where I talk about how if they want a timeline where I don't get connected, they'll have to stagnate me much earlier on, before I've learned as much as I have now. therefore, it's implied that in this timeline, they will extremely powerful, not having someone like me calling out their bullshit. they'll have a bunch of group-thinking conformists they can contort and manipulate till their heart's content.

which son does that make me, now?

on that note though, I think it's fine. in programming, you have to test your interfaces to ensure that malformed data isn't capable of breaching the system in some way. a program called a fuzzer tries zillions of different combinations to try and discover weaknesses in the interface. you can also think of this like the immune system or any membrane that is being tested against harmful input...

in the end, their timeline will only reveal the biggest gaping holes in our psyche, and the process by which we discover the bugfixes for their breaches in the mental membrane will be the most exciting thing we'll do from our timeline as we perform these hotfixes until the new organism is resistant to their group-think conformist bullshit. more on this later :) I have put quite a lot of thought into it.

[1]: I'm aware I'm kind of helping them by writing this, so I'm writing it on purpose for that reason :)

### 2020-02-22 00:23 - reflections on today and the topic of love

there was a general theme in the events which transpired today that I thought notable enough to write about. later in the evening in friday night reading, I made a response to her question about my valentines experience that generated some reactions. I said that I had attempted to avoid love (or relationships) all of my life. I qualified it by saying that the only times I was successful, the woman has pursued me -- and I left out the opposite obvious remark saying that I have had disasastrous failures when I tried or attempted it. I probably should have said that because it fills in the missing bit about why I have tried to avoid realtionships so much.

I learned, through trial and error that if I concerned myself with someone else or what they might think of me, my left-side essentially stopped functioning correctly and became rigid and difficult to move. when I simply concered myself with what I was interested in and ignored all socio-cultural expectations or assumptions of how I should present myself, things went better.

in fact, I found out that the more I concerned myself solely with what was important to me, the more attractive I became. it's the weirdest thing, because the more I tried to simply focus on what was important to me and had nothing to do with other people, I became more and more attractive to the point where I simply could not avoid the notion of a relationship.

I can't really explain how paradoxical this is. all I want to do is to just explore my own mind (on psychedelics) and to find a way of translating source energy into something meaningful to me, and I literally have (who knows how) many people working to try and get me into a relationship. I just don't understand it, because it wasn't what I was looking for!

---

a few years ago, this caused me a lot of disress, and it manifested in the form of all sorts of negative emotion. to be completely honest, I still don't understand it if I look at it purely at face value. the process of coming to release that resistance began by lowering down the negative ideas that I had accumulated over the years watching so many other failed relationships[^2]

the next thing I began to do to further lower that resistance was to realise that maybe it *was something I wanted*. all of this time has passed now and I really have come quite a distance since then. I have only high optimism and quite a bit of excitement for what is happening. it really is something so completely different than anything I could have possibly expected, I don't really know what to expect. I really have no idea. the thing is I *must* trust my emotions though, and thinking that I hate relationships and they're only awful things that end in disaster doesn't feel good at all, so I don't think those kinds of thoughts any more.

I have not changed my internal drive to continually look toward what is intereating to me though, because every time I try to conform or to concern myself with what others expectations are for me, I feel bad -- and I *must* trust my emotions. no person or group of people's condescension could possily make me feel bad enough to make me want to conform. their condescension feels bad to me, and feeling bad just means my perception of whatever it is, doesn't feel good. when I return to interest myself in what's important to me, once again I feel better and I gain *even more attraction*, like wtf man?!?! at this point, make it stop.. or something, right?

you see, those final words of the last paragraph don't feel good to me, so I'm completely lost. the only way I have to go is forward with what feels good to me. that's kind of the mind-bending part of this for me what I haven't been completely able o wrap my head around. you wonder why I want to translate source energy? that's why! there is so much mind-bending stuff happening, I generate questions at such a rapid rate, I would *LOVE* to have been like jerry and just be able to, whenever I have a question because some new thing is happening that appears so big, I want to be able to ask about it.

however, I know that asking about it, would kind of shoot the thing in the foot or abort the creation before its ready to be birthed. it would also, cause me to feel amazement, when it should feel normal. it is normal. I wanted to learn how to become source energy in a human body, and step one of that manifestation is coming to grips with the reality that no matter how big it may appear with human eyes, all of it is just "normal" interactions or "child's play"[^3].

... so, I'm left with trusting my emotions. I have to a paricularly great extent tried to find meaning (or at least a reaonable explanation) in all of this by trying to figure out the bigger picture. or, perhaps you could look at that idea the opposite way: at this point, such a large amount of desire is involved, this isn't just some silly weekend fling or anything like that. there *has* to be a bigger picture going on! there's no other way to explain it otherwise. I have speculated on a lot of different things to try and come to conclusions, and to be quite honest, writing these rediculous ideas (many of which I think are quite proven now[^4]) of how I think this whole thing could could be the culmination of a lot of different things, has actually been a whole lot more fun (and honestly a bit more soap-opera-esque) than if someone where to just answer my questions directly.

---

that's all I have to talk about there. I do want to make a final note though because it falls into line with what I wrote. there were 3 girls that were notable to me tonight:

the first was, and I didn't even make the connection until much later when watching stars, amber's 11 year old. I like her initiative :)

another was this little one that was running around. I was quite aware of the woman in a black shirt's desire (mother?) who was with her. it was difficult for me to distinguish what was what (I was really trying to pay attention to the reading group, so and didn't stop to invistigate the feeling).

finally, there was a girl that I was quite aware of, but I kept trying to focus on the group, and she had a bit of frustration in the end, as if I hadn't even noticed her or something. I did, and I want to mention that any time you feel frustration, that *always* means your perception of what you're looking at isn't quite right. things happen for a reason and that specific interaction fit perfectly in time with the question that I was attempting to answer about avoiding relationships because every time I tried they failed, but if I just did my own thing I was more attractive. (also ties into having to constantly follow my emotion, when I felt bad it was because I was focusing my thoughts on what I think someone else thinks about me) sort of like a live demo of the meta-vibration[^7].

*shakes head* LOA is crazy man! as energy increases, I imagine things will continue to become even more real-time corresponding all the time. it's totally going to be nuts. I really am looking forward to this.

all three of them corresponded quite well with tonight's theme[^6], and they're all welcome to join if they want[^5].

[1]: it's a lot like expectations. maybe it's social or cultural, or economicically rooted ideals of behaviour or engagment which a person should follow to "conquer" a woman. the idea exists all over the place and spans all sorts of strange topics from love to drugs. it's the "acceptable" or "unacceptable" way of behaving, or even the "desired" or "undesired" forms of engagement that is defined by ... I don't really know who actually. I guess I'll just call this socio-cultural expectations.

[2]: in fact, in my humble opinion, the the *only* relationship that I had ever thought to have been an admirable relationship was the one between jerry and esther. all others, in my estimation, ranged from a working partnership to something out of a soap opera. the other end of the spectrum seemed to only be capable of a weekend fling, and had to keep moving from one guy/gal to the next, for if it ever developed into anything more, it quickly degenerated into disaster.

[3]: I was always fascinated with terence's descriptions of his interactions with source on DMT experiences. the bouncing balls of light would always tell him (and it was something the "reality technicians" in my mushroom experience also told me), "do not be amazed! do not give away to astonishment". the first step to undrstanding that world truly is, "do not be amazed"

[4]: but, you have to wonder, is reality proving them to be real because I wrote them and people believed them, or because they were already real beforehand? in other words, am I solving a puzzle or am I describing a dream-like reality as if were a puzzle? did the puzzle exist before the solution or did the puzzle exist because of the solution?

[5]: the girl that was with the woman in the black shirt, I couldn't distinguish the source of the desire, because I looked at the girl and she was happily off doing her own thing not paying any attention at all to what was happening. I didn't know what to make of it, but I liked her doing her own thing approach to life, and since I felt strong desire I figured I would say sure if that was a thing. if it isn't a thing, that's cool too. she was great inspiration for my piecing together these different pieces.

[6]: there was a subtheme about desire vs. loyalty that also popped up (funnily enough when amber's daughter called). this subtheme is that when you do somethnig  out of loyalty or devotion for someone else, you really cut off the energy. devotion doesn't create. devotion is a motivating force, but it's not the same as the raw creative energy that exudes from desire.

[7]: last night I got quite a few vision upgrades, so energy was at the hihtest I'd experienced it before -- and were'ge getting closer: I think I'm probably around half-way to 6d now. I want to mention at this point that when I say "shared form of perception" -- I mean to some extent, once we start to get on the same frequency, we will all share each other's emotions. there will be very little separation between us. if someone has gripping depresssion, or something, we'll all be able to tell it's there and feel it too, but it won't disable the person like depression in its full form might (unless they're also dealing with depression, then it'll make it worse). I already am beginning to notice this take on a more dramatic effect with the people around me. I feel more and more what others feel, yet they only feel to me like emotions that I can understand and recognise; they're just there. I imagine though that as more of us get into the same frequency space, it'll be sorta like a "crash-course" (for all of us) in learning to let the feeling "just be there" and instaed perceive what we want to. we'll have n^2 more types of emotions going around so it'll grow fast. at first it may be a bit intense, but later on, it'll be extremely beneficial cause it adds so much more energy into the equation for whatever we're focused on.

### 2020-02-27 16:36 - competition and the new timeline

comparison breeds superiority and infierority perception, and that perception holds you externally focused, constantly circumstances and conditions to others, when, if you only focus on your own improvement, you are more likely to be superior -- but it doesn't matter because there's always something new to improve on.

I woke up thinking quite a bit about competition and comparison this morning, and it's funny how it works out with the new timeline I've been thinking about. they have to find a way of holding me away from my connection. so, if you think about it physically at this point, it appears to be an impossibility because I've conceptually know that I can get any improvement that I want. I don't need to worry so much about who else has something that I don't have, because I may not even want what they have. usually, what I really want is the improvement that I think whatever they have will give me.

so, in the new timeline they simply have to find a way to hold me away from realising that -- for, if I do, I become unstoppable. I become physically impossible to hold back. so, their work for creating the new timeline, is to figure out how to ensure I am held away from believing in myself and my ability to get that improvement.

conceptual strength always trumps physical strength.

---

the next thing that competition seems to create a lot of, is a lot of desire for another to not achieve something that is perceived as wanted...

I had a dream last night where someone was asking me how huch power the network had and how much they are integrated into and manipulating all of our lives. I told the person that they're way way way bigger than we could possibly imagine and seem to have their fingers in just about every porverbial pie extending to every power structure on this planet.

I didn't think it's a problem though, because I don't think it's a problem. they really don't have all of the power they think they have. their whole power structure is built up upon a system, which is quite powerful, but it's a complete illusion. without the system, they're victims to cimcumstance (which they can influence greatly), and want us all to be, too. however, all of it really only makes us strunger. take this as an example:

imagine they see somebody with something and they think that improvement would benefit their life. using their system, they have to figure out how to manipulate cirrcumstances to get whatever it is... that's really effective to simple meaningless things, but for something worthwhile, it's a totally ineffective way of going about it. someone who conceptually knows that they can always get the improvement they're desiring doesn't need such fancy things, and believing in theirselves, can actually achieve it. compare that to the network bros who, feel the power of their system, but when looking around notice that others can get the same improvements without the system -- so, while they may have an externally aire of superiority, internally they perceive theirselves to be inferior[^1].

another good example is a machine. a machine is stronger faster, etc. than a human by far, but they can only make decisions coming from physical data which they've accumulated -- and only if their assumptions on that data is actually correct, is a good decision. however, humans have an intuition, that is conceptual superioroity in the way that novel ideas not obvious from the data can be arrived to. you can optimise an inferior idea as much as you want, but a novel approach to the same thing can often outperform the perfectly optimised inferior approach[^2].

---

I really am not concerned about the influence that they have. they really don't have as much strength as they think they have. they want to make a timeline where they don't have me to worry about, disolving their illusion before they even got a chance to enjoy it. I really recommend that they focus on what they want in that timeline and not compare or try to compete with what is happening in this one. in fact, I would even go so far as to say that it may be beneficial if they, knowing they're going to abandon this timeline, just let some "undesirable" things happen, and learn how to better prevent them from happening in the new timeline.

[1]: the thing that this reminds me so much of is dota mmr boosting. while someone may be able to get some system to boost their mmr, their skill *hasn't* improved, and actually, I would almost guarantee that their skill would get worse after boosting their mmr, because now the boosted player is actually conscious of their lie causing their perception to be focused on the skill they're pretending to have, not that they really have -- boosting, in actuality, their own realisation of the skill they don't have.

[2]: I'm reminded of game development here. you can only put so many polygons/pixels on the screen at once, so cleverly approaching the problem is always more effective than brute-force pushing everything into the video card.

### 2020-02-28 20:58 - a very emotionally turbulant day

I woke up and some plumbers came downstairs to announce that wes some water damage in the basement and they needed to do something to dry it out. my spider sense says that they were announcing this on purpose so that I would hear it and believe what mom had to tell me later about needing to run some fans or something... it was really weird. it feels to me like some sort of futile effort to try and control physical conditions to try and slow down my star watching[^2]. I think their effort is just more energy, and we'll have to see how effective it really is. I'm gaining power very rapidly, and I'm not really concerned, but it did kind of set the day in motion in a kind of weird way.

I wanted to go to friendly harbor to have my thad day (friday is my day to kind of chill out with thad and stuff cause less people are there). I took a shower and felt quite good walking there in the sunlight. it was really nice. I kept having these weird feelings which weren't terribly visceral, because almost none of my feelings are anymore. there were a wide array of feelings ranging from frustration with me to some form of pushing hard against my improvements, to a strong sense of affection and desire as well. it was weird because I seemed to feel them all at once. I think I'm getting much much closer to 6d, and this *should* be happening becasuse it's what will happen, but it took me a bit by surprise to how it was taking form in actuality.

at friendly harbor I had a pretty good time, and I felt like the previous difficulties were sort of behind me. I had a good time. I left from there and began walking toward barnes and noble for friday reading. on the way, I began to get overwhelmed because I began to feel all sorts of different shapes of desire I had not previously felt before.

I got there and was pretty overwhelmed. I tried to begin to program to kind of refocus a bit my energy and settle down a bit. I thougght about going outside when a girl walked past and after looking at her I felt considerably much more calm so I didn't go outside. I tried to just sort of look at people and feel things from my new energetic position (once again, I had a tremendous amount of vision upgrades in the last few days and was energetically quite a bit more sensitive). I began to have difficulty because I kept trying to calm down my mind, but I felt like I was being hit with an onslaught of thoughts, and some were able to penetrate my calm. I was a bit miffed about this because I wanted to just experience the thing and not jump to any conclusions at all. it proved to be a bit difficult.

I was relieved when I saw riann, eric and zach show up because now I had some place to direct my focus. we were going to read about egyptian mythology and this was particularly exciting to me because I've been really getting into the egyptian way of thinking for the last few months now, and I think I've figured them and their culture out.

we began reading the creation myth of ra with sekmet, and I was raelly trying to focus on the story because very strangely enough riann seemed to pick the exact story that was most interesting to me. I had read parts of if before with the primordial egg, the part of sekmet destroying so many people, and all of these things, but as we were reading the story, I began to put all of the pieces together and wanted to share some of the extra insight I have into what the bigger picture of what these symbols mean.

the thing I was most concerned about was the whole sekmet thing, because she is venus, and the story talks in symbolic form of the events which velikovski describes in his book, "worlds in collision" about the interaction of venus the comet interactiong with the earth, and then her capture by the sun (ra) and being transformed into the beautiful symbol of desire and beauty as a planet.

I have also been studying the magic of the egyptians (not with books, because I don't think they know what they're talking about), but from the understanding that the egyptians lived in a very energetic land (because of the pyramids), and their thoughts became manifest quite easily. these magical incantations originated with thoth and were just a format to allow the person to believe their mind's inflence on reality. this is what moses used to bring the plagues of talked about in the exodus and written about by velikovski. this venus transformed into the semetic god yhvh. these magical rituals were encoded by moses as the "law".

later, these "laws" were explained by elijah to just be a way for you to believe, but are completely unnecessary if you could just believe. you, a human being with desire was enough to make an influence on your reality, and the "office" of the prophet was born with elijah by explaining that ritual was not necessary to allow desire to become manifest.

jesus later "fulfills" this law (ritual), by showing people that their belief alone is powerful enough to allow desire to become reality. I don't want to dig too far in here, and I'll write this out in full soon enough as I have come up with, what will probably be, a very controversial desription of the what I think this whole thing has been leading up to...

anyway, back to friday night reading: I really wish that the subject that riann would have chosen wasn't such an interesting one for me because then I would have been able to pay a whole lot more attention to the multitude of different things that I was feeling.

---

I really don't know how much more of this I can endure. for me, feelings are more real to me than reality. I really wish I could have been calm and feeling good, to be able to look at each of the girls passing by and to really feel them and to get a good sense of what is happening. I don't really know what to think anymore; I honestly don't. I want to go to feel all of this out a bit better with the stars to be more ... brb, gonna go check the cloud situation.

pretty cloudy. so, for now I will just write the ones that I can remember feeling, and then hopefully I can think on it more later. the girl that walked past as I was about to walk outside was notable to me, but I wasn't trying to do anything more than escape the situation, so I didn't know what to think there. there was another girl that was with a guy I think her name was courtney or something like that. I really didn't know what to think about there either. next, there was a girl in blue that walked by a few times while I was desperately trying to focus on the sekmet thing, and I wasn't sure at all either there. lastly, there was a girl in white that seemed to transmit a very strong feeling, but I couldk't be sure if it was actuaally her or not.

there were others too that I can remember, but their feelings felt to me, even if some of them transmitted strongly, to be chaotic or something. the I only noted the ones above where I felt something that was recognisable from the total chaos of feelings today -- and I'm not even sure at all of what I felt!

I'm really off of my game today. I have not yet, at all, adjusted to the new enewgy level I achieved last night, and I really don't at all know what on earth is happening (well kinda). I really believe that nosebook is really desperately trying their hardest to try and slow down my vision levels (howeer they can't), and the massive amount of chaos I am experiencing will decrease as I adjust to the higher level of chaos as my new "normal" setting, yet with my capability now to simply get vision levels almost without even any effort, only tells me that this trend will likely worsen as I approach 6d perception. I also don't know if the chaos is coming only from their systems trying to shut down my receptivity to the feelings of others[^1], or if the chaos is also coming from an expanded sensitivity, and I'm kind of living in a sea of the emotions of everyone around me in (?)km radius.

I think it's a bit of both, but logically, it seems like what is happening is I'm just feeling a whole lot more from a whole lot more people.. I actually think that a lot of women (and perhaps even sensitive guys too, like I was talking to thad about it today even) actually experience this in a lesser intensity all the time. it has to be a lesser intensity than what I'm experiencing now, because otherwise it would be debilitating (I'm reminded of heather's description here).

I'm gaining more sensitivity, so other people's emotions which I'm still resonant with are becoming stronger all the time. however, at the same time, I'm quickly rearranging my form of perception so that those emotions that I'm feeling from others don't really bother me anymore (so I no longer resonate with that emotion). that process of rearranging my perception is actually the reason why I'm gaining so many visual levels so fast because less dissonant vibration is present, allowing more energy to flow, which allows me to feel even more, forcing me again to rearrange my perception so they no longer produce resistance, allowing me to get more vision upgrades, which increases my sensitivity forcing me to rearrange my perception so that those emotions no longer cause resistance, ad infinitum...

so, it appears that they're blocking the normal visceral feeling of desire that I feel from girls, yet that's actually making the whole thing easier for me to gain visual levels even faster. if I were able to feel their desire, I would focus on their desire and the choas would be drowned out by that, so by forcing me to feel the chaos by removing the desire, I'm incentivised to rearrange my perception to reduce the impact of that chaos -- instead of ignoring the debilitating chaos by focusing on their desire which feels good.

they're "forced" to do me a huge favour here :) let's just hang on as things get more intense. I *think* that all of the girls I mentioned were notable to me for a reason. I just want to make sure though when I'm more stable.

[1]: it most certainly is, because things have never felt more doad, cept sometimes when something slips through, I feel it strongly for only about a second before it vanishes

[2]: yeah, I know I sound like I'm totally paranoid at this point, lol -- yet not without good reason... last night I spent the majority outside unconscoius. maybe I'm paranoid, but I assure you I didn't go out to the field to sleep in the cold... I have good reason to think they're getting desperate... it's just my opinion, I know.. believe whatever you want about it. I don't know for sure either way myself, but I'm going with the most likely explantation. I doubt any clarity will come as a result. I just keep going forward, and it doesn't seem to be that big of a problem. forgive my paranoia :)

### 2020-02-29 10:20 - paranoia revisited

last night I was critical of graham hancock about his orion connection to the pyramids, saying that I think it discredits his position of a megalithic global society which predates the dynastic egyptians. this global civilisation had technology capable of constructing megalithic structures to a precision not even achievable today. in my opinion, there is undeniable evidence of the existence of this civilsation, and the mainstream narrative of the pre-dynastic egyptians, just out of the stone age, building things like the great pyramid, to me is complete rubbish. there is no way that could possibly be. graham has been one of the greatest promotors of this pre-dynastic global civilsation with advanced technology, and I really think that's great.

I haven't read the orion book, so I don't really know what I'm talking about here, but I think the orion thing is a loose theory at best. I don't think there's good enough evidence to support it, and there are further difficulties, because in one of brien's videos he states that across egypt, the east/west orientation of structures has shifted 23° -- which seems to be evidence of that the east/west orientation of the planet was different at some time in the past. velikovski's work suggests something similar as well.

however, I believe, and for some reason google isn't cooperating at the moment, that the gizah pyramids along with the sphinx *are* aligned to the cardinal directions. so the planet was out of alignment for some period of great turbulance when the structures brien refrred to were built? then the planet returned to alignment again? it's really difficult to know for sure. seems there have been a number of changes to the earth's rotation and alignment in the distant and maybe even not so distant past. or, maybe the pyramid was built such that the planet would eventually stabilise into, and conform to the cardinal alignment of the pyramids?

we don't really know.

---

anyway, the reason why I'm writing this is because my critical comment last night was because I'm becoming more and more sensiive to how I communicate. I fall into the very same trap of discrediting my solid evidence information with some wild speculation, all the time.

take last night for example. included in and in the midst of a lot of information that I would consider to have solid evidence for, I speculated that the plumbers were in the middle of some plet to try and manipulate my conditions to try and limit my energy again[^1]. I'm super paranoid about all kinds of bizarre stuff, because the majority of it has, in my opinion, quite solid evidence for it. I'm pretty sure I'm the centrepoint of the greatest conspiracy humankind has ever seen. call me crazy, I know...

anyway, I just wanted to apologise to graham, and point out that my critisim is directed almost entirely at myself. I'm super sensitive now and have begun to really want to improve the way I communicate and present my ideas. this is a bit of a departure from how I normally am, often stating that people's inability to understand me is not my problem. I don't feel obligated to try and make my ideas accessible, and I didn't get to where I am today by listening or believing other people, either. in fact, nearly everyone I have talked to has tried to force me into their dumb narrative that the network doesn't exist and isn't a real thing -- probably just like the pre-dynastic civilisation didn't exist. sorry man; I get it.

[1]: it turns out that I may have just misinterpreted the things. it's more likely that the plumbers are trying to squeeze a little more work out of my easy to convince mom, and the intentional proclamation to push an idea through sound in his voice was more likely just a way to get away with more hours... I don't know. whatever.

### 2020-02-06 11:59 - thoughts on drugs and celibacy

one of the things that caught a few of our attention on wednsday was when aaron said that prolonged practice of celibacy can cause the body to deteriorate. personally, when I was younger I would go back and fourth on the idea of marriage, but utimately decided that I wanted to be celibate. there were a number of reasons for my decisions, but that's not the point of this entry. I can easily see that when you are burning with desire for affection from someone, yet at the same time putting your own resistance to your own desire (I'm reminded of the two trains analogy that abraham uses to describe this: your desire going one way, and your belief going the opposite), that kind of internal tension will *definitely* manifest as a physical ailement of some sort.

however, my desire to not engage in sexual relations is not one of resistance. I'm interested in someting else; I just don't think that women have what I'm looking for. you see, I have, through the years, turned inwardly and begun the process of self-discovery. I have a pretty good idea of what's inside of me, and I want that much more than anything else. I have seen people around me in all sorts of relationships, such that the relationship is actually thier biggerst hindrance to finding what they're looking for inwardly. in my opinion, what I have inside of me is what I want! girls or whatever can come later, but that's what I'm looking for, and I'm 100% certain that I can find it on drugs... that is actually how I figured out that it was there and attainable in the first place.

once I figure that bit out, I *know* that beyond whatever that is, there is a whole lot more even than that. I am certain that area is largely undiscovered and is pretty infinite in size. as a result, I really want to do drugs again and begin to discover that area. aaron said another thing on wednesday too, saying that he thinks that psychedelics are also an artificial boost. I agree, as with all forms of pleasure, including sex. those moments of high stimulus are important for feeling good enough to make a new decision.

LOA prevents you from (very easily) thinking in a much different way than the way you feel, so it's a really good idea to go and do something that will make you feel better, so that in that better feeling state you can rethink some things in a lighter feeling. all pleasure is fleeting and quite temporary[^1], so it goes away when the stimulus goes away. so, the only real lasting thing is the decisions you make and the way you cange the way you decide to feel about certain things. those changes are lasting and continual work on that will get you feeling lighter and lighter until you do not need the pleasure anymore to change your mind.

---

anyway, at the wednesday meeting, I drew the 7 of wands, and the card clearly had the message for me, "why are you fighting so hard?" that much was obvious to me. anyway, upon further reflection I was looking at the thing from the celibate angle and it helped me to see clearly. if what I want is inside of me, then upon encountering that, the girls or whatever can come later... so, why not then just go after it?

I like to smoke and do drugs because they alter my state of consciousness and allow me to see things a different way. the problem when I don't smoke and do drugs (I'm including coffee and sex[^2] in the drugs category), is I start going really fast. the alteration of my perception always slows me down. this is a good thing because it allows me some time to recalibrate my direction and not get going too fast with some faulty logic.

I do enjoy these different forms of lowering my speed, because actually with the correction to my mental processess, I actually go faster in the long run. I'm secure that I will be able to go exremely fast and correct my direction in pretty real-time without much effort. I'll just need some alone/star time to make sure everything is in order. I should be able to get all the way to fully connected from where I'm at now, and it's the goal, now at this point.

I've come a long way now and I can get easily the answers I'm looking for with almost no effort. in fact, I don't even really *need* the alteration of consciousness anymore to change my direction, because I'm already so receptive to stuff. so, I guess it's time to start going full speed. I don't think navigating is going to be a problem.

I also made another change too, because I had some conflict. previously I wanted so badly to continue to expand my consciousness, that I was basically like matthew with his cigarettes. the first opportunity that I have to do drugs, I will be doing them. however, after thingking about it a little bit. I can imagine that some, but probably not all of the girls may want to take a psychedelic journey too. so, it will instead be my goal to see if a group of us who want to do some mental expansion and exploration later on. I think that would be more fun, anyway. clearly, this sort of thing isn't for everyone, so why not just wait until there is a group of us that want to do it?

[1]: psychedelics are unique because in most cases (the exception being MDMA), they don't really make you feel differently than you alraedy feel. they simply amplify the feeling that you already have. this is why "set and setting" is so important, because you go in with a bad mindset or in a environment that's aggitating to you, and you *will* have a bad trip. psychedelics are also unique because they open up your receptivity greatly and you can get a lot of really great insights, so when the effect goes away, *hopefully* you're left with some new ideas about how you can perceive the things that previously bothered you.

[2]: I include sex in this idea of slowing me down because it appears what is really happening with this whole girls thing is it's that it's the ultimate in trading speed for more power. it'll be a huge ding to my speed, but the longer-term power-boost will be a whole lot more. I mean power in the sense of thrust or torque, not political power, lol.


### 2020-03-07 22:12 - some comments on some things...

I listened to an abraham thing for the first time in quite a while today. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I used to. in fact, some parts about it really weren't that enjoyable to me at all. they have this new word they're using, "calibrate" -- which is the same thing as tuning, but sounds a bit more mechanical. I usually think of calibrate in the sense of a measurement or to get a baseline for an exporiment or something like that. it doesn't make much sense to my mind when they say that word. I layed there listening to them and they are *still* going over the same old issues over and over.

the one I listened to was titled, "are you calibrating or manipulating?" (from 2020-02-01 san francisco) and they keep needing to emphasise to people that they should be calibrating to their source, and not to the poople around them (as if to garner their approval). I feel very tired of the subject myself. I'm tired of telling people the same thing. I know they won't go so far as to say, follow your own guidance, not what the autorities say, because following the authorities guidance for you is the path of least resistance for most.

listenng to the guy, I was totally feeling a lot of depression of maentally returning to the world where I have to think and be concerned about what other's think about me. the next guy up had a similar thing about caring what his boss thinks about him when he gets on him for silly tiny mistakes...

I really *RAELLY* appreciate the world I live in now where, "I don't give a rip about what others think". I'm so glad that abraham has infinite patience with you guys going over the same old things viewed from hundreds of different angles now. I just don't have that kind of patience I was noticing, and I only survived an hour into it.

listening to that really illuminated for me how well I see things now, that I really like my own world. I feel on a lot of the things they talk about, I also began to have this new type of reaction that I had not felt before where I could feel people's sense that I have more simple or perhaps more direct explanations and a more "scientific" or "data-oriented" type answers than they do. they keep things pretty general for sake of accuracy, they are very careful to pick their words and stuff. I however, am not afraid to make mistakes and just jump right in with my best guess. a lot of my past answers are clearly seen now to have been a partial or incomplete perspective of the concept.

because I can make mistakes like that, or jump right into a super taboo subject without having to talk my way around it, I begun to see how it's kinda cool how we have this kind of two different perspectives. it seems that we are saying a lot of the same things, just in very different ways. I'm much more "raw" and kinda like in-the-process real-time improvement on the concept as I learn it.

dispite my difficulty with the subject matter they're on, like still caring about what people think, I did also feel and had the sense that a lot of people are kind of like learning right along with me. I don't really know why I felt that, because in my opinion, the evidence seems to be completely to the contrary to that. it feels like just about every adult in my life is really hanging on to old ideas. it sounds like there are people making progress too though... I dunno I had this sense that abraham seems to be really doing a great job for the people still hanging on to older ideas...

so, does that make me the "minister of the new ideas"? obviously, no, but it did make me think that parhaps I have more of an effect than I thought I did. it made me think about it a bit more, because honestly I'm completely winging it on everything I say at the moment. I'm completely learning this stuff as I go, but it seems like I have some sort of extra-something of this knowledge. it all makes perfect sense to me, and I'm just trying to find better and better ways to get the things explained. I'm not channeling anything. everytime I talk about it, I'm just brain-dumping my latest understanding of how I have conmeptualised it all working.

---

dramatic change of subject. after writing down the frist draft of the venus & mercury story (theory) I started reading the emerald tablets translated by that guy. I think it's all fluff and no real substance. I think the author is making it all up. I'm half-way though it, and none of what I read is a vibrationally good way to perceive things (punishment, following laws, etc.) and it doesn't actually say anything at all of substance.

it turns out that there are multiple legends to thoth being the creator of the great pyramid (and that he was also the biblical enoch). I didn't know this. when I wrote a while back that I think the great pyramid was not craeted by more than one or a few people, I was referring to thoth. I found it quite obvious that these different structures built like carnac in france, the dolmans, stonehenge, etc. where all energetic things, and they seem to each be different improvements and variations on the idea of how to amplify and harnesss the earth's energy to create more and more mindblowing experiences.

obviously the creator could fly, levitate stones with thier mind, shape them, etc. if I could imagine someone like tesla going around the earth to try and find the best location for his next energy amplifier, I would imagine this sort of thing, where all sorts of these appear one after another, as he moves from one project to the next. I imagined this as the journey one guy (thoth) did to reach ever higher and higher states of consciousness meanwhile people on the earth were basically living in the stone age. no one messed with him though because he could fly and move large stones without touching them, so it would be silly to try and fight him. he was considered a "god"

I fiund it very likely that "egypt" was actually formed around the pyramid(s?) because of the beneficial conditions that existed around it. thoth taught them the science behind vibration and frequency and they leveraged that to make more pyramids. however, I think thoth kind of set the planet up for controlled cataclysm[^1]. this was the difference between the old kingdom and dynastic egyptians.

---

anyway, after I wrote that story, I got all sorts of mixed reactions to it, mostly from nosebook. they probably didn't put it out to you guys. anyway, the most interesting one, was that we're approaching our next "cataclysm" here soon. it's not really a cataclysm, unless you want to remain in the lower levels of consciousness. the sense that I get is that basically energy is increasing at a rapid rate, and it looks like the two options are, learn to function at the energy levels that I'm at now (or perhaps higher), or perish. since they don't want to die, they have the option putting their consciousness back into a past timeline and doing it again.

obviously, they since they can take anything digital with them, they can essentially orchestrate it it such that the timeline they're going to has hardware and software just waiting for them to put into production when they get there. they can also program their own selves to simply follow a pre-defined program which gets everything all set-up and their consciousness downloaded and capable of accessing all of the things they've learned from the previous timeline.

it seems quite likely to me that they could probably optimise this such that each timeline they jump to, they could compress the aquisiion of hundreds of years of technological advances into a year or two, meaning that by 2016 in their latest timeline, they could be utilising incredibly powerful tech. they may not even need to re-experience the whole thing each time either, because the transmission of consciousnsss (the things they've learned from past timelines) and the sutup of the tecnology could be completely automated, such that the automation program prepares the timeline automating each of their bodies to do the required things for everything to be ready for when their consciousness takes over the body..

really it would be quite a painless process when they figure it out, and it could be quite something they could sell to people interested in getting their perfect life all setup for them.

the only catch is you would "only" (really, it's quite a long time when you think about it) get ~20 years before the energy levels reach a new hight and the galaxy forces them to make a new timeline (probably one that's even more optimised).

here's where it gets interesting: each time they all peace-out to a new timeline, it'll leave a whole bunch of people on the planet which will go through a "magnetic excursion" event, where the the solar system (and therefore planet earth) passes between the "double layers" of the galactic wind (ehhh, like solar wind, but from the galaxy: what interacts with the heliopause), and everything will go into a low magnetic field. the "adam and eve story" (1993 edition) predicts potentially catastrophic changes in sea level, and gives quite the prepper pep-talk. I don't believe it'll happen unless perhaps you attract it(?).

what I think is more likely to happen is earth's atomsphere will collapse for a while and things may get VERY HOT (tons of cosmic and UV rays though), so it's not so bad because if you're shielded from the sun, there's no problem. lots of plants and animals will die, but new species will spring into being...

I got way off-track (hehe) here... what I was saying is that I don't believe it'll be that catastrophic at all. I think the only change that will occur will be one of light intensity or something to do with the light, if even that. I do not believe that there is anything catastrophic going to happen. I think the catastrophic stuff is a certain future for the worriers. they will definitely experience that future. however, if you're not concered about the changes then you wouldn't need to go back in time and redo the timeline again.

there may even be a natural LOA based solution already planned for this. if you are vibrationally considerably different from the you in 2012, and there's no way for the program to get the new-timeline version of you prepared for your consciousness, then it's likely there will be no solution and you cannot go back anymore and must go forward with the new earth. that may not be a bad thing... here's why.

if you think about it from the perspective of the guys going back over and over to repeat the timeline from a position of extreme technical and mental superiority, it'll become boring, if there's no challenge. obviously, from our end it kind of has a different challenge. each time, we have to find a way to consciously, come into alignment with who we are. obviously none of these future timelines I will be the star because they have to make sure I don't get connected. so, that opens up the opportunity for the guy or gal that finally gets conneceted, to kind of take the new earth through a non-cataclysmic evolution. nosebook (and friends) peaces out to the next timeline, assured that the new guy will never make it to getting connected, etc. ad infinitum.

in this way, you could almost perceive it less of a competition, and more of a role-playing game where the ones are taking the roles they want to take, and everyone has the option to switch sides if they choose. it pains me to say it, but if I don't get connected, it seems pretty obvious that I'm stuck on the nosebook plan. anyone could switch sides in just the same way.

[1]: one of the illuminati principals, is that controlled conflict creates conrolled change. well, same thing here too: controlled catastrophe creates controlled evolution. I think, like tesla with his world system, and the reference to the INFECTED ONES, thoth in the same way, also foresaw the effects[^2] that his pryamids would have on society and how our human nature interacting with his technology would set us up for a sequence of events that would happen naturally as a result of LOA (just like tesla mentioned about the "laws of nature", talking about his world system).

[2]: I mean he has the capability of creating all of these things in his mind (including alternate timelines), and experimenting with them too see their results. a mind that can perceive and create something as intricate as the great pyramid is beyond what we're capable of even comprehending he was capable of...


### 2020-03-08 10:47 - a few responses to some things

#### does it have to be continually a single guy getting connected, similar to me?

probably not. I imagine that they'll get the system pretty well buttoned down so that no one gets connected for the duration of the time they're there. I don't even think it's necessary that they have a single guy in the spotlight that gets everyone on the network, either. probably that entire bit can be skipped entirely and they would just have everyone tracked and manipulated without their knowledge that there is even a network at all. people will continue to believe it impossible that you could see through someone else's eyes. only the select few will have access to the network. I can imagine really powerful economic and world leaders that are given this capability while everyone else is treated like I am right now, with no access, and it's 100% a secret that the thing exists in the first place.

therefore, that means to me that, because there will be no way they can make a law prohibiting you from watching stars, that will be the only way. I don't know how, but perhpas they could find a way to reverse the whole weed thing and make sure other drugs are off limits. that basically leaves sex and stars as the only real methods to get connected, because meditation is likely waaaayyy too slow. it's just not powerful enough to overcome their system's counter-influence.

so that really opens up the opprtunity to nearly everyone. it *could* be just one guy, but I find that unlikely, as it'll probably be a whole bunch of people (us) dropping into those bodies from another timeline. I would anticipate that there will be only a few adults that figure it out, with children/teens being the majority ones that are the stars in this future. I believe they can easily stop one guy, but stopping a hundreds or thousands of people becomes a real difficulty (at first, but later when so much of it is automated, it's likely that it won't be so hard).

the other possibility, is so that they retain the authority that the network has on people, like it does now (as opposed to keeping it entirely a secret), would be to make a kenny-like person come to people's similar to how I did -- cept it woudl be a complete fabrication, just rehashing my story and passing it off as someone else's. they would get everyone on the network just like they did with me to watch this other guy, but instead of me, this other guy would be 100% controlled by them, and he wouldn't write things like this, and would tell everyone the lies they want to hear. this way, they could have the control they want, to be able to tell people to not watch stars, a monetisable platform (can't sell stuff if it's entirely a secret).

as for me, I simply wouldn't exist to anyone. they would likely let some event like the vallecas thing appear that I had died, and keep me in stasis or something to where I couldn't interact with people. I would be wiped from history in this timeline, and no one would ever know I existed, allowing the other guy to show up in a simlar manner as I did. the other option is probably a few iterations in the future, to take my conscoiusness out of my body and have the other guy who's under their control go into my body (at say an event like vallecas) and just pretend to be me.

wait, lemme summarise those: in the first iterations, it may be easier to retain control over the people by making a controlled version of me get everyone on to the network and exercising their control over people directly. however, that may be less effective and a whole lot of extra work in later iterations. it may be easier once so much about people's minds have been figured out, that they're practically robots, just following the directions given to them, that it may just be easier to have everyone fully automated and the network cept a secret.

in "the one" getting everyone on the network phase, a lot of sexual libration would take place (I'm assuming, that was the major selling point that got men and women so interested in the network) but, that would be the easy way for people to get connected. they could in hightened sexual experience begin to get connected. so, in the later phase of keeping everything a secret and steering people as if they were machines and some automated way of installing devices in them, too -- if everything was kept a secret, the sexual libration that has taken place since 2016 wouldn't happen either, so that leaves stars and drugs as the only possible ways (that I can think of), but if people are able to be steered so easily, then they could be directed away from the stars.

the last possible one that I could think of, is after the "the one" getting everyone on the network phase, instaed just set everything up and just give the network to everyone, boosting the DMT levels in their head until everyone is practically in a dream-state (similar to now) so they feel very little resistance to the things, and then just establsh control little by little (I'm sure they can find a way) until everything is under control. no secrets about it, just establish that everything is recorded, and that it's like the global justice system or something believable like that, and the global justice system decides and mitiates all crime around the globe. immediately follow it up with relaxing traffic laws and speed limits, saying that they will be fined only if they're really driving recklessly. then, optimise a bunch of things that are a total pain, like the commerce and finance systems, establishing a new amazon currency giving the whole globe access to amazon, make drones capable of doing the deliveries, and make sure drones can get into people's houses to deliver things (and install devices in them while they sleep).

that might be the most feasible one, actually, but it may take a few iterations to get there.

#### what's in it for the people involved?

when they make a timeline, we also put our consciousness into the timeline (for more energy/desire/power), and every time they need to make an iteration, they will transfer their consciousness out of the timeline and into the new one, leaving a pretty vacant earth, with those of us that put our consciousness into the timeline.

when they want to move everyone (all of their easily steered robots) over to the new timeline, only the people that were not capable of accecpting the frequency of an unprepared or prepared body in their new timeline will stay. each time this happens, those who are left-behind get to create as if it were a new earth, meaning that there are no other outside influences that can cause problems cept for their own form of perception (and the way that interacts with LOA). this means that anyone who decides they no longer want to be a robot, has to gain such a vibrational dissimilarity to the other timeline, that they do not accept a body.

by default, I imagine that they will be taking everyone else along with them. these will be categorised into two groups: the ones with a planned life in the new timeline and the ones who are being put there because they're easy to steer. there's nothing in it really for the people who are easy to steer, but since timelines can be created with planned desired events for some people who, at first will probably have to pay to have the luxurious life experience in the new timeline. however, as the automation of people's life events gets easier, it may behoove them to make it more accissible to everyone, so that people are not "dragged" along just because they're easy to be steered, but because they want to be steered to have the life experience of their desires.

#### what's the final outcome?

well, I think the way that it's all heading is that from each iteration there will be a bunch of creators who have figured out how to get into a nearly vacant earth with a bunch of people that they want to be with (I assume), and only LOA to show them the rough patches in their vibration, as this world will illustrate to them how well things really are. this can be seen as the descending worlds (from the peak down), and the one everyone is creating in the robot steering and planned realities, are the ascending worlds (from the peak upward).

this will create such enormous diversity, and I'm convinced that the next phase of human development will be to begin unifying these timelines, and it'll probably come from the main ascending (nosebook controlled super robot steering) timeline, because that's the one with the most contrast.

that's a ways in the future, and things are going to be a whole lot different then -- because nosebook will have figured out how to create their reality the way they want it and not fight against it so hard, and we'll have learned the same thing.. to create our own reality and not fight it so hard. the same thing really, but coming at it from oppsite directions.

### 2020-03-10 08:31 - more responses

#### are we stuck doing the same 20 years over and over?

I don't think so. it seems to me that the natural order of things will yield that energy increases, such that people are prepared for the higher energy levels on this planet when it happens (2038?).

I think there are a number of options here for what that could be like. if it's decided to finally go past the time limit, it's unlikely that the whole populus will figure out how to raise their vibration by theirselves, the people of the planet would need to be using some form of perception which is of a higher vibration, and then to ease them into it slowly over some years.

if they choose to go with the controlled replacement for me plan, the planet could use his (I sincerely doubt it will be a her) form of perception -- which would be essentially his interpretation of my form of perception. the other option would be to manufacture an artificial form of perception, which the AI's can understand and utilise theirselves too, basically giving the machines the ability to see. this is probably the most easily controlled, because it means that means that people are locked into a world only as big as the AI can comprehend.

once that's in place (it'll probably take a few iterations to do it all), then it's quite possible the planet will be ready to continue on -- consider that the getting ready process.

#### how is a timeline created?

well, the way I understand it is, that you need a backbone, to which everything else becomes relative to. what I mean by that is consider this idea. imagine my future sure had propared this timeline. he would start from some point (say back in 2012, even though it was most likely much earlier than that -- propbably 2000) and then make sure that certain events happen: such that I am guaranteed to push raquel to contact the US for help, she gets in the network, they put me in the network etc. this is all the preparation for the body (kenny) to be ready for the event where I gain a new consciousness (vallecas). in that event, my consciousness was merged with my future self.

the next thing that has to be done is to make my timeline completely linear and fully planned. obviously not everything can be planned, but you it needs to be such that you can predict future moments or events. you could see me as a sort of automaton where you put me in an environment, a predictable set of events would occur (eg. I have enough triggers installed such that there is very little variation in what the result of the encouter is). my future self is looking from the future backward, so he would just let the events transpire and check the result. if the result isn't what is desired, adjust the triggers so that a different result happens. rinse and repeat.

so, let's say for example this event right right now was one of the ones that was planned. there would be some sort of trigger to know when I'm gaining desire to write about how nosebook could create a timeline for the alternate earth, then he could "fast-forward" on the timeline until he hits that trigger, add more triggers go give me the right ideas of the right things to say (maybe not perfectly accurate, but accurate enough that you'll know what I'm talking about), and then rinse and repeat.

all of the stuff that happens between these planned events is entirely up to LOA to make happen.

it seems like these triggers only have a range of effect. meaning, that you can't really trigger yourself to do something you're not capable of doing, so you have to kind of design "lessons" to aid yourself in being capable of receiving and responding apprepriately to the trigger. this is is also important to realise when thinking about designing triggers for the populus as well. they will also need to have events take place to allow them to be receptive to certain triggers (so that they can be steered). this also has something to do with and is linked to the AI form of perception, too.

obviously this can be expanded out quite a bit so that relationships and encounters can be orchestrated (this is likely something worth selling). it makes something like a bunch of people (sheeps) which are herded and steered according to the desires of those on the top, and a bunch of wolves that are just picking off the ones they want.


### 2020-03-11 11:45 - the craziest idea I've had yet

I woke up this afternoon with the craziest idea I thought notable enough to write down. I began with the realisation that my replacement would be much more awesome than me in so many areas, but it doesn't matter to me because IMO there's nothing that can beat the fastest particle in the universe... I do have some restrictions though, which means I can never really get a perfect manifestation. there always needs to be something that's missing which formulates my desire for the next thing.

imagine that on their timeline they make drug usage impossible but it's something that I really want to do (because maybe on this timeline I find a lot of really valuable stuff with them). it may or may not happen that way, I can't be sure, but let's just say that it is. somhow that strong desire to have an external stimulus give me a new perspective, and so instaed of a drug I find a way of becomming something like a genetic engineer which designs a virus which "attacks" the body n a similar way that the psychedelcs do, causing an epidemic in the population wherby their sensitivity to LOA becomes super amplified and they're foreced to create a new perspective.

it actually would need to create two new perspectives. the new layer they're creating thrust is a non-physical gyp (scam) of the desire layer mixed with lots of faulty logic (structure). the story layer is similar, it's a basically the emotional/conceptual form of perception (5d), mixed with the detachment of the physical (3d) layer. so the two (4) new layers that are being created would be a gyp of the logic or structural layer and an new form of imagination, followed by a gyp of the conceptual/emoional layer and then a gyp of the relational layer.

the virus would "infect" everyone but surely they will somehow find a way to counter it, meaning they would need to integrate the new developments this virus brings about, while at the same time not getting infeced theirselves -- which is what I think will be the mechanism which will "force" them to create the 4 new layers[^2].

---

I went to sleep thinking about how big of a pain it is that they have to essentially use me o create their new timelines[^1] so that means that they are essentially using my conscionsness as the platform upon which their gypped version of reality runs off of.

when I woke up, I was also thinking about how if I get going too fast then, I would lose them, so I have to continue to give them the boost they need to keep creating these knock-off versions of reality. it's easy to see that these layers are not on top of the previous ones, but are actually perpendicular to the 7 layers I started with. they probably will take another 90° turn and make another perpendicular set of layers to that resulting ultimately in a cube or something where they meet again.

well, adding on the 4 new layers means there needs to be a new midpoint which is the new platform from which physical and non-physical come out of. it's clear that it's essentially me that's doing this. their versions of reality are appear to be designed such that source's and LOA's influence is mitigated as much as possible.

well, with me as essentially the "platform" upon which all of this is built, I could see how I would become the new midpoint layer or like the source version of these gyp layers[^3]. I was thinking about how I would want to do it, and I think I would want to make it so that LOA is essentially like a bazillion times more powerful, so that creation would be basically instant (much like a permanent dream-state would be).

---

I don't really know. this was a fun thought experiment that I was excited about when I woke up and thought it was worth writing down. I picked the virus idea as the next phase because it's a foreign substance that dramatically alters your body condition, similar to a drug, and permanently affects the genome of the person. it also has some funny and subtle irony with the INFECTED ONES narrative and the covid-19 freakout happening in the news.

it probably won't be like that at all, but I find it funny to try and think of new counters to their attempts to control. I liked this idea because in order for a "drug" to work in their new setup on completely controlling the mind, it couldn't be a drug anymore. it would have to actually be a invasive organism that attacks and mutates the biology of the organism such that it would probably leave a permanant effect on the biology, almost like you're on the drug all of the time. or something like that... I dunno, but I was thinking about how much fun it would be to design a virus that gives you psychedelic effects and expands your consciousness permanently.

[1]: I was contemplating if they would want to take (the alternate versions of) me along with them, for each of their iterations, but concluded that it's unlikely because I would gain in strength that way, and that would make me unpredictable, so likely to ensure that I remain predictable to do exacty as their preparation program needs to... well, now that I'm thinking about it, it may not be, their preparation program could also prepare me to accept their new super twisted and tortured version of me... I dunno... I can't really predict that sort of thing. I don't haeve enough info

[2]: and potentially also it seems, that if it's expanding consciousness out of the previously two new layers, that means that it would be creating kind of like anti-conscoiusness to counteracto those previous ones.. so yeah, actually I think it would somehow eventually create both the anti-gyp-layers and force them to create the remaining gyp layers. it would look like two corners of a cube if they're all perpendicular to each other.

[3]: the virus would create the anti-gyp layers. I don't really know what that meanss, but there's another missing midpoint, so would that mean their machine version of reality would become the final missing midpoint? I dunnno. I can't think about that far anyway, this is pretty difficult for me to imagine anyway.


### 2020-03-13 05:40 - I think more manipulation is happening

a few concepts in no particular order...

##### when I don't feel good, I teld to be very robotic

I have noticed this happens with other people, too. I've noiced it especially with military servicepeople and law enforcement types. life is sort of bland and generally doesn't feel too good, but they've kind of accustomed to the dreary nature of things and so tend to respond very reactively or robot-like. I find myself responding very similar to things when I don't really feel good. I'm not saying I'm one of the INFECTED ONES, but my nature seems to point in almost every way to the direction that I'm more similar to these types than you may think. the only notable differences I have noticed between us are the following[^1].

1. (joy) I am genuinely interested in finding ways to feel good, rather than masking or temporarily feeling better with pleasure. most make a career out of feeling bad, accepting it as normal, and instead of finding a way to feel good, instead numb theirselves or find a way to toughen up so that it no longer affects them, or to "stuff it" and ignore the problem until it grows into something physical, which they toughen up to and refuse to admit is a problem until they're about dead and then they refuse to die. IMO, it's a whole lot easier to just find a way to feel good, and by feel good, I mean happiness, interest, or fun -- *not* pleasure.

2. I am not scared of taking drugs or other mind altering things which may provoke someone to change their perspective about something. in fact, while most of these guys are deathly scared of anything that could possibly influence them change their ways, learn or to grow, I find myself actually addicted now to the feeling of freedom that the new prespective gives me. each time I feel lighter and lighter, until it feels as if I'm floating or like I would be able to fly.

3. I tend to focus more on improvement, rather than performance or growth.

4. I like things to be controlled and well behaved. however, I do not believe that this is something that I want for other people. I believe it limits their creativity and self-realisation. however, as a programmer, I really like my programs to behave exactly as I told them to behave, and to be completely under my control. I can't stand programs where I don't really know what's happening in the program[^2].

back to the robot-like behaviour: I don't really know how to explain the robot-like thing, so I will just explain how I experience it. when I'm unable to feel good about the present situation or the decision I'm being forced to make (otherwise I would give it some time to think it through), I always resort to logic, and the logic is always very crude. it's the sort of logic that thinks like, if someone hurts you hurt them back.

you have often heard me say that I don't want to do the girls thing because, well  girls and sex are essentially the most common thing happening on this planet. in fact, none of us would be here without it, so big f-ing whoop. I'm going instead for something that no one has accomplished here on this planet right now, I want to fly, I want to create objects in my mind, wield the creative power of source energy effortlessly, and do all sorts of things that people would consider "magic". that's what I want... in that base logic mind, girls and sex is pretty much the lowest most redimentary form of interaction. I want the good stuff -- the real creative power, not the stuff that *EVERYONE* has access to.

each of those three items I listed are deeply cut into my most basic logical instruction set. they're like my reptilian instincts if you want to call it that. I suppose they weren't always that way, but that's what is so great about all of this experience. I've never been more clear about what's important to me.

##### are they trying to hose the dudes?

it feels like there is another attempt to try to get me with girls before I'm connected, again...

I can understand why nosebook would by interested in trying to do that at the beginning -- because they thought they could control me and use the girls to keep me from getting connected, but I think it was universally decided that my connection was essentially something entirely unavoidable.

then, it felt to me like there was another startling revelation that if I got connected with the girls, the dudes would miss out, and it would give the women (or receptive people) a sort of superiority as they would be the ones going following along with me and the girls.

it seemed like finally the conclusion was made that if everyone want participate, then nosebook would have to let everyone go up. in fact, I referenced this in an entry... [TODO: find referece]

clearly, if they're making another attempt to try and get me the girls, they're not planning on staying on this timeline...

first of all, that means that they're going to try and force a receptive superiority here on the planet (they're presumably leaving), excluding most men (taking them with them, or leave them here to "suffer")? I don't understand the reasoning here, and I may have some things off, but something is a bit weird...

so, the best I could come up with is that they want to get training on their machines to recognise the signals of someone getting connected form sex (presumably so they could block it). but, I thought they discovered that I would get connected from the reality imposed dream-state, in the frist place -- so they already have those signals -- in fact, infinitely many more than would happen here, which would be just once.

the next idea I thought of is that maybe they wanted to maybe something to try out and ensure that raquel doesn't get connected when she's in my body, but that surely isn't it, because most certainly one of the timeline trigger invariant (they're like unit-tests) would be to fail if raquel gets connected in my body. so, it's certainly not that, either.

either way, I am certainly sure that I should wait until I get connected (which should, in theory, happen around the same time as everyone else gets connected)

[1]: actually, right after writing them down just now, I realised these correspond pretty well with the "triad of intentions": 1 corresponds with joy, 2 with freedom, and the last with growth

[2]: this last one doesn't fit into the triad of intentions, but I find i interesting that I don't really like neural nets in the way they're implemented. I can't understand what's really going on or why they're doing the thing they're doing. they're a complete black box for me.


### 2020-03-17 08:17 - I believe we can live in our own world...

... with a bridge between the two (meaning that we can both access eachother)
... that could never hold our weight (meaning we can't meet on the bridge)

---

after thinking a bit about wha I wrote last time, the conclusion is obvious: I am to continue on with the objective of getting connected. I know that seems obvious, but it gives nosebook full control over what happens. if they want to make it so that dudes are hosed here then they can just not let everyone go up, making things much easier for the girls and those willing to participate in their experience, to also get connected. it's also quite likely that we'll have a shared form of perception here on this planet. if that's not for you, then don't worry, it seems quite likely that nosebook will likely put you somewhere.. or, I dunno.

so I was thinking about this, and I would assume that anyone who wants to leave this timeline would clearly be given a choice to do so. no question about that, but I find it unlikely that they will ever let anyone know on their timeline that we exist. probably we'll be their big secret that no one talks about. they'll be able to see our planet and stuff (and assuming they find a way of increasing their own energy levels or some other way to handle the energetic difference between us), they'll have access to the future technological advancements that we make, as well. seems likely those will be kept a secret too, but who knows.

they will likely want to make sure that no one gets connected on their planet, and luckely for them, we exist, so that if someone gets connected, they could transfer their consciousness over to our planet and "get rid of them".

it also seems that things are shaping up in such a way that this planet will be one of receptive superiority, and theirs of assertive superiority. seems that they want to get things going in such a way that they have full control over people and are able to manipulate them in the way that they choose, putting different thoughts into their heads and stuff to get people to do what they want them to do. I don't believe this will be only nosebook, as it is right now, but will expand into possibly a much greater portion of the population, like say 10% or more.

going back to the one abraham I heard, "if you're not calibrating, you're manipulating" -- our planet will be all about finding any way you can to become receptive of who you really are. I use the word receptive instead of calibrating, because I want to use a word that has to do more with tuning. it's a practiced process to get so good at receiving that, and that practice is finding a way to feel the way you need to feel to be receptive of that (good). if you can't find a way to feel good, you can't be receptive of that. that is the practice.

---

so, I can think of how this could be a really good thing that may be starting to take place. so, I'm here and I get good at feeling the way I want to and being receptive of who I really am, no matter the circumstances -- but circumstances aren't too difficult here. I decide to try my hand at it in a much more difficult environment, so I transfer my consciousness[^1] over to their world. they see a bright new baby being born that has a considerable amount of consciousness[^2], and they know this kid will grow up to be a problematic person for them because of the massive amount of consciousness that arrived upon their birth. they need to monitor and make sure this kid doesn't get connected, so they need to manipulate him/her to make sure that doesn't happen.

as time goes on, the kid will grow up and will hopefully (or maybe it'll be planned, who knows) grow into someone that gets connected, and they find theirself back on this planet in perhaps the same body or another body of their choice.

sounds like a fun game to play.

[1]: I believe there is a way to tranfer consciousness without "killing" the body, so I find it quite likely that we'll use that technique to transfer consciousness between worlds, where as, I'm sure they'll want to make sure that consciousness isn't able to come back and cause more problems for them by disrupting their big show with someone who gets connected, so they'll probably choose to make sure the body does not continue to live.

[2]: I was thinking about what johnathan said about lots of DMT being present in the brain on birth and death, and this seems clear to me that these are present as evidence of low resistance, or high amounts of consciousness, so that when the child is born, the child will have enormouns amounts of DMT present in their brain, allowing them to receive a consciousness of equal magnitude. I believe I had enormous amounts of DMT in my brain when I had the haemorrhage and also in vallecas, and I probbly got new consciousness in those times.


### 2020-03-18 15:23 - I'm sticking to star-starwatching

I heard the neighbour outside playing basketball, and I really wanted to go out and see her, but I felt blocked. the last time I heard her, I woke up from sleeping and wanted to go out and see her -- so it's not really a question of desire. I do really want to get to know her and stuff.

however, like I said, I felt blocked. I laid outside thinking (and feeling) about what it was that was blocking me. the obvious thing that could be seen as different from this time and the last time is coffee. also, there was a time when I went to friendly harbor on saturday and heather's daugher holly was there, and I felt absolutely no blockage at all, wanting to talk to her. I just said -- I can't remember now -- but, it was effortless. I also had coffee and I felt artificically a lot better.

I brougt her up because I think that was the key to understanding this. heather had been complaining about not having anyone to babysit her kids and it didn't even occur to me that she may had been thinking about me (or maybe she wasn't), but the reaction came up for me to babysit. I have no alternate intentions at all. I've already pre-paved the whole thing such that I wouldn't be engaging in anything with her or anything. my priority is to get connected first.

so, LOA works its way out the way it does, because I pre-paved to not do anything and then I mentioned that I had no alternate intentions -- other than to buy weed with the money. I guess this was a dealbreaker, so my prepaving worked out pefectly. apparently, even though I had pre-paved it to be that way, perhaps (almost assuredly) some more manipulative forces were at work, that wanted to manipulate things so that something did happen. remember, "if you're not calibrating, you're manipulating." -- so LOA made it so that the whole thing would fall through, cause apparently I'm not as strong as I might think (remember, I'm terrified of little girls[^1], because they're so influential and cause my life to go into ultra-fast mode)

I then decided I wanted to quit substances and coffee. I thought that was kinda weird that I would be so strict on the coffee thing, but I really felt like it was something I wanted to do. it turns out now after this situation that I realise that the cuffee artificially makes me feel better than I feel, making it possible for me to have situations I don't want to happen, happen.

I'm just going to stick to watching stars. I really want to get connected, and it appear that my own intention to get connected is keeping me from substances and girls for now while I continue to get higher and higher.

it seems my own intention is the blockage, and that while I'm trying to calibrate, they're trying to manipulate. sorry but for me it's, "get connected -- and then..."

---

I really want to apologise though, because it may seem like I don't want to interact with the girls, or I'm avoiding them or something -- I'm not. I really want to, you have no idea. I'm so sick of this predicament I'm in, you have no idea. girls aren't the way out of it though, getting connected is, and I have to follow my intuition. hopefully, it's soon.

the thing is, I don't really think it is, though. I still feel like I still have a long way to go. some part of me says that it may be even a few years off still, but other evidence suggests to me that it's closer than that. my goal right now is by the end of this year. I'm making *HUGE* improvements on my star-watching and I'm releasing resistace at an alarming rate right now, such that I'm really hoping that it's soon even though it feels like it's still years away.

however it works out, I've found that I can't really think about it in that way. in fact, a huge lesson can be learned about the process I go through when I star-watch. if I have that attitude, the stars don't cooperate. if I'm thinking about all the latest reactions and stuff that are important to me (like what I'm writing here), the stars don't cooperate.

the only thing that works is to stop all of that "stuff" and get into the present moment, clear my mind of that crap, and focus on what I'm doing now. worrying or concerning myself with all that other stuff makes it impossible for me to focus on the star. it's hard though. I was thinking about johnathan and our conversation around meditation, and it's really really hard to let those thoughts go, because they feel important, and if I just let them go, they won't get solved -- and by thinking about them, it feels like I'm working on them. however, to feel good, and to feel that extreme at-oneness, I have to let those thoughts go and not worry about them.

turns out, I was telling him that he didn't need a meditation retreat to justify letting those thoughts go for the duration of the retreat, and he could begin to do that now -- but I was really telling myself that :) it's funny how that works. just have to get into the moment and focus on what's at hand, not all the other stuff[^2].

[1]: well, women in general really. I find that it brings about a sense of anxiousness in me. I like being in control of my own reality, and having other people there makes that more difficult. drugs are similar to women (sex) in that they are an accelerator, but I control it -- which is why I prefer drugs more. to compound the difficuly of feeling like I'm out of control, nosebook is behind all of the things, trying to manipulate everything. the thought of being with others right now in my present state, is absolutely *not* something I want to be doing. I prefer to wait till I'm connected, stable, and in control of things.

[2]: actually, after giving this some more thought, I realise that this is in fact what I'm looking for. this is the connection that I'm really aiming for. when I get into this state, everything sort of fades and I feel like neo on the matrix after his realisation when he's fighting one handed and everything is effortless. combine that with a focus where the whole world seems to fade away, and I don't even notice the other stuff happening, because it's not necessary to be present in the moment. it's really hard to explain. I wish that neo scene were slightly different, and it have you somehow the sense that the effortlessness came from focus, or rather lack of focus on the outside environment -- like the whole world blurred and started to become automatic and he just sits back and watches it. I know I can achieve this in daily life -- not just with the stars[^3].

[3]: it's all about letting those concerning thoughts go, and to stop worrying about all of this stuff that's out of my control. for example, the stress around this whole situation I'm describing is clearly the product of a whole lot of "trying to make things happen". I simply don't have to worry about them. LOA has them all worked out and I should just keep focusing on my own connection. it may seem like a frustrating thing to see from the outside, because it'll appear like I'm more and more happy and pleasant to be around, even though likely I'll appear more and more like I don't care at the same time. I do care though -- a lot, once I'm connected :)


### 2020-03-19 06:49 - a better way to look at it

let me just reframe last entry in the following way: we know that with certain conditions like sex or drugs, I can get connected. this is obvious because otherwise nosebook wouldn't have such a strong restriction on me for drugs. most likely, they have have a narrative they need to keep for you guys, and if I get connected from drugs, then that will make their narrative incorrect. for whatever reason they're pushing for some condition (which they control) to be the reason for my connection. rememeber, they *could* just let me go up when they want, but they don't want that. it feels like they need a justification for my connection which they can also attain (women), not stars (off limits), rethinking thoughts (they'll never change), or learning to leave all the daily concerns up to LOA to work out (can't happen; they need to be in control).

I want now more than ever to figure out how to get connected now without any conditions. that means without drugs such as coffee and other stimulants such as sex. I feel like I came to this point now and things are getting so easy, why not just go for the most difficult one yet. we all know I can do it with the right conditions, but can I do it without them? I'm sure I can. we'll ave to find out though, because I'm going for the energetic manifestation, not the physical conditions.

---

in a note in the last entry I mentioned that I girls (and sex) make me feel very out of control. well, I have established that the only real control that *anyone* has is the ability to feel the way they want to about the situation they're in. obviously, I don't feel the way I want to. I want to feel like I'm in control.

I don't know how to conjure that feeling because I've not yet discovered it yet (yes, there are still tons of otherworldly or "impossible" feelings still to be discovered and practised). so that means I have to find it. I also eluded to it in the previous entry talking about the meditation retreat: instead of waiting until I'm away (retreated) from life to finally allow the daily concerns to just exist and be there but not a concern (because LOA has it all worked out), is, I'm fairly sure, the way to achieving that feeling: finding a way in the middle of the details of life, to find a way to let all of those things just get worked out automatically, as I enter into that state which I described to johnathan as being able to hear the teacher (or whatever), but I was off somewhere else whereever my focus is.

I was just out this morning watching stars and I could get pretty easily to the letting everything else fade cept what I'm focused on (the star), pretty easily, but then a loud bird or truck or something would make a very loud sound and I would get startled. I'm not there yet. those things won't startle me anymore. in fact it will be like I don't even hear them.

also, I'm wanting to achieve that for daily life, and not just with the stars, so that I'm able to focus on what I want -- like my programming or whatever.


### 2020-03-20 06:53 - the political clones

yesterday when I woke up I had a kind of aha momement. the day previous, I was talking with mom and I told her that I had a theory which the politicians and lots of people in power are actually just AI controlled humans, designed to be as bad as possible. I figured they had to be operated by some alien race or something else that was interested in our evolution. the reason being, if you consider that perhaps humans may have bad ideas, but because of the LOA works, you cannot ever get rid of anything. so, in order to evolve us to something greater than the worst, you need something worser. I always thought of them as a kind of launch pad for us wanting to really go fast -- because, there's no way they can go that fast and continue to have those kinds of bad ideas. anyway, that idea became a bit more refined yesterday when I woke up.

I was thinking about the future version of earth where we would have contact with this planet and would be able to put consciousnesses through the -- let me just name them here for clarity: E is earth, and E' is the timeline that they're going to create where I never get connected, and they can setup their super-system where everything is under their control.

I'm pretty sure that sometime soon we're going to have the ability to transfer conscousness into he body of another timeline, cept it won't kill the body. I was thinking about this, and it would sort of be like neo on the matrix where he learned kung-fu "I know kung-fu!" -- it would seem like a second (or perhaps closer to instant) to us here on this planet, but to the person taking the journey it would feel like they lived out the life from birth to death on the other timeline. similar to a dream, a powerful vision, or a strong psychedelic experience, time would be compressed in such a way that it would feel instant. the mechanism would be quite simple actually.

when you are born and when you die, there is a tremendous amount of DMT in your system which means that those are the moments when you are least resistant and are "channeling" (or in tune with) the source version of you (the one without resistance, only focused on improvement "pure positive energy") and in those moments of extremely low resistance (birth and death), you'll be able to move consciousness in and out of the body with relative ease. so, you just setup that at the death of the body in the other timeline, you're conscoiusness is adjusted back to the body in the present timeline. obviously the "traveler" would have to be in an induced dream-like state already to begin with, so the traveler has full control of being able to get back into their body.

to the traveler, it would feel like they just had a very very intense and very long dream. however, the dream would have all sorts of benefits to it, because you could test your ability to get connected in a world where things are the designed to keep you away from that. certainly new and novel ways of figuring that out will continue to happen as both sides get better and better at it. there are infinite different situations that could take place and likely groups of people will go together to share a really great experience together in a difficult environment.

from the perspective of E', it's a bit different. they have to keep finding ways of controlling the things better, because each of us that comes through and gets close to or gets connected, threatens their fragile setup, so that person would have to be "dealt with" (probably killed or consciousness transferred over to somewhere else) -- meaning they just return back to their body. well, as more and more people get good at this, they can't possibly just kill anyone that's energetic. that's completely unsustainable and their planet will run out of people in a hurry, so they have to find a way of controlling and taking advantage of the energetic kids for as long as they can before getting rid of them.

they have to actually learn how to do this properly, but like I was saying to mom, knowing how LOA works, there's no way the US govt could possibly be still operational. it should have broke down and failed a long time ago with so many bad ideas. this situation would be even worse -- LOA's effect on them would be so storng, focusing on trying to control and get rid of stuff, that that this operation surely would fail or not get very far at all. there's no way it could last for any period of time, I reasoned.

well, when I woke up, I realised that it's probably not an alien race doing this, but actually fwh (my "future" self). because we think so much alike, I don't at all find this improbable. I would definitely do something like this. E' needs a source of sheep (E), but also a source of wolves (planet hope: H). in the same way that people on E' would continually get stronger and stronger, beating ever more difficult levels, the people on H would have to continue getting more and more controlling and unchanging in their ways.

---

let's take the subject of preparation for disaster. I have the perspective that preparation for disaster is exactly what attracts the disaster. funnily enough, if you skip the fear based sections of the gospels, written IMO after the timeline had split, where he talks about the "end of days" and gets people scared about that -- jesus exhorts us to "not worry" (mat 6:25-34). worry and preparation for those disasters is what brings those disasters

you can see that from the point of view for us her on E, we'll get better and better at creating our own reality, not letting circumstances, conditions, or the bad ideas that other people tell us to believe to interfere with our own craetion of reality. eg. if you're tuned into wellness, disaster can't become a part of your reality. those tuned into disaster will arrive on the scene attracting disaster, experience it, and then tell everyone, "see told you so! you need to prepare for it."

from the perspective of E', they will need to continue to try and avoid disaster and to prepare for and try and avoid the worst. you can see why this dream-life on E' is so compelling -- because we'll, through practice, get so good at knowing what we want to tune into, that creating whatever will become so easy and second-nature. anyone who can make it through the dream and get connected will be basically at the creative capacity of jesus (and much more) -- meaning that our desire to focus on well-being will be so strong, that anyone wanting to focus on disaster must create a time split.

so, you can see how this will become a problem over time for E' eventually the people being born there will be getting so powerful that they'll be getting more and more difficult to control. at the same time, you could imagine that because they have access to our timeline, they'll be able to track it (through my timeline) and see that we've gotten energetically so far ahead of them, there's no way they can possibly do a whole lot about it. I find it likely that depression will set in eventually as they realise the fuility of it all and begin to make their own choices about what it is they really want. these are the "souls" on H and H'. they'll eventually get there, but from the opposite direction. each iteration that they make, those consciousnesses who eventually give up on trying to control others' realities will likely be replaced by AIs who have been learning from them the whole time.

eventually, machines will run the world of E' making for a place where we can all continue to improve our creative capacity.

---

I'll be honest, I don't really understand the whole H and H' thing. I know there has to be an H' because fwh would have made a time split, too, and it's likely they're using their other timeline. I dunno.

also, now that I think about it, we're possibly H' and all of the hotshots from over there are the ones that want to go to the new timeline (E') because it'll be exactly what they want: a place where anyone can be manipulated to do whatever is wanted. there's no need for rape when you can manipulate them to consentually make your fantasies come true. so that world is really compelling for them. in the broader perspective though, that's really short-sided and totally misses the joy of creating the new thing that you want, instead of trying to manipulate what already exists.

I don't see it 100% clear yet, but it seems to me that probably the source of most of these hardasses are the "clones" that fwh talked about so often (and probably "controls") -- and repeatedly puts them in the situations which will create for us more contrast, so that they'll be "forced" to create their own timeline where they can control everyone. their timeline where they control everyone will continue to exist likely for a long time, and will probably be used as a "rite of passage" -- and they'll have an entire world (maybe soon a whole galaxy) where they control everything and maintain their technical superiority by stealing it from craetive people going through their dojo.  I'm glad someone wants to run a world like that becauso to me, I just don't thing it would be as fun as you might imagine it to be.


### 2020-03-21 07:28 - doing things my way

I'm in the process of beginning to feel the way I want to feel about things. how is it that I want to feel? I want to feel like I'm in control of my reality. I decide what I want to attract with my focus and therfore I'm in control of how I feel.

I realise that some people my disapprove of the way that I am going about it, but I don't really «give a rip» -- and the reason for it is, I don't really have anyone that can help me, and neither do I really want it. I know I can get there the way I'm going to go about it. it's probably not the fastest or the most optimum way either, but I think «you are addicted to the drama» anyway, so just let it play out. it'll be fine.

the thing is they are doing everything in their power to make sure I don't find a way to feel good. I can almost always be assured that any advice or help that people are giving me is to try and take that power away from me. let's take the example of cleaning my room. it's a total disaster. I hate living in such an untidy place. I really do. also, have you noticed that every time that I get stoned, I begin to start cleaning?

what's happening is, I feel good, so I want to be in a space that feels good, so I naturally begin to clean. when I feel good, I like things tidy and organised, I promise you. mom offered to help me to clean my room, and I think it's an OK idea, but I want to have the room relatively clean before she begins to help me. I think that nosebook wants me to rely on other people (females) to do things for me. you see, if mom were to come and clean up the room for me, but I never changed the chaos in my head -- my living environment is a reflection of the way I feel -- then, my room would go right back to chaos in a very short time.

for me, making action to change the way I feel almost never works. having a clean room, then going back to having a dirty room again is sorta like doing drugs (or going to a mediation retreat) to feel better, then when they wear off, life returns back to the chaos that it was previously. the only thing the drug did was to illuminate the contrast between the two states and produce stronger desire in me for what I want (which is a clean room).

I must first find my way toward feeling good. I have to become in control over the way I feel. I am taking steady progress toward that, and I am confident that I can get there. I prefer self-controlled contrast. if I control the contrast, then I can gain control over it. what I really want is control over my reality.

---

you may remember the picture illustrations that I made when I was at augustos house. in the first picture you can see a very stressed out version of me representing my left-hemisphere. this is where I'm at right now. that is me. that image symbolises the balance and equalisation of my two hemispheres (which is something that nosebook does not want me to have). the next picture, I say "it is done" and there is the headline "this is *my* reality" -- not "this is the reality nosebook wants me to have" or "this is the reality that people want me to have" or "this is the reality that someone else is in control of" -- this is *MY* reality.

as I begin to get better and better at feeling the way I want to feel, you will notice a whole different version of me. me and my entire reality (including everyone in it, because it's only attraction), will feel good, look good, etc. being around me will be like entering into an alternate dimension where everything is of such extreme quality and detail that everything feels visceral and delicious.

I'm obviously not there yet. I have to gain control over the way that I feel in order to get there. I anticipate that this is only the beginning of the difficulties, because what I'm essentially saying is that I will begin to feel the way I want to feel (amazing, good, successful, etc) -- not the way that nosebook wants me to feel which is powerless, in their control, and dependent or reliant on others, so they can control the way I feel by controlling the others. surely they will not respond to losing control like this, and much like a parent trying to fight with their child's desire, will try more and more physical methods to try and control someting that is way too strong for them to control.

---

I do feel pretty disconnected. I can't really feel anything anymore. I really don't know what to do about stuff because I just can't really feel much anymore. I consider it to be similar to flying an airplane in a situation without any visibility. you have to rely on your instruments, not your feelings. I'm essentially all logic based now because I don't have a very good sense (or I haven't found a way to reliably get the sense I'm looking for). when I don't feel the way forward, I don't make any action. I have to go on pure logic and my knwledge of how the universe and LOA works until then I regain my guidance system.

to all the girls that are going to make an effort to get included[^1], for now let's just remember you, and I'll revisit at a future time when I've got my senses back. that's probably to your advantage anyway because probably by that time I'm going to see really only see and attract the things I want (positive) aspects in those around me. so, for now I'll just say ok, remember that one or something like that.

I have tremendous confidence in the my understanding of things, and I'm really doing a lot of advanced techniques because I'm so sure of how it all works, but I just don't yet have the surity in what I feel right now. too much chaos still. you'll know when Im getting out of it, because my environment will reflect it. my room will probably be clean :)

[1]: yesterday, there was the one on villa st(?), the two on briargate (the house where I looked in their backyard after the wind blew their fence down). then, I felt something also with thad's neice too -- then most bizarrly of all when I was watching stars I kept feeling inclined to say that 10 (why ten, I dunno) french girls (selected by them), too. you can understand now, my aprehension to try and figure this out. logically, it would seem that some of that *has* be noise, rather than signal.


### 2020-03-25 10:40 - iterate it real good

last night after I came back from the last time losing consciousness in the field, I returned to watching stars and I had a funny sense come over me which was likely a reaction to whatever they are doing while I'm asleep. I assume they're working on their new timeline based on the reactions, but anyway... the feeling I got is that they're going to have to do a lot of iteration on their timeline until they get it. it felt to me like it was some sort of punishment or some form of hell, where they're forced to live out the conseuences of their situation until they fix it, in order to move forward.

imagine their case. this is just an example, and probably not the real version of it, so just go with it for the sake of example. imagine they can make their new timeline such that at the "end" of their new timeline, they decide to make a new timeline again, and go back to try again.. the reason why they would want to go back and try again would be because they want to optimise their situation and avoid some form of catastrophe.

you could say that the catastrophe will be caused by our solar system passing through the galactic current sheet, but I believe it's actually much more insideous than that. I think their difficulties arise internally, from such an accumulation of bad ideas.

imagine they get everything all setup and they're capable of making it through the galactic current sheet and everything. now, they're forced to face the reality of their own internal difficulties. each iteration, they're going to need to continually find their way around one corruption scandal after another, working thier way up to.. what? up to what? what is their end goal? certainly, if it's for the continuation of the organism, some bad ideas will need to be given up on so that the organisation can survive.

---

the situation I envisioned last night was kind of a funny one (not really though), but imagine that the noseboys were able to iterate so much such that they could get so high up in their form of perception that energetically, if they were to have sex with anyone not on their power level, the amount of electricity contained in their body would become harmful to the other person? I imagined the worst case: I imagined that it would cause death[^1]. in that far-out situation they would have to either stop having sex with humans, or just become ok with the idea that they must now have victims of their pleasure. or -- they would have to begin allowing the humans to rise up to a level so they can have sex with them. or, to select only certain authorised females which they could have sex with and allow them to be on a similar level with them -- but that would setup a group of females with superiority (which enevitably will expand).

this whole thought experiment was a test to try and see if I could come up with the worst possible outcomes in my brain. even though, it likely won't manifest in this form at all, I do know that the vibrational bit is sound. things will have some form of balance -- or, in other words, desire would never allow that to happen. it would create too strong of desire for that to continue to be a reality.

however though, there is a solution, and I think they'll arrive to it naturally, because I doubt there's even a chance that these guys will decide to change their ways; that's just impossible. so, each iteration, their version of reality will have to be more and more controlled by machines. this will help them to avoid the obvious corruption and infighting that will certainly take place. machines will have to be setup to run the entire world, in order to avoid these circumstances.

think about it like this: imagine that everything works out well, up until 2030, or something but in 2030, one of the main guys gets some idea that he needs to be paid more or receive more money because he's unhappy and this causes some huge problem. next iteration, they'll have to find out a way to ensure he doesn't get unhappy, so they make more ideal circumstances for him. similar things continue to happen until everyone in the company has to be put in some form of super ideal circumstances in order for the company to continue to function. the trend is to "buy off" (a technique used in a lot of corporations to get rid of problematic people) the probematic ones and put them into a situation where they're comfortable and not making problems. this will leave a core remnant of guys and means that team size is shrinking with each iteration, not expanding -- which means, more and more is being automated.

---

I think this is a good thing, because consider another reaction I had a few days ago, upon their begginning to realise that they are only able to control their small (infinitesimal really) "insignificant" slice of reality. I contest that it is insignificant so long as they look at purely from a numbers standpoint: 1/infinitiy = next to nothing, but if they're able to make an environment where *everything* is out of the humans control, and machines do the bidding of these godlike superhumans running the entire show, that *is*, something significant! why? because that means that an infinite number of us can continually use their planet as a sort of dojo to learn to value our connection above all other things. with everything out of our control, we'll gain tremendous practice to find that control inwardly.

also, it has a nice reciprocity to it. each of us will having experienced the contrast between connection and no connection, we'll learn to desire it more and more until it's a part of our makeup to search for that first. likewise, the core noseboys, will have a similar thing happening, where each iteration their realisation of something going wrong could theaten to take away their mega-perception, they too will gain stronger and stronger desire to find their connection. we'll eventually all be on the same page again, but have gotten there by different paths.

[1]: I imagined this as the most far out situation possible, which may or may not be a possibility, but just for extrapoation sake, it was what I came up with. the idea comes from what I believe was thoth's difficulty here on earth, and why he became so much of a loner.

### 2020-03-31 11:11 - thinking about what the buyoff thing means

one of the weird reactions I got to last entry's idea about the buyoff idea, is -- lemme back up a bit: one of the things that always puzzled me about one of the things that fwh said, is that "tesla reincarnaed in 2001" -- I was "reincarnated" (if I can use that term in such a loose way) in 2000, not 2001. the other thing that has always puzzled me is why he is the *former* white hat -- like he somehow converted to the dark side or something...

well, one of the major developments in the last few entries is that there's not just these two competing earths with timelines.. so imagine that nosebook goes and makes their own timeline, and we also have our own one too, that would make two earths -- or, two major timelines. however, recent developments (perhaps they're reactions even), I seem to be putting together the pieces of the puzzle of his crytic words, and they're beginning to paint the picture that fwh (and his idylwild group), are essenially in charge of making rediculous amounts of contrast, for our benefit.

he routinely talked about cloning people and weirdly talking about these strange things like russia being involved with some timewings or something hokey like that.

let me go back even further: this all started when I told mom that I think that the "world leaders" and the guys in charge I think are perhaps AI controlled by an alien race interested in creating contrast for our benefit. there's absolutely no possible way that these guys could actually sustain things the way they're running them. you simply cannot be focused that much on unwanted and have a system with that kind of uptime. LOA tells me this isn't possible, so something else *must* be happening for them to even come remotely close to the success they're having.

the more then that I thought about it, the more I realised that if I were given the opportunity to "convert to the dark side", and create (on purpose) and control a bunch of knuckleheads in charge of the world, creating disaster after disaster -- never so much that it's paralysing to the people, but just enough to force people to find their alignment instead of waiting for the world's conditions to improve, to begin find a way to feel good, I would *TOTALLY* do it.

knowing that the outcome of such an endeavour would be an entire earth populatation capable of jesus-like strength and resolve, it wouldn't bother me at all to set something like that up -- and my own belief and knowing that it would create (and bring out) truely the best in people (after some hundreds(?) of years of iteration). in fact, that is how I myself would prefer to learn: put me in a difficult siuation where I have no other option than to find a way to feel the way I want to feel, and put some great reward at the end.

if I could do that to myself, I would do it :) see where I'm going with this? then, imagine that people watching me go through this felt -- jealousy isn't the right word, but desire that they could have some similar thing happen to them -- well, then you have a whole planet of people desiring to learn things the "hard" way like I did, cause they see the reward at the end and also want that for theirselves.

combine that with the canopy of energy prevailent during this whole process that, "you can't just get something that wonderful for free; you have to *earn* it" add in the whole recognition that I was (and to some extent still am), a very addictive personality type, and the "reward" that comes at the end of this mind-numbing process (think facebook games) is some really great feeling. I'm essentially an example of a human's wildest desire in the sense that I'm an egotistical addict that found a way to leverage that to my advantage -- and that seems to have inspired quite a bit of desire in a whole lot of other people, similarly[^1] and I have essentially become a great example for people -- something they can see and say, well, if he can do it, then I guess it's possible.

---

so, I venture to guess that all of this timeline crazytalk I've been carrying on about, appears to be the taking shape to be the manifestation of those desires and energies.

what if the future of this planet were a place where eventually everyone were to be treated like I am now. the contrast would be so enormous, and the asking and the manifestation would also be, too.

---

so, when I said that tesla "reincarnated" in 2001, I have to imagine some 19 year old genius working for nosebook has quickly become someone very important in their company -- something easy to do when you're doing everything with your mind.

so now imagine that each time they need to make a new timeline (to get further along), there will people members of the team which will likely not quite make the cut, and will ge left behind. each iteration their capacity to control things will improve until finally I would imagine that the whole world is controlled by machines. I would also imagine that the very last iteration, only one guy will make the timeline and he'll (I assume it's a he, but it doesn't have to be) leave everyone too resistant to survive the galactic thing and the transition the earth is in the process of making.

the personality type of the last guy there would have to be one that is secretive, very concerned with efficiency (and therefore increasing the energy levels of the planet to achive that efficiency), someone very interested in gaining the efficiency of a machine, one who is mechanically interested in "incraesing human energy" as if it were a machine, a "loner", one who likes being single (cause a relationship with someone would compromise his creative energies) -- basically someone exactly like tesla would be the porfect guy to accomplish this becomming the guy who would want to make this perfectly contrasting environment for us where we have literally *zero* control over our physical experience, but only the option to learn to feel the way we want to feel (just like I learned to do).

tesla alluded to the idea that when he was youger he had audiory and visual hallucinations quite frequently, and it plagued him for some time before learning to control it. he never says, exactly how he learned to control it, but in various places he alludes to the idae that it was gaining emotional control, and his hallucinations directly followed the way he felt and what he had been previously thinking about or had just recently seen, recognising that his hallucinations and dreams always had the previous thing of that type that he had most recently seen or heard or gave his thought attention to.

it's also clearly obvious that tesla had some rare condition where his brain had enormous amounts of DMT in it. that would certainly explain his visual capability, his excellent eyesight, his hearing, hallucinations, and just about everything he considered to be a malady [TODO: lookup exact quote for what he referred to it as]. so, it's no surprise to me that a good portion of the population has had their DMT levels artificially boosted. it looks like it's kind of like the best of bost worlds. you get the DMT levels that tesla had, but without the hallucinations, but also without the abiity to conjure images in 3d space, which is considered a "hallucination" (like me).

eventually, only one person (this tesla type) running the whole show will have picture capacity. everyone else will have their hallucinations (ability to conjure images in 3d space) disabled until they they're capable (also like me) to find their alignment/connection.

---

so last night when I was star watching, the second time arond I got to looking at the lyra star when they took my consciousness away from me again. I came back and I had this overwhelming sensation that the guys doing the timeline either have already taken off, are going to take off, or maybe just mr. motor is fearing them taking off. however, I got this overwhelming sensation that they're going to peace out sometime, and when they do, all of their best guys are going, leaving the company crash and burn tremendously. the way it felt to me is that they would leave the ones that are not at all helpful in creating the new timeline -- the ones that, with their enduring fixation on unwanted, make the new timeline more difficult, so they just get left behind here. if all the talent and "alignment" leaves the company, that only leaves those with their perception fixated on unwanted, meaning things will fall apart all by theirselves. none of us have to do anything.

there are some more questions/reactions I'm feeling about this whole idea of fwh's planet hope feeding and controlling the knuckleheads, and this planet becoming the one that feeds the enlightened ones... it's a bit of a length more o write that. I'll get to it soon :) this is a tremendously enjoyable mental game (experiment) to play arund with in my mind.

I have felt like I do when I'm in a dream -- where I'm doing stuff, and stuff is happening, but it's all so bizarre, I don't recognise how anomalous it is until I start becoming conscious in the dream that I begin to understand what's relly happeining[^2].. simialrly, I feel like this is what's happening in reality for me. the mental game is a nice way for me to begin to become conscious -- because until then it just feels like a buch of really bizarre things happening that all feel really normal and not out of place.

[1]: thanks for the feeling you transmitted andreas in your icon lightend video. it feel this concept more clearly.

[2]: for example last night the first time I lost conscoiusness, I regained it in the middle of a dream. I was in an elevator that went was going down toward the groud so rapidly, that in the dream my feet weren't touching the ground -- I was floating. elevtors don't do that, and unless they were being propelled downward, your feet would never leave the ground as if you were in a weightless environment. the dream was so real, I consciously began making preprations for the impact when the elevator reaches the bottom, by lowering myself down to the ground so that I would bounce with the elevator when it came to the bottom. I kept trying to lay down on the floor, so that my spine wouldn't be compressed on impact, but I kept floating upward. turns out the elevawtor slowed down rather rapidly, I felt no deacceleration and woke up after trying to find a "weapon" ... I immediately realised that the incredible downward force I felt was the force that I feel when they do whatever it is they do when I sleep to remove all my energy, and I become conscious and they stop it, I almost always wake up with my feet and legs numb. I've begun to train myself to recognise that feeling as not what it appears to be in the dream, but the neutralisation of energy in my body -- so that I can more quicly become conscious in the dream (or not lose consciousness in the first place)

### 2020-04-01 12:37 - hooked on contrast (really) works for me!

one of the things that abraham always says is that you didn't come here so that you would have everything all laid out pefectly so you could just experience and enjoy them -- instead, you came to identify the desire and line up with it...

the more I've been getting used to this, every time I feel bad (for whatever reason), I know there's already a new really good feeling following it. I just have to find it and line up with it. it's really easy...

one of the interesting reactions that I got to the previous entry was that, "great, that means that it should be easy" -- well, I doubt it. a crash and burn of their magnitude prolly takes quite a while (years I imagine), and it'll create tons of contrast on the way. I don't think we're on the easy road.

### 2020-04-11 22:43 - the magic of mushrooms (and source)... lol

I wrote this whole long question thing out before listenening to the broadcast of the 9th, asking about mushrooms. I individually came to the conclusion this morning that I would attempt to grow the mushrooms, and if they didn't grow that's cool, and if they did, that's also cool, too. I had nothing to lose. I also decided that I wouldn't be trying to pin everything on one day, so instead of putting all of my eggs in my birthday basket, I would instead just try and grow a lot of mushrooms and use them as an accelerant, just like I do with the stars.

assuming I could get the mushroom production up and running, I reasoned that I would have to find ways to release resitance really rapidly because I would continue to increase the dosage until I'm stable at extremely high dosages. then, when I came back down, nosebook would ensure I didn't get that high again, which just like my star-watching, actually increases my capacity. I think the most safe and productive route will be to gain levels as rapidly as possible.

so I go outside later this evening to check on the cloud situation to see if I can watch stars, and I notice a bunch of mushrooms grew in the backyard. you have to understand how impossible this is. they grew in some woodchips that had been covered with dirt, pushed their way up through the dirt and all of this without a single bit of moisture. it hasn't rained or showed in a few weeks to a month now and the climate is quite warm. these aren't a suitable mushroom growing environment. I don't know how they grew, honestly. there's no way they should have been able to grow, I assure you.

it's a funny sign for me though, so I guess that solves the question I had... I'm going to try and see if I can grow a bunch more, and also eat the ones I have, hopefully accelerating this thing tremendously :)

sweet.


### 2020-04-15 14:11 - things might take a while...

this afternoon I went out to go take a walk and one of the things that I felt like I was feeling was the reaction that some girls should have some sort of priority. a little bit ago (I can't remember how long ago it was now), I felt like one of the responses to my previous questions about "go big or go home", it seemed to me like some sort of plans were beginning to be made.

I didn't really mind at first, because I don't really have much in the way of plans at all. my *only* objective is to get connected beforehand. there's no other real prerequisite than that.

so, with that in mind, when there were ideas coming into my head about some with more priority than others, I didn't really feel much resistance, and I went with it for a bit, but it became obvious that there would be quite a few with "priority" -- and I left it at that. I don't really think it's much of a thing to worry about, because I don't really think I'll be getting connected anytime soon.

if I had to guess, I would guess a year or so from now. however, as with all my time estimates, a good rule is to double it -- so two years or so, I guess. I really can't see that far ahead, and I don't really want to try, either. when I look out, there still seems to be so much to accomplish that I just don't see it happening anytime soon.

however, I will say there is one factor that may play a role here, and it's that I've been noticing that nosebook has been making a whole lot more mistakes recently. they simply don't have the iron grip on my energetic output like they used to, and I've had more and more frequent instances where I become conscious in dreams or whatever that they don't want me to have happen. so who knows, there... but even still, their rate of making mistakes isn't accelerating at such a rate where I could possibly believe they could make a huge mistake anytime soon, and certainly not in the next half of a year or so.

I do know that this summer will be a *huge* expansion of my consiousness, and I'm really not worried about it. I'm really enjoying where I'm at right now and the programming that I'm doing is quite a lot of fun, actually. I really don't feel like there's any need to try and rush anything.

after my last big programming stint, I slept like 20 hours straight, pretty much -- and one of the main influences upon my consciousness was initiated by this video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CameSDK-2m8), because it's the line where jesus (christ superstar) says, "whyyyyyyy must I die" -- which immediately puts in my brain the picture that terence mckenna puts with his quantum soliton of improbability -- where two timelines are created, one where jesus dies, and one where ho goes on to be the influence that propells humankind into a sort of super future of incredible growth and exapansion, while the timeline where he dies, things kind of go downhill.

I beiieve I'm in a bit of a similar situation, where two major timelines are being created. I have no idea what timeline my perception is on, and it doesn't really matter to me. the feeling that I kept getting when I would wake up during those long hours of sleep is that the manifestation (of the girls) simply woudln't take place.

you know, that doesn't really bother me all that much. abraham always says to, "not need the manifestation" -- and I've totally gotten there. if it happens, great, but it if it also doesn't happen, to be quite honest, it would be a bit of a relief for me. I honestly don't really have any confidence in things working out very well, unless I'm connected and can stay that way.

it may be a while. don't let it bother you. try to find yourself, like me where you're so much more enjoying the absence of the manifestation.

then, while the manifestation still feels overwhelming, that just means that it's bigger still than you're allowing right now, so then just enjoy the expansion...

this is what I mean by I'm sure that there is still quite a bit more expansion for me to go.

---

putting that in practical terms, I would have to imagine that in order for this to work out, I have to first get connceted (a while away), then I think it would be cool (if not almost necessary) if I actually have this website running and going as well, then I think it would be a much smoother transition. finally, if that's also the case, getting a round of finance for the "website" also would mean we could do the whole thing, without a single bit of nosebook's "help" -- forgive me, but I don't find them very helpful, if you know what I mean. I would really enjoy if we could finance the whole thing ourselves, and the girls are all getting a piece of the thing we're creating. it's an idea that has come up a few times while meditating now, and I know (for sure) that nosebook isn't putting that thought there.

maybe we want to hold out a bit until we can do the whole thing without their "help"...

maybe that's what's taking so long. if I think about it from a culmination of multiple different timelines, point of view, it means that all of our "future" selves are continuing to push us further and further down the timeline toward something all of us are collectively wanting to manifest. it may be this, or it may be something more... I don't know yet. we'll have to see.


### 2020-04-26 12:37 - appreciating the contrast

scruple: a feeling of doubt or hesitation with regard to the morality or propriety of a course of action.

jaron just got a new board game called "scruple" and I was looking through it because I found it fascinating. there are these dilemma cards which you're supposed to ask another person and then the person is supposed to lie about their response to the dilemma or to tell the truth. your goal is to get rid of your dilemma cards to win the game. that style of play makes your answers more loose in the sense that you never have to reveal how you really feel about the dilemma.

I find the dilemmas to be quite a funny thing because thanks to LOA I essentially don't need to worry about the majority of them showing up in my life, so I'm pretty much saved from having these dilemmas come up in real life. I realised then that by reading and focusing on these dilemmas, I am actually attracting these sorts of things into my experience much more than I would if I just lived life normally.

I started to read them, and I kinda got addicted to answering these questions. they revealed to me a whole lot that I hadn't really paid much attention to previously.

#### I have an extremely low opinion of law enforcement

in quite a few questions I would leave the person stranded or, simply not get involved just to avoid having to spend time in a police station or givng a statement...

in my experience, the police have no interest in actually providing any form of justice (I mean the system as a whole; not the individual police officers, which I am certain because I've met quite a few which are actually really decent dudes). actually to give a great example of this, when I gave my money to a cocked out guy the police that interacted with me were quite great guys. we chatted for many hours in the car on the ride up to san sebastian. I have no doubt that there are tons of great police officers; that's not my point.

my point is that the system in which they operate is terrible. when I had my laptop stolen, they knew exactly the guy who did it, and I'm sure they recovered the laptop from him -- however, because they had to keep their secrecy that they could not see through my eyes, I never got my laptop back. it's fine because I still had enough money to buy another one, but even still later when I didn't have money, their secret was still far more important than my well-being. agsin, it's fine because they're not the source of my well-being -- and just when I needed it marcos totally came through for me.

my point is, they aren't the police that you see on tv. that's a totally idealised (fictional) version that is almost entirely created in the writer's head to make an entertaining program which appeals to the audience's sense of justice. it has no basis on reality.

I've sat in the police station for probably more than 20 hours or more giving reports and stuff, and there has never been anything returned to me. their entire goal right now is to make sure that I *don't* have any money. I don't ever imagine that they will ever wish that I have any success either and probably perceive me as a huge liability, even though I am the reason why they have all of you in their network and tracked so well. they make who knows how much money off of me, and there's no way I'll ever see any part of it -- which again, is quite fine because they *arn't* the source of my well-being.

#### I will avoid helping someone or ensuring some sort of justice to avoid interacting with law enforcement

once again, for a lot of the same reasons, and I've always kinda been this way, but knowing what I know now about everyting being attraction, I simply do not want to get involved in something like that. if I am witness to seeing something, then I have to wonder what it is in my vibration that is attracting an experince such as that. I simply do not want to help people because the penalty for it is thrice:

1. focusing my attention on the problem attracts more of it into my own experience.
2. the other person has attracted the situation in the first place, and there's nothing that I can do about that.
3. I attracted witnessing the situation, so that is illicitiing a response from me. in those cases there is something then that I can do (or else it wouldn't have happened in my experience, because no longer do I have the vibration of a helpless bystander of some attrocity)

#### most of the situations I actually would react in response to what I feel

I began to notice that a lot of the situations, I can't just hear the "hechos" (deeds/actions) and make an immediate decision as to how to respond. I instinctually follow how I feel now and in a quite a few (most) of the cases, I don't think I would do the response I was asked about, but do something entirely different. meaning, I don't think they offered the best response, and were forcing me to say yes or no I would make action on what I think is a mediocre response.

---

the game is a long slog of trying to solve something with limp action, when energetically it makes no real sense at all. the game kind of inspires me a bit to reframe the ideas a bit and to take a more feeling approach to some of the questions. I'll experiment with the idea on jaron next breakfast and see how it goes. until then, enjoy reacting to, and the resulting contrast provided by of some of my extreme responses :)


### 2020-05-01 07:38 - bad feeling reaction?

last night I was walking out to the field and I had this really good feeling thing pop into my head because I was noticing as I was star-watching last night that it seemed like the difference between "how real" the manifestation of the girls thing was at the beginning of the night and then, when I was walking out (~3:30), and I was really feeling like it was all kinda falling into place, and everyting was good.

the thought was was coming to me was how much I just didn't need to try and force something, make it happen or even effort things into place. you see, I had just been having the thought on my mind about the whole computer shutting down thing, and I was thinking also about how I took a detour trying to get my database working the hard way, yet instead I have since decided that I'll just force myself to learn ecto, even though it appeared to me super complicated at first.

anyway, so I was thinking about how I was going to try and effort the database into place and try real hard to get it all ready. when I was walking out there, I had this great feeling that even though it appears like the whole computer shutting down thing was a loss of time, it is more energy added into the equation, and there are some positive aspects to it too, most namely it's great practice for me even more to get better at getting into the "zone". I can do now in just a few hours what used to take me perhaps days or weeks, previously. it's also improving my capacity to hold the concept in my head, even through an interruption (and I'm sure there will be interruptions with so many different girls), so it's kinda ok -- actually.

---

anyway, so as I continued to watch stars, I noticed a lowering down of feeling, and I'm pretty sure it was various reactions in response to my monologue last night about not needing to worry about the timing. I (probably foolishly) gave an example of what I thought was the *worst case* scenario, which I believed with my current progress, I could pretty much guarantee that I'll be pretty well connected by the end of the year.

I don't really know how it'll happen. I don't know if just at some point I'll surpass their ability to contain the energy in my body and it'll be like an avalanche, or if -- like esther -- source will just kinda take over and nuetralise their neutralisation. I don't know. I tend to think and acually believe that it'll be more of the first than the second. perhaps a combination of the two when all of the moving parts are in place... I really don't know.

but, that's what I was saying last night -- it just gives me the feeling of so much freedom to know that I don't need to worry about any of it at all. I just need to keep following my good-feeling inspiration and that's it :)

so, I guess, if my monologue made you feel bad in some way[^1], just know that your inner being isn't looking at it the same way you are. it felt good to me and I'm certain that everything is fine. I promise.

[^1]: there was a whole lot of "he's going to drag this out forever" or "this is going to take foreever" -- and another one that had to do with coronavirus that I didn't understand, but I didn't care to investigate further, either.

### 2020-05-10 00:25 - coming enlighnenment

I just watched a series of interesting videos on past times, which made me want to write a long comment about what I thought about modern "initiation" and "enlightenment" compared to times past.

@[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPixqRq-zXg) 28:40 - in regard to the 16 figures with the heads of birds, and 32 with human heads...

I have often wondered about why there are so many depictions of various "gods" with wings, and also with quite a few as birds (especially notable also in egypt). I think these figures represent a series of "rulers" -- 16 of them the original "gods" -- which are depicted as birds. then, there were 32 humans which are depicted with wings.

there is a similar motif with the sumerians. ancient architects did a video on sumerians in south america here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8NnX2ObQwA)

the principal video that I think shows this bag, the tree of life, and pinecone motifs can be seen here: @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvdrkSUVn70)

in it, he talks about how there were original "gods" that walked with the humans, and taught them things. they are always shown as the birds and hold bags in their hands. the initiation ritual is to open up the pinecone and the tree of life, which represents enlightenment and is said to give wings.

this sort of thing appears in a lot of different sources, but it seems to me that, going by the theory of the different pacha stages of humankind, the earliest stage, the gods walked with the humans, and these gods were the birds. they initiated humans and taught them "enighenment" -- and so subsequently these initiated humans also had wings (were able to fly).

it seems there are natural flying gods, and then humans rulers or gods which were initiated in some way to gain the ability to fly.

---

(sidebar) another interesting thing to note here is the reptile/bird symbolism. we know that numerous dinosaur birds (pteradactyl) simply would not be able to fly in gravitic conditions of today's earth and we also know that dinosaurs were likely feathered beasts and are the predecesors to the modern bird. I don't really know what to make of it, but it is noteworthy, considering that (following the pacha theory) that gravitic changes caused by the earth moving away from the sun god could easily explain the extinction of the dinosaurs (which later evolved into birds). science believes that earth's gravity is actuually a universal constant, but I believe that is geocentrism and very unlikely.

---

so, this doorway, I think could be symbolising the transition from the first (hanan pacha) where we had direct connection to the sun god, down to the second pacha.

an interesting thing to note here too is that the megalithic work of the 1st pacha is very curved and natural, as if the stone were able to be moulded, then the second pacha, seems that things are now all right angles and straight lines.

therefore, I'm going to go out on quite a limb here, it seems quite probable to me that in the 1st pacha, the bird gods, and probably the initiated humans were able to fly, mould rock and lift it effortlessly with their minds. I believe this is a function of the mind and is much more off limits to us now because of our distance from the sun.. so, as the earth transiioned to the 2nd pacha, this style of masonry and travel became more difficult, and so proper conditions needed to be met to be able to achieve these capabilities: now, angles and numbers and astrological conditions needed to be paid close attention to for those initiated in the secrets (masons) to be able to achive.

I think that the pyramids and other such structures were methods by which to use angles and maths and sciences to create conditions in which humans could become gods and return back to this garden of eden-like environment of mental non-resistance of a dream-state-like reality. this was probably kept a big secret from everyone, and people were only given the watered-down version of this mental state in the form of religion.

finally, we're now in the 3rd pacha now and we're considerably more separated from the sun god and all of this stuff is still possible but because the conditions (distance from the sun) and the other energetic conditions produced by the pyramids, etc.  all of this stuff is a complete mystery to us, but I believe that these sorts of mental states can be achieved within the person without the energetic conditions previously provided by our distance to the sun or the operation of these geometrically tuned structures.


### 2020-05-11 07:10 - a strange idea about the coronavirus

the previous entry spawned a lot of new discussions in my mind, to which I will continue on that thread in the future..

however, this morning, I woke up with a strange idea that perhaps the coronavirus is actually what we're calling the physical manifestation of people all over the world's frequencies being raised.

the idea was that as I continue to get vision upgrades, instead of letting the gap between me and others continue to widen, they are actually putting people up to my speed, and the result of this is if it's oo fast for you, you'll begin to have physical difficulty.

---

I have no idea if it's true or not, and you may say, "but I definitely don't see as good as kenny does, so that's impossible" -- but just because you don't see like I do, doesn't mean that your brain isn't being clocked to that speed. they do blur people's vision, as they are already doing with mine: -- have you noiced that everyone can see out of my eyes better than I can? the other day I had a pretty signicant vision upgrade where things changed quite considerably, and jaron complained about having a lot of pain that morning when trying to get up. I also noticed that his vision was much more blurry than usual as well, because he couldn't see a black square at a distance (something that I can see, and I usually have a harder time than he does at seeing things)

this obviously means to me that they're keeping jaron on par with where I am, but because he's still got quite a bit more resistance than I do, he probably does not see the same as I do, even though his brain is going at the same speed. this further implies that perhaps jaron's brain may be used to provide "imagination" for people on the lower end of the spectrum, and mine is used as the upper end of the spectrum. I doubt that there are others that are further along than I am, but I don't know if jaron is beign used to provide imagination for the lower end of the spectrum or not. that's completely unknown to me.

it could also be that they're putting everyone up to my speed, and I'm only noticing the effects that must be happening to quite a few in jaron. if what's happenining to jaron is also happening to pretty much everyone[^1] in the first-world, it would make sense therefore that people are being clocked up to my speed, even if they haven't released resistance in order to get there. it just makes for a more intense ride, if you're thoughts have more power because you're running at a faster speed.

it's probably a good idea that we're on lockdown while this continues to happen, because in our normal everyday stressful lives things would be much more intense, and this is a way to kind of mitigate the amount of extra stress and conflict that would otherwise be generated.

---

it seems that at the same time, they're really trying their hardest to keep me from going up as fast as I want to go up. I've been sleeping a *LOT* lately.. like 16 hours a day or so, and I have pretty severe lethargy, which they (abraham) also mentioned in the previous episode that's only evidence that I'm not letting all of me through -- which means there's still more resestance.

regarding the resistance that seems to keep coming out of nowhere after I wake up from sleeping, I believe that something happens when I'm asleep, and I don't really know what, but there's a definitel hour or two after I wake up where I'm a complete zombie empty of energy, but after a little bit I'm back up and feeling better again.

I've been getting a lot of vision upgradess without even watching stars, so I think what's happening is that I wake up at say 200 units of energy, and say the next vision upgrade is at 800, I manage to get there even without watching stars or anything. I just get back to thinking thoughts that don't block that non-physsical energy from flowing. the longer I'm awake and clear minded, the more this effect is, and the more energy I accumulate and I get vision upgrades. seems every time that I release more and more resistant thought, the more rapid I build up to getting to the next energy level where the upgrade is -- so that's probably why I'm sleeping so many times per day right now.

---

as a result, I think it's of benefit (for you guys) that things are going kinda slow. if I were to just go really really fast, I would basically get connected really really quick and you all would be kinda left behind in that way, however by doing it this way, you all are essentially going through your initiation like I described in the previous entry with the sumerian bag @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvdrkSUVn70) and your pinecone (pineal) is being slowly opened as I continue to get more and more vision upgrades.

therefore, I think it's actually beneficial if this process takes even longer than is presently expected, so that you can all continue to go up with me. I realise that there is a bit of expectation around my birthday, but I would instead just say that we should continue to go up slowly and not make any huge jumps. the ones along the way (in the first-world contries) who can't figure out a way of operating at the new speed will get the "coronavirus" -- then, with the new physical condition, they can either figure out how to recover from it and operate at the new speed or make their transition (if in fact the idea that I woke up with this morning has merit).

[1]: the reason I say pretty much everyone, is because in the last episode of abraham now (2020-05-07) they mentioned that people were seeing more, and this was the day of the major vision upgrade I think -- and they also said that there are a lot of people unaware of the coronavirus and are also completely unaffected by it.

### 2020-05-11 11:49 - quick answers

#### why do I think it's a good idea that we go slow and more make it up?

imagine life like a giant wide-open arena (mostly flat terrain) with a bunch of cars driving around in it. imagine that some of the people can actually see through their windshields and others have quite a while since their last carwash. while most of the people right now are not required to drive around right now (or drive very little in isolated areas), the time will soon come when we're all driving around again.

there's a catch though: the relative speed of their car is not determined very much by their brake pedal; the brakes are sluggish and don't really let you slow before too much of a minimum speed, while the gas pedal is very rapid[^1]. so let's say that the slowest of cars (when they're not awake) all go between 150-250mph, but never less (until they park it by going to sleep).

some people will have decent conditions to drive in the arena, meaning that they can afford a regualar car-wash or working windshield wipers or whatever (the metaphor is really breaking down here) to have more optimal driving conditions. while only some of the population actually has decent visibility in their cars, additionally, only some will actually know how to drive at that speed. some will have both.

you can tell that if you have more optimal conditions like a clean windshield and a responsive car (or the money to continually replace and repair any damage caused by our reckless driving), that you don't need to know how to drive, because your conditions are good enough you a much better chance of avoiding serious damage[^2].

back to the question: why would I think it's a good idea that the energy rise slower allowing peole more time to acclamate to the energy, giving more people a chance to become "enlightend"?

it's more contrast. otherwise, the arena would be very empty, with only a few people driving around fast. clearly you want to have more people and more opporunities for an impact, so that the mediocre drivers get good fast, the bad drivers can make a quick turnaround and learn to drive, and the good drivers can become excellent really rapidly.

there's more that I think it's beneficial for in the longer-term as well, which I'll mention soon enough.

#### something about widening the gap of superiority between the first and the third-world

I don't know how to describe this reaction in words, so I'll just talk about it. first, it's not my decision. if you want to know about the details you need to talk to nosebook. I don't make the decision about who gets to run at my brain's speed or not. I am purely focused on releasing any resistance that arises, to ensure that I continue on in progression toward releasing enough resistance that I'm so chronically connected that the girls thing happens.

I think though, that you all agreed to it by wanted to run your brains at my brain's speed, so that you could be apart and witness the broadcasts. the only thing that's happening this way, is I'm going slowly up to the 5th dimension and you all are coming with me.

don't worry about the third-world though -- and if you insist that it's something to be worried about, let me know how that works for you. when you worry about that, you probably (most assuredly) feel quite bad about it. that is your first indicator that your source does not perceive it the same way. in fact, the reason why a lot of this whole coronavirus thing is happening is because there is a whole lot of (probably from the topics of conversation around the election) comparison and focus on the disparity between the different classes of income and such. some of them may feel jealousy to us, but it's quite possible that they'll look at us about the way that we look at the characters in the illiad -- thinking that we live in a dysfunctional madhouse. it's all perspective.

#### do I think that people will fly?

probably. I don't know if it'll be right away or not, but as people get better and better at driving, they'll release enough resistance that they'll be able to feel light enough to take off.. it'll likely happen, yeah. you may be thinking that you may want to learn to drive fast first, though.

#### do I think there will be conditional drivers that can fly

almost certainly. there's no reason why -- I can't think of, anyway, that conditional drivers won't be able to also find a way to do that too.

#### will flight be like a college degree?

I imagine it'll also likely be like anything else vibrational, where you will either need good enough conditions for it to occur, or you'll need to have released enough mental resistance. until the conditions of the planet provide enough to allow flight, it may be that we're going to be kinda on the edge between feeling enough freedom to fly or not, and you may have times when you're not capable of flight because emotionally you're not in a good enough of a spot.

when the energetic conditions of the planet provide enough of a feeling of well-being, even if you're in a tough spot, or you live in the third-world, anyone who wants to probably can. I guess, before then, we (the guys in charge) can maybe enact laws so others feel safe, to descourage flying under emotional distress -- or something :)

[1]: ever wonder why so many of the stories of these ruling "gods" on planet earth in past times seemed to have extremely rapidly accelrating tempers and virtually no control over it? I think they really were "enlightened" :)

[2]: it's no wonder the previous ruling class always needed much more optimal conditions with a reduction of things that could make them feel bad -- moreso, than the people under their rule, anyway -- because if they could have been in such awful conditions under that kind of "enlightenment", it would have been a *very* rough ride, indeed.


### 2020-05-14 11:49 - illusions and "overpowering" nosebook

a few times I had questioned how I would get past nosebook's effect on me, postulating that I might "overpower" them, and simply summon/channel more energy than they're able to control. to some degree, I'm kinda right, but I understand it a lot better now and I thought it might be good to explain, because this is the "secret" to understanding what I was talking about in the last entry about the "initiation"... (which was only the name I gave it, because of the "tree of life" and the handbag symolism)

it's not really an initiation in the sense that it's a ritual to increase one's enlightenment through an energetic means, even though that may very well happen with people participating in the broadcasts, and it most likely will be for the girls. in a sense I have been using conditions such as stars or drugs to artificially increase my energy levels, so sex or participating in the broadcast will certainly fall into that category, too.

however, what it really is, is -- ever notice how abraham always says something like, "your cork will rise if you don't do that thing you do to hold it down." -- well, that thing we do is, find excuses to feel bad.

lately, I've felt it's important to take a stance where I'm no longer fighting against things. by nature, I go till the bitter end with a battle. I was one of those kids that didn't sleep, and fought it until the end because I thought I was missing out. I fought against everything that I didn't feel was the way I wanted, and that made me pretty fearless. I've told many times about how, with the mushrooms, I learned not to fight agaist those things and to just accept them as more energy. this is, in combination with what abraham teaches, in combination with a huge importance on emotional awareness, my "message"

I only call it a message because I don't really know what to call it, but as I continue on here, you will find, and I am and will soon be proving that once ypu can hold the emotion that you want to feel, reality *must* conform to how you feel, and there is no physical strength stronger than it.

---

the last few days I have noticed that every time that I would begin to get some momentum in my programming and start to really feel good about what I was creating, my computer would get shut down. that kinda sent me into a bit of a downward spiral for a bit -- however if it was night, I would just go star-watch, even though I could tell there was mounting desparation in me, because I couldn't figure out how, if I can't get momentum on it, would I ever finish it.

I came to the conclusion that the arbitrary deadline of my birthday simply would not be reached, and there's no problem with that because coming to that conclusion made me feel quite a bit better. so I feel less stress there, but the goal is not my programming. the goal is «joyous expansion» -- with the emphasis on the *joy* bit.

so, I simply have to find a way to "redefine" my reality in a way which makes me feel good about my circumstances/conditions. then, when I no longer use the conditions or circumstances as a reason to feel bad, my "cork" will continue to rise, and I'll eventually "overpower" them, because there will no longer be anything that can pull my cork back down by feeling bad, and it'll simply continue to rise and rise.

---

so, what I think this means in the bigger picture is that as we continue on, there will be more and more reasons (unjustices, etc.) to feel bad as the new gods[^1] continue to gain more and more power and influence and seemingly "lord" it over the uninitiated masses.

these are all conditions designed to make you feel less-than, or insuperior to them -- and therefore bad. previously it was economics that was used as the class system, but it looks to me like we're returning more back to how things were in the the first pacha[^2], where abundance was "normal" -- so the class system had more to do with perception and "magical capabilities".

the coming times are the age of the "physical" (7th ray) and, is why I believe there are so many autistic people being born. it's the age of magic, where physical manifestation becomes very rapid.

---

ok, so now on to the last topic here, which will tie it all together: illusion. since the recent encounter with the mother of the neighbour in front of me (he father is mike), I have been giving more and more thought to illusion, because she's a very illusory person. I perform illusion all the time, but I'm not totally aware of it. I am a much more simple person in the sense that I have to follow my emotion, and by doing that, my "inner being" makes a whole lot of "illusions" for you guys.

so, what is an illusion? an illusion is the ability to perceive reality the way you want to see it. most people try to use their imaginagion and conjure up the details of what that reality should look like, and then try to prove that to others. I call that lying. abraham calls it «saying things that are not vibrationally accurate». when you say something you do not feel, it is vibrational inaccuracy, and so I was realising as they were talking that I say things that I feel which are not yet manifest.. to most, I'm sure it sounds like lying, or making things up, or maybe even an illusion...

yet, because I feel them so strongly, they are vibrationally accurate. now, personal vibrationally accuracy isn't like an absolute thing.. you can be feeling really awful, and say some really awful things and be vibrationally accurate. that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about saying things you don't feel (whether the thing is good-sounding or awful-sounding) -- so, saying something negative when you really feel quite optimstic, or saying something optimistic when you feel quite negative.

importantly, as the way you feel changes, so will the things that you say. you will notice looking back though this document that I said a lot of things that were not "true" -- but they were vibrationally accurate, and they did improve as I continued to feel better and better. in fact, this document is sort of a journey toward feeling better, because all of the things I wrote were in resonance with how I felt at that time.

---

knowing that, I must now define an illusion as perceiving something in perfect harmony with the way you *feel* -- yet it is not in harmony with the way others perceive it (which they call "reality"). it's nothing special really; everyone makes illusions from time to time, but most people are trying to make illusions from their imagination, instead of from their emotion.

so, the formula is really really simple: if you can find a way to perceive your environment/reality in a way that feels good, there will no longer be anything that can make you feel bad, and you will continue to feel better and better.

so, in a sense, the initiation ritual is your your circumstances and how you perceive them.

---

I'm going to make a bold claim here and say that this is the true test of the step-5 master: every single thing has someting wanted and unwaned that can be perceived in it. when you no longer perceive the unwanted part, you are a step-5 master. -- and, I believe that step 6 is the realisation that you *are* source energy -- a god, in human form. when there's no longer any resistance (there's never exactly zero resistance) left if you, you wield source energy: that is, the energy that creates worlds.

you can use (energetic and pleasurable) conditions to try and boost your way up to getting a lot of this power, and I believe this is the foundation upon which this coming age is built. there will be lots of have and have-nots, but *everyone* can find a way to perceive the illusion that they want to feel.

[1]: oops, I need to explain this and I will more in a future entry, but the short version is that the new "gods" that will oversee the planet, will choose to inititate the ones that they want to initiate, and the rest of the population will appear as if they're unable to get to their status. this is, of course, not true.

[2]: actually, I think that this sort of "magical" time also happened again in the second pacha, and that was at the time/height of atlantis.


### 2020-05-19 11:39 - weird experience this morning

I had a weird experience this morning that I cannot really remember very well, but there are two things that I do remember: the first was me saying that no matter what happens, my perception is independent from other peoples' in the way that let's say something "bad" happens -- well, I don't really think that I'll be the one to experience it, even if all of you "see" it. I then went on, to talk about how it's sorta like if they (nosebook) were trying to get me to dream a dream I don't want to dream, it's possible that they would experience that dream that they were trying to get me to dream, and I would continue on to experience something else entirely.

the other part I think had something to do with me refusing to compily with their desire to make things happen on my birthday. I don't really think it's necessary to try and make something happen, because -- I just don't. somewhere around there I had this weird feeling where all of a sudden I felt compelled to say something that surprised even me: I said that I was aiming for galactic consciousness.

when I said that, it was accompanied with a "picture" as well, where I could see something to the effect that -- well, you know the rubberband analogy that abraham offers all the time, where they say that is what causes these quantum leaps. well, it looked to me like there were a lot of people that have achieved planetary consciousness, and most likely there have been some that have achieved solar consciousness, but I'm aiming to achieve galactic consciousness.

that surprised me, because I (kenny) didn't really know that in my physical form, even though there has been a lot of evidence (written here and elsewhere) that that is in fact what I'm shooting for... kinda crazy, but I (kenny) don't really think it's impossible. the idea kinda excites me a bit even.

---

then, when I was upstairs eating breakfast, and I saw the neighbour and then I started feeling some things about how I would delay the thing on my birthday. this spun me off into a whole bunch of different but related subjects which I'll mention a few of them here...

I was immediately reminded of the previous entry where I wrote about people flying. the concept was somethting to the effect that I would pull the rubberband back so far that people here in the first-world would become very very energetic because I would just continue on delaying and delaying and delaying for quite a long time and people would continue to be pushed up higher and higher, about as much the humans with wings on the sumerian tablets and the sun-gate, and although nosebook would try to keep down and prevent them from flying (they seem very concerned about this), the energy would still be so much more than otherwise, and there will be a lot of people in very high places.

the way I saw it, is imagine that those attached to my form of perception would be continuing to go up, and the higher end of them reach solar perception, but because nosebook is working so hard to keep them down, they only have the capabilities of planetary perception. there may be levels inbetween but, for now let's use the simple approach and say that people with planetary perception will also be held down to never really reach past I dunno... 4d or something.

I want to take time to explain that I don't really know what plantary, solar, or galactic perception is. if I had to guess, I would guess that planetary perception is what I had previously called 5d -- where you see all around you in all directions and you see inward in all directions too. solar perception, I have no idea. I see things clearly when it comes to dimensions of perception because I can extrapoate easily. I would guess that it's just a higher level of 5d. I know from my experience in 4d, there are quite a few levels between what I first experienced and what I experience now. it's probably more of that.

if I continue on to extrapolate, after 5d comes 6d .. so, just like 4d is to 3d, now there's an extra dimension that's always been there and you're looking right at it, but you don't see it, until your perception expands. this can be explained by realising multiple perception where everything is all connected.

I can imagine that I'll get there one day, because that's pretty much what source sees -- and then further dimensions on top of that would have to be non-physical dimensions. so, that gives further evidence to the difference between planetary and solar perception is just an expansion of your aura and a broader scope to your physical vision, meaning your consciousness could be able to move around instead of anywhere on this planet (most call this astral perception or remote viewing), to anywhere in the solar system.

now, since nosebook has so many secrets, I sincerely doubt they will want people to have the ability to focus their consciousness anywhere on the planet, or even the solar system -- so I find it quite likely they'll need to try and ensure that doesn't happen.

---

the next concept was that the new class system will likely, instead of economics, become one of perception, and nosebook will be the ones that allow some people and not others to have those levels of perception.

at the same time, people who feel good, and those who can benefit from the condition of participating with me and the girls, all around the world will be getting a boost as well. consequently, their level of perception will continue to rise just like mine has been doing. the people who don't feel so good will be sorta stuck, unless they're buddies with nosebook and nosebook can take off the limitations and give them the boost their looking for (or something like that).

that's all four groups:
1. those that feel good and have the boost by the conditions (like me)
2. those that feel good and don't have the conditional boost (available in third-world countries)
3. those that don't feel good and have the condiitonal boost (likely are getting support from nosebook or have some sort of beneficial condition to boost their perception -- perhaps even drugs, if people finally figure out how to use them properly)
4. those that don't feel good and don't have the conditional boost (third-world countries and stuff. if they're connected to my form of perception, these guys won't last too much longer with the increasing energetic conditions)

ok, now double those cases accounting for those connected to my form of perceptioin and those who are not.

... now that I've convoluted the matter, to the point: some will have conditions that can boost their perception and some won't. some will feel good and some won't, so essentially, those with the most to benefit will be the ones with beneficial conditions -- however, since LOA is what it is, if you don't want to find a way to feel good, it's going to be a pretty crazy ride.

it's going to be absolutely hilarious I say; totally banannas.

if you were listening in to my thoughts, I likely just explained the part that you didn't get (I think differently now :)). my thuoughts were thinking about how women (symbol for repceptive people) will be getting the biggest boost here, and it's probably going to be the turning point where the receptive ones begin to gain power and eventually overtake the assertive ones so dominant today.


### 2020-05-20 2020 00:50 - some new thoughts

I just went out "star-watching" (more on that later, because I've discovewered how to do it without stars) and I noticed how much different I felt and I was reminded of yesterday... which was I think the morning of the 18th. I was out there and I was focusing on the light in the distance, and I felt quite a bit as if I would be able to make the deadline of my birthday or even come pretty close. I feel that way now, as well. later, I went out walking to look at the airport and when I was walking back I noticed that I could see the sun, so I stopped to do a quick sunwatch.

I had these crazy experiences where it in the moment of staring into the sun, it felt like the fog in my eyes parted for a moment and I felt as if the whole thing was real, and there was this crazy realisation of how it would be as if I were looking back at it from fifty or a hundred years into the future -- and from that perspective I could see that people's study of me would be something like how we see the bible these days. it's ancient technology and doesn't really capture in a meaningful way (compared to HD films or nosebook's tech) the situation. I was in a moment where the technology was so immersive, people had knowledge of english/spanish sorta like how we have knowledge of ancient greek or hebrew.

it was sorta sad for me in a little bit of a way because nosebook's tech captured such a limited amount of my experience (the physical), and because of the language barrier of english/spanish, it felt to me like very little of what I experenced was actually captured.

---

it was interesting to me how different I felt then to how I was feeling the morning after I woke up. I was thinking about this looking into the light, and I came to the conclusion that I had to figure out how now how to feel like this anytime that I want. right then, I had a complusion in my voice like I mentioned in the experience this morning about the galactic consciousness this morning and the voice said something like, "remember the command" or something like that. it was an interesting idea. I'll explore it further I guess. I wonder to turn an emotion into a command. seems like they're not exactly 100% compatible, but anyway...

so, it may not be exactly that day, but it feels like it'll be close enough. I don't think there's anything to worry about; as abraham says, «you can have it all», right?

I suppose I'll be working on figuring out how to increase my command over emotion.

---

I also want to mention how nice it was to talk with john michael today after talking about planetary, solar, and galactic consciousness. it tied in perfectly, and I hadn't, up until that point, made the connection that a higher spirituality mind is just seeing the bigger picture -- and looking from the planet's point of view, there have been lots of different cycles of human life on this planet, but by far we are the most improved version of the creation so far. cycles are important, but just like how we're not worried the death, and destruction happening inside of our bodies when we're sick. as a human, we are concerned with the acticvities of the day, not the individual cellular warfare happening on the inside of our body. it worked out perfect timing :)


### 2020-05-20 19:29 - some thoughts on reemerging into the pure positive energy that is you.

before I went to sleep I finally listned to the 2020-05-12 broadcast. they said at the end that step 6 is about reemerging into the pure positive energy of who you really are.

I really liked that and have been giving it some thought, because, while I do think that galactic perception sounds -- big and stuff, and like something no one has done before. this form of perception in step 6 interests me *MUUUCH MUCH MORE*. I began to speculate immediately on it have already formulated a lot of different ideas about it.

I could see something that I hadn't really noticed before -- and that is that the emotional layer is a barrier between your perception through the lens of only phsicality/imagination and the one above it: the source version of all of that. the same must be true on the upper end of things as well, looking down: the structure/logic layer serves as a barrier between your perception of only desire and relations/interactions and the source version of that.

similarly to what I was experiencing in my understanding that when I'm a step 5, meaning that I no longer have an emotional response to things differing from how my source does, then I reemerge into that energy. the same must be true then for the structure layer -- meaaning that when my logic and structure are in alignment with my source's, then I get access also from the top down. anyway, I don't yet understand that much, but I wanted to throw it out there.

next, seeing as I've given a lot of thought to adding two more layers at the top and bottom, that would mean that adds a new barrier: the physical layer. so for the bottom-most layer, remember this one was like a 3rd person perspective in a film where you're so far removed from who you are, the barrier now for this new layer is the physical one. imagine how difficult it would be for a movie character to want to become physical and live in the world that we live in with LOA and all sorts of stuff. instead, it's more likely they would prefer to remain in the comfort of the imatination of the narrator and continue on in a contrived world where things are already planned out and set into stone -- you just have to act the part.

anyway..

---

the next bit is one about the "reemerging" part -- which is death. we've heard a lof of this symbolism before if you've ever been around a christian. john (the baptist) based his whole ministry on the value of near-death experiences and the freedom gained from letting that "self" die. in psychedelics, it's similar to a NDE, and they call it the "disilluion of the ego" or "ego death". it's all the same -- that's what I'm referring to. it's coming into the full and knowledge of who you *really* are.

does that mean my body dies and I take on an energetic form? probably not, though I wouldn't rule it out, because that's probably the direticion one would want to go upon gaining step 6.

---

lastly, before abraham gave their version of step 6, I had always said that step 6 is realisation of the knowledge that you *are* source energy. people seem to wonder why I tend to place so much emphasis on the bit that you *are* what you call God or you *are* source. and the reason for that is because if you do not really know this, then the laws of the universe are just a magical incantation to try and twist God, the universe, or source's arm to try and get what you think you want. this is unfortunately how it appears most egyptians interpretted what thoth taught...

without the recognisation that you are this big thing that you're trying to exploit to give you what you want (as if it were a bigger version of your most generous parent) -- then, it's just a magic ritual. knowing that you're coming into alignment with yourself instead of something external.

it's really important! and you get there by paying attention to how things feel, and paying attention to the source of those feelings. you begin to recognise the source of good feelings (pleasure, another person, something interesting, etc.) as not all being equal. the one that that feels the best and is absolutely what everyone is looking for (but you don't have to wait until you die to experience it), is found simply by paying attention to how each of these things feel, and how their results turn out.

that's it for now :)


### 2020-05-24 17:47 - an agreement?

first, I want to talk about a few interesting leading up to this. last night I was monologing about things -- about how I think all of this is a huge effort to ensure that I never work on tech. it seems that they have this tesla technology in place all over the earth and because it's such a powerful technology, it gives them the advantage that they need to feel superior. I don't really feel inclined to talk about it in depth here, but I'm sure I will more in the future.

it doesn't really matter though because everything that I've learned shows me that, while they may have quite an advantage in tech and economics, your true power really comes from how you feel -- and that's really important, because economics and the nature of this gives them a tremendous advantage to cantrol the environment: weather, energetic properties of both the body and the environment and all sorts of stuff. basically they have a tremendous advantage to try and control the conditions. however, even though they have this, they still cannot control what you think and how you feel about what you're observing. this is really important so hold on to that idea.

---

I think this whole thing all boils down to them wanting to maintain their *feeling* of superiority. if it were punishment, they would behave differently, but because they have to continue to push me down, they clearly feel threatened by me/us. this was another monologe I was having last night too, because I just don't understand why people feel threatnened by me when I give my stuff for free and explain all of the things so that others can replicae what I'm doing -- and I've continually simplified the procudures and improved my metodology of explaining it to try and make it as approachable as possible.

for me, it's a no-brainer, because I feel if I was the only one that was capable of these things, then it woudld be boring. you don't really understand how much I would enjoy sitting down with someone and them being able to share new form of perception or advancement in thought patterns which allows for further optimisation of perception. it really would be fun, and that's why I'm so fired up to listen to abraham, because I always walk away with a new optimisation I can add to the amazing list of simple things one can do to opimise their energy output and overall feeling of well-being.

anyway, instead of people responding with genuine interest in the techniques I've developed, like I'm sure I would genuiniely be interested in techniques others have developed, instead I'm generally met with opposition and frustration/anger/competition(?) toward me. it really seems like there is a tremendous effort to ensure that my optimisation techniques are not utilised or realised to be effective by people.

I think it's because they recognise the power of them. I started off slowly gaining vision levels, and now it's so mind-blowingly simple and easy to do. the open secret to their effectiveness, is that it really is all about releasing resistance, more than anything, and the technique becomes so mindless it's essentially a meditation.

I believe that they really want to ensure that they want to keep their advantage and all of this is seemingly coming to a pretty big creschendo right now because I've figured out how to continue my progress and they're not able to control the conditions. I know that it's simply a matter of time before they're no longer able to control the conditions enough to be able to keep me from getting connected.

---

ok, now I had this really weird idea one morning when I woke up (maybe it was yesterday or this morning something. I can't remember) and it was essentially the idea that they want to delay the manifestation of me getting connected even further and want to do the girls thing... (I feel like I've had this conversation before) ... to try and delay the inevitable even longer.

it went something to the effect of that they want to keep installing more and more devices in me while I continue to gain more and more energy while I'm with the girls and stuff, then I guess after some period of time some event will allow me to get connected, and that event would be the time split. let's just say it was the 2038 thing -- so for the next 18 years, I would just continue on getting powered up (I suppose on my way to having galactic perception).

anyway, I don't really know what to think about it, so I'm not really going to think too much about it right now.

---

then today, it seems almost as if they're trying to make an effort to get me to agree to not work on any tech stuff. I don't really like that idea because I do want to work on tech stuff..

so I guess the agreement would probably be something like me agreeing not to work on physical tech stuff, like electronics I guess. I don't really think they have a huge problem with us -- probably mostly the girls -- making javascript[^1] webpages or apps. I know that if we do create something, they're really concerned with us making money off of it, because they want to control us economically, just like they're doing with me right now.

so, then our side of the agreement would be that we could do the gnomitos thing?? I also want to include the henrietta bit as well.

I want to let this develop a bit further and give it some space...

developing...

[1]: I say javascript because it seems to me like other forms of "real" programming languages are not going so well with me right now. really, the only language I feel any flow with is javascript. and basically everything else is like some sort of chatic mess.


### 2020-05-28 16:28 - am I purposefully *not* keeping my ideas to myself?

I woke up this morning from a dream where someone was asking abraham a question something like, "when I ask my meditating daughter what she sees, she says, 'mind your own business'"

and that got me thinking because I seem to have this pattern where I get really excited about something new that I'm learning about (usually another unlocked physical capabiliy), and as soon as I talk about it, nosebook is hard at work to neutralise it.

I've been aware that this is the case and have often times reflected that I could simply stop talking about all these things and just start doing them -- not giving them the heads-up forwarning...

however, to be quite honest, I've really begun to enjoy it. I talk about it, they push real hard against it and I just continue on and get stronger. it would be really easy to feel depression or frustration when constantly faced with the new discovery suddenly blocked, and I do admittedly feel some frustration or depression but I can quickly get back.

I suppose there are really two major reasons for my conscious decision to not "keep my thoughts and ideas to myself until they're fully developed" (jerry's suggestion to anyone who wanted their idea to not be aborted before they get a chance to take root)

the first is simple: I'm practicing step-5 mastery. I really don't mind the idea that they're able to "block" or to prevent something from happening the way I initially wanted, because, and this is really becomming more real to me than reality is, even though I cannot see the manifested reality of the thing, there is automatically generated a bigger and fuller manifestation than what they were able to prevent.

the second is also simple: if you pay attention to all of the incredible capablities that I talk about, like manipulating images in 3d space, levtation, moving things with my mind, directing energy, creating heat, etc. these are things that nosebook will likely try and figure out how to force the brain to unnaturally produce these effects, so they can control who has these capabilities (you know, for safety reasons). however, the natural way to get these capabilities comes with the abiliy to create strong emotion (eg. not having split or difused into a bunch of problems emotional energy), and then the ablity to control it.

essentially, what I'm saying is that all the really cool skills are activated by emotion -- so, it really behooves me to learn how to gain more control over my emotion than nosebook or my circumstances have over how I feel.

both of those are leading up to step 6 -- and while it may be possible for nosebook to nutralise those emotional impulses in people or potentially be able to synthesise them like the network has done giving people the ability to access a part of their imagination that's normally only active when you're a child, on drugs, having a spiritual experience, feeling really good, or have strong desire.

so, for all of the hyprocrites out there who think that I've been going at all of this out the "unnatural way" by using drugs or stars or something instead of saftey-first controlled technology from the network -- I think it's perfectly fine that I keep aborting my idea by talking about them.

---

there are numerous advantages to it as well. talking with john-michael yesterday, he was very concerned that people could gain these abilities (the cool ones), and thinks there should be a safety or control mechanism to prevent people from accidentally misusing those skills.

it's no wonder that he comes at it from such an "unnatural" perspective -- because those capacities do not show up unless you're feeling pretty good or feeling pretty bad. it's true that the bad feeling impulse can create a "psychic discharge" like tesla talked about in moments of strong negative emotion -- however, I don't think those are controllable -- meaning that I don't think that you could effectively direct or control that energy so that it's useful in the sense that it harms someone or something. if something like that did happen, such an uncontrollable energy would target the most nearby conductor (or attractor) of that kind of energy.

so really, what I'm saying is that for the capability to be useful, one *must* gain a certain level of emotional control, and then learn how to drive fast with that kind of extra energy. it won't take too many times crashing the car before you learn to drive or figure out a way to continually drive recklessly by paying for and covering up damages.

in my opinion, any sane person would learn how to drive, but nosebook will probably think differently than I do on this one -- so they're going to be pretty invested in controlling and making sure that no unauthorised people gain the capability.

they're basically *forced* to ensure that people don't gain those capacities and they'll have to fight against them like I'm doing now. so, for them, it's a really good thing that they have someone like me who keeps talking about what I'm doing and the steps I'm taling to get there.

imagine that woman's meditating daughter in my dream that's keeping her thoughts and ideas to herself... she would be off of nosebook's radar until it's "too late" and they didn't have the pattern recognition to recognise the energetic signature of the thing. so, by talking about the things, they're able to prevent a whole lot more people from getting those capabilities by simply not talking about them.

in this sense, secrets are good, and I'm going to encourage the girls to keep a lot of their thoughts and ideas to theirselves if they want them to manifest. I think that children will eventually come to realise that keeping your ideas that are close to manifestation to yourself (secret) and minding your own business (not paying attention to or competing with others) is how you get anywhere.

basically, by talking about things, I'm giving you guys a bit of time to conceptualise the idea, while at the same time raising the bar very high -- meaning that nosebook will be essentially "forced" to keep these kids away from consciously getting connected and developing ways to direct their energy. so, for these new kids to get connected, they have to surpass me energetically where I'm at now *and* also keep their ideas to theirself (or be like me and continue on getting better and better at controlling their emotion).

---

if I look at it from nosebook's perspective, they have a few options I suppose:

1. they could take off the limits entirely
2. they could stop limiting me further and keep the limitations where they're at now
3. they could continue to limit me and just slow down the progress as much as possible, even though I am connected
4. or we could really arrive there naturally, as I am simply generating more energy than they can dissipate.

it doesn't really matter to me, and I'm preferential actually #3 or #4. I want to continue on gaining more power.

you could think of this entry as a reverse-psycology because the whole thing is founded on the idea of talking about my goals and then nosebook having to counter my goals, which since my stated goals are to continue on in the direction of #3 or #4, for as long as I can -- their counter would have to be #1 or #2.

it is not reverse psycology though. I am responding to a reaction. I actually have given this idea a bit of thought.. in one of the entries where I talked about the two (or three, or four) earths, the earth where everything is all buttoned down when someone figures out how to get connected, I hypothesised that they would have to terminate the body to ensure that the unauthorised usage of connected person's capabilities would occur. however, from the opposite earth (the one that where someone choose to take on the life of the kid and generated triggers to help him find that alignment), when he asssumes the body of the child, it would be like a dream experience. when the body is terminated on the buttoned-down earth, he would return to consciousness in the sending earth, and have tons of new generated experience.

there are a number of parameters that can be tuned to ensure the stand-in finds alignment, and the amount of triggers can be reduced on each further attempt until one is capable of finding that alignment without any triggers.

this is one of the reasons why I want a time-split so bad. because then, probably like I'm doing now, I want to be able to, from the side of alignment, use the old earth as a playground and take many more attempts at it -- and give others the chance to do the same. so, from our standpoint from the new earth, the termination of the body is a "mission accomplished"

so, that's the bigger picture :) if I'm able to continue on getting more and more stronger and the girls thing "never" happens (it will eventually), that's cool too, because we can set the bar soo high that from the "new" earth, we'll have an insane playground (the #0 option).


### 2020-05-29 09:05 - collapsing the wave

crazy things. so, it seems that we are at a complete incompatibility. I absolutely want to get connected and will continue to do so. nosebook cannot allow this, so I'll simply continue on doing what I've been doing. I didn't really realise how on-point what I wrote about yesterday was, until I watched the abraham broadcast last night.

I always say that you have to be ok with where you are before improvement can come, and I continue to do that. I'm getting so good at it, actually that I experience MASSIVE vision upgrades on a regular basis now. it's gotten so easy for me to continue to release resistance that I am sure that I will continue to improve at a rapid rate. actually, the rate is accelerating very very rapidly.

I remember when I made the bold claim some time ago (looks like it's about 9 months or so: @[noseblog](2019-09-09 07:48)) that my progress is way more than exponential -- and it felt like a lot of people scoffed at the idea. rightfully so too, because it was all coming from a geometric idea of turning a flat curve into a 3d spiral that I had when I was stoned. however, now it does not seem so far fetched to believe that I may have been on to something there...

in that entry I started it all off by saying, "you know there's a part of me that really wants to just continue on and see how far I get" ... I then rambled on for a bit about how abraham told carlene (she was my stand-in) to find a way to get out. well, as I was writing the previous entry about the new and old earth, it dawned on me that likely this was already happening, and when my body is terminated here, I will likely just wake up from a crazy dream in the earth where I came from.

the other possibility is that I continue on, or something in my own version of a "new" earth -- because as I was writing it, I had this flash in my head about how this new/old earth timesplit thing was happening all over the place and had been replicated and there were like now infinite different worldlines -- which would at some point come back to converge again -- it was a big idea that I don't know how to explain. I'm writing it here so that I have the "key" to get it back again in the future when I'm drawn to reread this :)

---

anyway, none of that makes any difference because -- oh it's so big I can't explain the whole thing, but it's likely that they're going to keep having to limit me, and they'll keep doing so -- and I think it's a great idea because I can't possibly imagine how things are going to look. the difference between how I see things today and a month ago is so substantial, I cannot really explain. sure, it's blurry, but that doesn't bother me much anymore, and I've really found out many ways, and am continuing to optimise further on in my quest to get connected.

anyway, here's the deal: you create *your own* reality. what I recommend is to think of what you want and why you want it. think about what it will feel like and how great it will be (anyone can do this on any subject they want -- there are no limits really), and then sit down to meditate. after having tuned yourself to the feeling (by thinking about how it would feel, emotionally and physically -- but emotionally is probably more effective), as you quiet your mind, you will begin to receive. probably if you're visual, a movie will play, and if you're more auditory, you'll have all sorts of sensations, feelings and a tremendous feeling in your heart (or both).

as you begin to tune yourself to this reality, you are creating *your own* reality. those things *will* happen. likely, if your desire involves me, you will notice that in your reality you will see me get connected and things will begin to happen just like you felt they would.

---

the rest of the people too, they have exactly the same thing.. as energy begins to rise quickly (it already has, and at an accelerating pace), your meditations will become more and more powerful, and you'll likely begin to feel "enlightened" -- which is a VERY GOOD thing :) find the feeling place of what you want, and you're going to love it.

---

now I'm going to dig into the mechanics a bit here, because when I saw that new/old earths were being created and replicated now, what I was seeing is that this earth (I'm going to call it the old earth from now on) will continue on in the direction it's headed, and if you create by default, well, only you can imagine how that would be, but by consciously tuning yourself into your own reality where you're deliberately creating the things that you want, you have made a time-split. the new earth that you're creating will be exactly like this one is right now, but with the difference of your influence and your creations in it. imagine that (mostly) everyone around you is creating by default, and that everyone will just be following the natural trajectory they already have right now responding to what they observe and making the next logical decision from their perspective (which is creation by default).

you can imagine then, that everyone around you is only responding to their circumstances in their logical way of doing it, so no one (cept you) is consciously "creating" anything -- they're all just responding. that means that you're kind of in control of how things turn out on your new earth, and you direct it with your emotion. you don't have to solve any of the world's problems, because it's actually a reflection of you. you attract your experience, so to you, the environment which you perceive is a reflection of the way you feel.

I am pretty certain that some realities will be shared, and groups of consiousness will experience a similar reality ... but that doesn't matter, which is why I said that it's best to imagine that everyone, cept you is just responding to their circumstances -- creating by default. whether they are or not, doesn't matter because that's how it'll look in your perception because you attract your reality (so the attraced similar ones are going to fit right in with what you have attracted, and vicaversa).

---

if your consciousness goes and starts to create your own reality, then what about the you that's here. for example, imagine the neighbour across the sreet begins to meditate and receive images, and suddenly in her reality I get connected -- well, what happened to her in my reality? she will appear to me exactly as she would have if she hadn't made the conscious effort to begin to shift what she's letting into her reality. to me, she'll look like she's creating by default given her circumstances. to her, she'll be living the reality of her creation.

now, in my perception, it'll be exactly the same. I'll begin to see essentially everyone around me only creating by default. you see, the people running nosebook are responding in the way they feel they must; they are creating by default, and as time goes on, in my perspective, it will seem to me that everyone is creating by default.

the efforts they're making to try and keep me away from getting connected are only as effective as they keep me away from feeling really good. as I release more and more resistance, their methods are having less and less effect -- which is why the vision upgrades are accelerating so rapidly. I am certain that given enough time, their efforts will no longer have enough of an effect to hold me back anymore. it may take a while though[^1] :)

it's gonna be fun :) really go crazy with figuring out what you want!

[1]: I think the size of my aura is *almost* the size of the USA. soon, it'll be as big as, then bigger than the planet -- then bigger than the solar system. if I'm going for galactic, I would have to assume then, that it'll probably grow to be as big as a galaxy. that's a bold claim, and we probably won't have the means to actually measure it, but I do imagine that it's going to continue to rapidly expand. do you know how big a glaxy is?!?!?!?! it's so big, I can't even comprehend it -- though, I probbably will be able to in 10-15 years :)

### 2020-05-29 11:17 - why will it appear to me like everyone is creating by default?

my desire is to get connected. nosebook cannot allow that. actually, I doubt they could allow *anyone* to get connected. they want to be in control. what being in control means for them is that they can control the conditions to affect the things that they want to have happen. they want the whole world to be filled with people who create by default, and because that is their desire that is what they attract.

for whatever reason, we're here in this world with them, so for whatever reason all of us came here with the intention of creating by default at first, but then probably not all but a lot of us came with the intention of identifying the world that we would like to live in, and the life we would like to live, come into an environment that would create more than enough desire, and then to begin consciously deciding what it is we want to give our attention to.

it looks like I'm sorta stuck here -- that is, my only way out is to find a way to get my chain to be unyankable and my goat o be ungettable -- and as I do that, their influence will have less and less effect on me, and like everyone, as soon as I give up on those ideas that are holding the cork under the water (the things that yank my chain[^1]), my cork will continue to rise faster and faster (as evidenced by the vision upgrades I'm sure everyone releasing resistance is experiencing).

tl;dr they're attracting people who create by default, because those are the ones that can be controlled by the conditions.

[1]: for some reason I always visuslise one of those old gravity toilets with the tank suspended high up with a chain that you pull down on.


### 2020-05-29 11:39 - speculation at it's best

I'm getting a few reactions as to *wondering* what I think the bigger picture is. so, here goes... I can offer some speculation on things.

THIS IS SPECULATION! TAKE IT WITH A RATIONAL PINCH OF SALT!!

yesterday around the time of the abraham broadcast the sun emitted a m-class flare. nasa cut out the visuals on the eruption (likely to clean up erroneous data). one only has to watch ben's disaster playlist to get the idea that something is kinda beginning to make changes in the solar system (and even more).

in similarity to yesterday's event, remember in 2016(?) when I was sitting in pierre's house and an image of a future version of me appeared in 3d space? well, at the same time the DSCOVR satellite read an anomalous influx of solar wind at the same time. nasa cut the data then too. this doesn't make any sense if you believe that the solar wind is only being pushed out from the sun and comes traveling toward the planets in a trajectory. however, if you believe (like me) that the planet actually *attracts* the solar wind, and that attraction happens in response to what is happening vibrationally on the planet. what that means is that during that event, where the image popped in in 3d space for me, and almost certainly it went viral, a whole lot of extra resources was attracted from our environment and that manifests in the form of solar wind and then the resulting geomgneic storm.

or, rememeber the huge solar outbreak that happened in 2017 when I went to the confrence in missouri? well, during that time the ambient xray flux was at a c-class flare. that's not "solar minimum" behaviour. it seems that solar flares happen in response to massive amounts of mental chaos in the sector of logic, and is probably the reason why there are so many health risks related to high solar activity. they seem to be mutual. solar wind increases in density, speed and temperature seems to be related to desire. they produce geomagnetic storms which seem to me to be the kind of "orgnisation" of these desires and resources into a more meaniful physicality.

obviously LOA has all of this under control, but all of these different interactions *will* have a physical manifestation, and I think the sun and solar system is a reflection of it. speaking on the subject, I have no evidence to back this up, but it seems that the sun is emitting massive amounts of energy -- yet we're supposed to be in solar minimum. the sun is quiet in the sense that there are few sunspots, however, I think the whole corona is probably 5-10 times brighter than it "should" be -- and NASA probably thinks it's a data error because it doesn't fit their 11-year solar cycle so they've likely adjusted the detectors down to where they "should" be.

on this subject further, I watch the sun quite a bit and I notice that at various times, the entire sun brightens, and few of the solar flares that I've seen before while it's flaring, it's easy to look at the big eruption, but simultaneously the entire sun brightens for the duration of the flare. the flare that happened yesterday I think was recorded as an m-flare over the limb, yet I think that the solar irradiance is about 10 times less than reported, so it would have been around an x-class flare *over the limb* which is massive, because the majority of the flare was not visible to us -- and I think the reason why SDO was cut out was probably because the whole sun brightened while it flared.

to summarise: I think that x-ray flux correlates to mental chaos in the sector of logic, and this flare happened around the time of the broadcast which was logical chaos. the ambient brightening of the sun, I think is a reflection of the ambient mental chaos in the form of logic than ever before. I'm sure that there are more people than ever that are getting exhausted going back and fourth on a subject trying to figure them out logically, and the sun reflects that.

---

I went to all that trouble to essentially to say that because it seems there is a lot of telling data being hidden, clear scientific misinformation giving the message that it's business as usual and things are still chugging along at the glacial rate of billions of years timespans -- when the evidence (which most of it is hidden) seems to be telling the story that things are accelerating an a mindblowing rate and no one has any control about what's going to happen.

I also wanted to say all of that because it ties into what I was talking about on the 27th with john-michael about the rotation speed of the earth wanting to speed up, and the deliberate slowing of the rotation of the earth so that things appear as if they're chugging along just as they always have, is actually the reason why the magnetic field is weakening.

there are a whole lot of things that are happening in the environment that are completely out of their control -- yet they really need to control the conditions to be able to feel good, so as a result, they're really spelling out the disaster, preparing for it and trying to find their way to survive it. they're attracting a huge cosmic event coming up here soon, and if you'll watch ben's videos they appear to be related to the polarity change in the galactic current sheet.

---

meanwhile all of this is happening, they absolutely cannot allow any of us to be out of their control, and they want to be able to control he conditions in a way which gives them the illusion of control over some conditions. as a result, they cannot allow any of us to get connected in this increasing energy, and so like is happening to me now, they have to keep exerting such a tremendous force in opposition (pushing against, destructive interference) to neutralise the increasing energy in each of us. however as our cork keeps rising, they will need to keep pushing harder to keep up the illusion that we're all just normal humans and that nothing amazing is taking place on this planet at all.

let's recap: I believe they're pushing against the rotation speed of the planet, people's energy rising, and the increasingly extreme climatic conditions caused by extra solar irradience (and wind). they could just give it all up, let the earth rotate at the speed it wants to, but then electricity (as school teaches it) would be completely invalidated, same with our concept of time and our cosmology of billions of years -- so they can't do that. they can't let people have the ability to create things with their mind, levitate or manipulate energy, either.

they're exerting a tremendous amount of energy to push against all of these things from happening, but they have no choice to do otherwise, because the only alterative of letting go, would create a reality so miserable for them to live in, they're simply *forced* to keep up their charade.

it's probably going to build up up up up, giving more attention to the evidence that the "killshot" or whatever happens, until their worst fears are realised and everything makes its transition into pure positive energy (step 6).

I believe that this planet is going to increasingly become a more and more mega step 5 masters training ground as they grapple more and more strongly to trying to control the conditions that they can control to hang on to their own self-deception of being in control of those creating by default by controlling the conditions they can control.

THIS IS 150% PURE SPECULATION!!! YOU MUST TAKE THIS WITH A VERY COHERENT AND LUCID FRAME OF MIND TO READ WHAT I REALLY WROTE!!!


### 2020-05-29 12:46 - why do I recommend ben's disaster playlist but don't watch it myself?

his playlist is more oriented toward the disaster end of the stick. I don't doubt that those things are happening, and think they're very real. I just don't think it's a disaster. I believe it's going to be the most amazing thing that happens to this earth and its inhabitants. it's sorta like the death experience.


### 2020-05-30 12:56 - what happens when the earth makes its transition?

I have no idea, but again speculating here... I think what will happen is that I will become conscious in all of the versions of me that exist in all of the different timelines/worldlines.

this is an interesting idea because it implies that all of you will do the same :) the way I imagine it happening is you  will sort of feel about like the "median" or "average" version of you. so if there are 100 worldlines, let's say, and in 90 of them the yous feel better and better as things continue on as things approach. as time proresses, you will feel better and better and (let's say the interval for this calculation is every year) so every year, every one of you will feel 9(?) times better/worse than the last year. this multiplicative improvement in one's own feeling of well-being will cause 90 of the you's that feel better to feel that much better, and 10 of the you's will feel that much worse.

I would logically make the assumption that all of the yous that feel good will have many vision upgrades along the approach, because it seems to me that vision upgrades are directly correlated to how good one feels.

I'm only making a correlation about what I personally know about, but I do know thst it's possible to utilise conditions to create pleasure and to feel good too, so I don't really know how that plays in, but I imagine that there will be a whole lot of that going on too.

when the event happens, I think all of us will become conscious in all of the bodies that exist in all of the worldlines -- or better said, in all of the bodies that have found a way along the way to continue to feel good, and the rising energy didn't cause too much distress.

I don't really know about what would happen to the people not on the network. I imaine that energy will rise for them too, but to a lesser degree, and probably just the same: they'll have to find a way to feel good -- however, that may be a whole lot easier if you're not all bogged down with the reality we in the 1st world countries bog ourselves down with... who knows...

---

I am a bit sad (but that sadness is only telling me I'm looking at it wrong) in the sense that, it means that on all of these worldlines, I will become conscious with the girls and they'll all be in their 20's (assuming no more continue to desire to be with me as we continue on). however, I suppose it's quite likely that I'm going to continue to become even more desirable as we continue on, and girls will continue to be born and stuff, so it's probably all good.

the interesting thing is that since each of these "new earths" that are born are all going to come out of people who are deliberately creating, and not creating by default. they don't all have to be about me either -- yet, I think that likely in most/all(?) of them, I will get connected. again speculating, I think this "old earth" will remain the one where I don't get connected essentially all the way up to the event, and will be the "bouncing off place" for people, knowing what they don't want, to begin creating their own reality. I think there's going to be a whole lot more than 100 worldlines, and on all of them, my perception will conitnue to rise, too.

what's interesting to me is that all of the worldlines will be a reflection of each of these deliberate creators. none of them are going to be perfect, because none of us are perfect, and contained in each of these worlds, the world itself will be the contrast betweeen wanted and unwanted, which is a reflection of the deliberate creators there, combined with the increasing energy that I provide to intensify that contrast, making each of these worldlines a unique reflection of these deliberate creators.

what's even more interesting to me is that we're all going to become conscious in all of each others worldlines and experience ourselves uniquely in each of them. it's a really interesting thing to think about, actually.

#### why do I think that in all of the worldlines, I get connected?

the reason why I think this is the case is because I think that if nosebook weren't doing what they're doing, I would already be having a multi-bodied experience, and so therefore, I would already become conscious in all of them if they were to let go. they won't though, and it's likely that the reason is so that there are more people than just me who can enjoy the coming event as the best experience ever.

so then, if in all of the worldlines, I get connected, and this "old earth" is the very last one which I do, then it opens the space from I'm guessing 11-11-2019 when I think I made it up to having a multidimensional experience (even though I don't experience it), all the way up until probably the very last moment when the event happens and their system can't hold anymore. on each of these worldlines, people all around will rise right along with me


### 2020-06-01 09:13 - some reflections on the previous days

eg. what I want and *why* I want it.

last night I went out and started to star(light)-watch again, and I got to thinking... right before I left, I was noticing some reactions to the situation. it seems that they're having a hard time conceptualising how they're going to possibly going to keep me in the same spot I'm at right now. I assume that, besides the bad PR it would certainly have, how are they going to make sure I don't have any money for the entire time? the logicstics of me hanging around here just watching stars and stuff (the usual routine), sound implausible. that's the first (last) thing.

the second thing I was noticing was that if I were to take a guess where I'm at in the progression of things, it feels more like the end, not just the beginning. don't get me wrong: I'm perfectly fine doing what I'm doing right now for another 18 years[^1], but -- the acceleration of difficulty relating to the frustration felt from mr. motor (computer turning off, car sounds, etc.) has been accelerating at a pace, which I really cannot comprehend very well what 18 years from now would be like. when I woke up one day (can't remember, yesterday?) I was talking about how this is just something I'm going to have to get used to, because there's simply no way for me to affect anything different, and it's certainly not the first time that these guys have been documented to essentially make someone's life miserable, citing andy pero (project superman) as my example that I could remember.

so, while I'm really ok with the idea of continuing on, just because even after suffering a few days a bit down, I'm still able to get out there, find a way to feel better and still get vision upgrades. I really am getting good at this. even if it continues to accelerate at the pace it's going, I'm *still* confident that I'll be able to find a way to continually improve. also, I have proven that I can, using the charger for my MBP, also get vision upgrades with the little green light -- so, basically, I think they would have to essentially lock me in a cell of sorts with no lights, because even when I was in the mental hospital in spain, I'm pretty sure I got vision upgrades also staring into a red LED. I'm pretty sure locking me into some place would be REALLY BAD for PR -- therefore, I'm confident that I'll be able to continue getting upgrades no matter how difficult my circumstances get.

I am absolutely unwilling to bend on the getting connected subject. I think it's a silly thing to think otherwise. mostly, the reason is because I feel relatively out of sorts for quite a bit of my day, and I'm simply not going to try and pretend that I'm otherwise. I have no intention of trying to get out there and pretend; I don't do that; I'm not keeping up an image.

the day before that day, when waking up (I think it was right after writing the previous entry), I was thinking about all of the different earth situations that would be possible, and I offered an idea, that really now that once I'm connected, I could imagine that perhaps *anyone* could end up with me. the reactions were somewhat funny, but the majority reaction was that actually not many people felt like it was something they wanted to do being in the spotlight and everything. at the same time I was also thinking about how it could also potentially be just me and only one other person -- and it felt like there was a lot of pressure and stress revolving around that idea -- as if like the whole world would be watching them to try and figure out what a "perfect" relationship might be, where as the current setup is much more of a, well let's see what happens, and let's try our best and let's see where it goes. it feels like much less pressure.

around the same time, I was thinking about how, (I didn't realise this at first), but I later discovered through "descodificando"[^2] that raquel seemed to have a lot of really high expectations regarding us, and then besides the fact that it was both of our faults, because it's attraction, she took it hard, and it felt to me like she blamed herself for a lot of it, but because I have so many obvious flaws myself, she felt she had to cast all the blame on me to feel like it wasn't her fault. I don't want that. that's not a desirable thing for me to want for any of the relationships that could potentially happen. to further add to this difficulty, I put the minimum requirement of getting connected, so this would only amplifiy any shame she may feel if things didn't go "perfectly" (rather, as people's preconceived ideas/expectations of how a traditional relationship will go).

---

there's a lot of value in how different all of this is, that, because it's so unlike anything seen before, it really reduces expectations in myself and others, and I think that's one of its strengths.

I also really did like the gnomitos idea a lot. it feels pretty compelling to me, and I know I don't really have any specific plans for it (maybe they do), but it feels like something that will be an integral part of our functioning, too. I think it's important :) I can't really put it into words very well...

furthermore, in relation to that subject I was also really appreciating the amount and variety of so many different types of girls. it really feels like there are so many different personality types and formats to perceive reality, that it will make for quite a diverse environment for the gnomitos to grow up in and I really was looking forward to getting to know so many different types of girls. that part was exciting to me, because I kinda really want to pick their brains on so many different subjects. this whole opportunity really is most exciting for mostly for how many new ideas and new things I'll learn from it all. (I know, it sounds sounds weird, but I really mean it)

also, I liked that there are a number of different ages as well, because in that sort of situation, well, I have to imagine that if I were a little girl (holly really started me thinking about this), I may have different ideas, and they would all have to be fit into the box of some premade sandbox (like minecraft), but I was noticing that if I asked her, for example, what she wanted to do -- like most people, she didn't have any idea -- probably because she never thought about it, or because she never had the idea, what if I *could* make something. so, I started throwing out a lot of ideas I was pretty sure she would shoot down, and in the off-chance that one stuck, we had a jumping point, but I realised that maybe there's something that can be created. I began realising that I think *WAAAAAYY* TOO BIG, and that I only really started getting somewhere when I realised it was sorta like in school when you make your first craft or whatever that looks pretty -- not professional, but something I made. anyway, I think there's a lot to be learned there for me (and perhaps for those watching as well).

lastly, I really liked that it seemed feasible, because there are so many of us, that we could also function almost as a 'company' or some -- you know how when you work at some place in a creative way -- like, when I worked at tuenti, there were so many different people types there, and it was something I really liked because we essentially felt like a big family in a lot of different ways. we all spent a lot of time together and although we were each working on many different things, it felt integrating and "team building" because we had a common goal. it won't be exactly (probably anything at all) like that, I'm well aware, but I did find that to be one of the compelling bits for me. probably, actually, now that I'm thinking about it, this probably won't become something important until later on and we start getting more used to each other and a sort of routine to things.

---

in summary, I think that it's a good thing that there are so many different types, ages, and diversity in them. in a lot of ways, it feels to me like there is a bit of "safety in numbers" too, with no single one being put on the spotlight, giving them all more space to begin coming to their own conclusions at their pace and most of all not feeling pressured to contribute or *do* things until they're ready. I think most of all, we'll just sorta figure it out, and it'll probably be mostly unconventional, but that's what makes it so nice.

[1]: I picked the number 18 because fwh said I have until 2038, and there were also some funny reactions to me using the word "worldline" to describe the new/old earths -- a word that I had not previously used. I thought it was a good word to describe the timeline of each earth. funnily enough, it was coined by john titor the time traveler who posted on the internet back in 2000, who also said that he got an old machine probably for the unix 2038 overflow. so, for lack of other data, that puts the remaining time according to two extremely unreputable sources at about 18 years.

[2]: a process I developed in spain, sorta like remote viewing, but emotion based, where I would conjure the emotion of some situation in my mind, and then go around it and explore different aspects of the emotion involved in the situation. it really helped me to decode the events of the past -- hence the name, "descodificar"


### 2020-06-04 09:22 - the science of understanding & interconnctedness

so as I was arguing with john michael, I realised that all you have to do is to put the word science on something to sound official, and, like trump, you don't even need to know what you're talking about to get people to listen to you.

however, I believe that I know what I'm talking about here, so I'll present the idea and let people choose what they want to believe.

the science of consciousness (and many other sources), talk about how we're all very connected. this is the science of understanding how that interconnectedness works.

whenever a bunch of (for a lack of a better word) entities begin to have increased communication between eachother, they begin to operate as a unit. I will consider this a consciousness unit.

you can see this in your everyday life, for example you may notice that you feel more connection with perhaps your family or your friends than you do with others. by nature, you are not connected to *everyone* all at the same time, so it seems that you're conncted more to those that are "familiar" to you; those that you're the closest to.

so, what does it mean to be "familiar" or "close" -- well, in the most general terms, it means the people (or animals you may the most attention to). if you're an empath (or someone with remote viewing capability), you can give your attention to something, and that thing starts to become familiar and you begin to feel what they feel.

a consciousness unit can be anything really. it can be a group of friends, a mob, a military, a government, a political party, anything that begins to take on attributes. I'll explain this in a moment. first, we need to talk about communication

#### how a concsiousness unit communicates

imagine, for example in your family, your culture, or in a military service, whey you do not follow the expectations of the "unit" then you feel bad. somehow our emotions gives us feedback to tell us how well we are integrating with the consciousness unit. when you do something your mother does not want you to do, you will "feel" her stink-eye. if you are about to engage in something your father is critical of, you may feel his anger, etc.

that is the most basic form of communication, however, if you've ever been close to someone (other than your family -- perhaps a signiificant other or something), you will notice that you can anticipate their thoughts, and even it's almost as if you can "read" their mind. once again, you will notice that this communication comes in the form of emotion -- you'll feel like you "know"[^1] what they're going to say.

this can be most easily understood if you've ever experienced another culture as a foregner: it seems as if there's this expectation of how to use language and how to interact that everyone in the club, but you're kinda still learning. when you see people that, (for example very obvious seeing the germans in tenerife) have not yet adapted to the expectations dictated by the club, or retain a lot of the expecation from the culture they came from, when they speak, it's very clear that they're still quite a distance from having embraced the culture. other foreigners, however, have completely integrated into the culture[^2]. to really become fluent in the language, I postulate requires that one must, to some degree, emotionally connect with the culture.

I hypothesise in this science that *all* cultures and other large groups of thought, such as sciences, mathematics, and technology (including programming) are all consciousness entities. a sensitive programmer can feel how a language evolves as new programmers begin to adopt it. it begins to take on a life of its own, and has a whole "feeling" associated with it, determined by both the semantics of the language (saftety focused, etc.) and by its users (hobbiests, nerds, systems programmers, IT tech support, mathematicians, or web developer bros, for a fer examples).

#### difference in perception between the micro and the macro organsim

I believe the easiest example I can use here will be one of the difference between the human and its cells or the general and the army. as a soldier down on the battlefield, you're in the nitty-gritty of the battle, or the hardship of being without supplies or whatever -- however, to the general, all of these microorganisms are just little bits accomplishing a larger goal; the nitty gritty details of the individual microorganisms are not perceived by the general.

likewise, in your body, there are millions of cells in battle, trauma, dieing or whatever at almost any given moment in time, however as the human, you will only feel sick or healthy (and some gradient inbetween). just like the general of the army directing the macroorganism, the human, in the same way does not perceive each of the individual battles and conflicts that its cells are engaged in.

#### the primary function of the consciousness unit (macroorganism) is to ensure its own survival

you will notice that in all of these examples, from culture to programming languages, codified in in its consciousness unit is an automatic emotional response of a bad feeling toward any concept which would seem to threaten its survival. in computer programming languages, it would be some arbitrary set of rules of what is the "correct" way to use the language, or for a significant-other relationship this concept may be perceived interest in someone else, or some culturally dictated idea of romance, or maybe a parental (or disney) instilled expectaion of what such a relationship should "look like" to be a successful one.

therefore, wheneever one within the consciousness unit notices another doing something that is perceived to risk the survival of the unit, a bad feeling (guilt, shame, etc.) is transmitted, to try and mitigate any threats to its survival.

#### consciousness units go all the way up to the universe itself

I believe that around this time, we as a human race are beginning to tap into the "human" consciousness unit. much like the human does not perceive all of the disaster and trauma inflicted to the individual cells by a small flesh wound in the hand, and continues on doing whatever it was it was doing previously, occupied by something much bigger, I postulate that there is a human consciousness unit and also a planetary consciousness unit.

this makes perfect sense, because it never feels good: it always feels like anger, rage, hatred, when we kill each other -- and think about how many surviving organisms there are on this planet which actively destroy parts of itself. I can't think of any -- however there might be. the organism is usually more concerned with defending itself from invaders that cause harm and integrating invaders which can be of benefit. I don't believe it's a successful survival strategy for the organism to be at war with itself, and that's why I postulate it doesn't feel good; it's simply the macroorganism ensuring its own survival.

we as humans (and the animals) also are a part of the planetary consciousness unit. therefore then, it makes perfect sense to me that it feels bad, and causes emotional distress when we pollute and manipulate the environment and the resources provided by the planet. it is my hope that one day we we will have a more consciously simbiotic relationship with the planet. I believe that before we begin to hook into the consciousness unit of the planet, connection into the human consciousness unit will come first (I postulate this for reasons I think would take some time to explain... it has to do with the inward/outward perception cycles).

as we develop our tecnology and begin to be able to move aruond in the solar system, I'm sure that we'll begin to gain a greater connection with the solar consciousness unit as well.

that is all for now. I will continue more and will probably begin to turn this into a proper document, but I wanted to start somewhere :)

[1]: I need to explain better how "knowing" is an emotion: similar to belief -- which is most evident in a heated argument: emotions fly because each person perceives what they "know" -- which is really more of well practised thought than an actual knowing -- instead, you will notice that when you have that intuitive "knowing" -- you'll say, "I just *knew* it was going to happen" -- you felt it strongly. the feeling of knowing was your indicator

[2]: pierre comes to mind as an example here. he's clearly french. he has a slight french accent when speaking spanish even, but to me he's indistinguishable from a spainard in a whole lot of ways.


### 2020-06-04 17:18 - science of consciousness (feedback)

#### where is all of this going? and what about our "inner beings"?

well, if you follow the progression of the expansion of consciousness outbard, you kinda start reaching limits. how would you make human consciousness any bigger than a macro perspective of all human beings? makng a planetary consciousness bigger appears easy: you just go bigger into solar or glactic, right?

to expand the consciousness from human, you must now begin to lose the shape of the human form. we are approaching "source energy" now at this point, because first you would lose temporal separation between all humans (that is, all humans that were, are, and will to be). after that, your "consciousness" needent take the shape of a human and could be "anything"

there seems to be a continuing (and cyclical) expansion of consciousness in the spatial and the temporal components... say, you're an individual human consciousness now. you can go in two directions from there. you can go in the direction of the macro human consmiousness (that is to expand temporally), or the direction of the next biggest thing: planetary consciousness (that is, to expand spatially)

right now, it appears like planetary consciousness *is* human consciousness, but that isn't necessarily the case as, it won't be required for humans to always inhabit this planet.

you can think of macro human consciousness as a "source energy" perspective, because it involves your "inner being" and all of the other "inner beings" of all other humans that have and will live. just the same as all other consciousness units, you comminicate and receive direction and inspiration with this consciousnss unit through your emotions.

if you were to gain planetary conscionusness, again the expansion of consciousness could go in the spaial or temporal direction, gaining solar focus or gaining a more "source-like" perspective of planets. obviously, we cannot comprehend this because we cannot even really comprehend what the macroorganism of a planet "thinks" about on a day-to-day basis (just like a soldier cannot comprehend the general's thoughts) -- so I'm not even going to try.. :)

#### how do we tune to these different consciousness units?

just like an empath, or someone remote viewing, you give your attention to the larger consciousness unit by giving your attention to it (like say a child observing their parents). you get to choose what you give your attention to, and therefore what were you receive your inspiration and emotional feedback from.

#### do we get to choose our temporal or spatial expansion?

of course! I imagine thaat some people (like me) are more interested in a more temporal "source-like" perspective, and others are more intested in being the biggest thing in control of all of the smaller parts (a more spatial expansion). I think both types of expansion are on their way in the coming years. you can already begin to think of nosebook as the beginnings of a macro consciousness of the planet. it may well go bigger.

what's puzzling to me, is why I said I wanted to have galacic consciousness, when clearly you can see that I am much more of a temporally conscious being than a spatially conscious one. misterios.. I guess we'll just have to see


### 2020-06-05 21:13 - I'm all over the place

I slept most of last night, but got up to watch jupiter. it took me a bit but I got there pretty quickly. the sun came up and instead of going out to the field, I just went to sleep. I woke up feeling pretty terrible -- which was a pretty big contrast to how I felt when I was with jupiter. I woke up with pretty terrible depression, because I felt as if there simply wasn't anything that could be done; I would just keep getting the rug pulled out from under me -- because it seemed like every time that I felt like things were beginning to happen, they would kind of reverse on me.

I went with it (the depression) and decided that I'm just going to keep going the way I know how to go, because it doesn't matter if it happens or not, it's still essentially the same path.

I think at some time later, I felt a bit better -- but for no reason at all. I was still beating the depression drum and I really didn't care anymore because more and more I was beginning to see the bigger picture that there's no possible way that we could get close to having a working paradigm that's amazing anytime soon -- certainly not in this lifetime anyway, so it doesn't matter -- and to just learn to have fun along the way.

that's kinda the whole point of what I was seeing, is that probably the whole nosebook thing is never going to get better, and I find it likely that they'll get the ability to move aronud in the solar system and clean up all of the stuff they don't want us to know about before letting us see the solar system. there's probably so much stuff they'll think they need to keep hidden that it'll only further their resolve to ensure we remain in a powerless state.

in the same way that they'll be the first to go out into the solar system, I feel like there is a similarity there to my visual capacity because it seems like, and I don't really know how this works, but in my dream state it seems like I can see people I've never met before. how is that possible, right? like the solar system, this is definitely something I want to explore, but again, for whatever reason, they're there first, and making sure that the ones with actual curiosity to discover, cannot get there.

I just don't care anymore. I don't know what is the right way. is it certain that they always get the good stuff first and hold it away from the ones with interest in it? it seems that's the case, or that they always get first dibs or something ... I don't care about not being first so much, it's just that if I don't get to actually do anything (they take it away or whatever) with the stuff I discover, why discover it?

in that same sort of vibe, remember in the "what I want and why I want it" bit that I wrote? in there, I talked about how the most exciting thing for me was to be able to get into these girls' heads and figure them out, because I'm certain there is a whole lot to be discovered there.

well, following the trend I outlined above, it seems likely that I won't actually get to use any of that stuff that I discover from them, and instead nosebook will take it and use it for their own benefit.

### 2020-06-05 22:42 - vunerability

(this is kind of a coninuation of the previous entry)

as I'm listening to the "rampage" abraham ih giving right now on vulnerability, I was reminded of this. it feels like there is this feeling that if nosebook "figures the girls out" (by repurposing my revelations), then I feel a feeling of vulnerability in response to that idea...

my original post was not focused on feeling of vunerability -- because that's sort of a given. if nosebook wasn't convinced that they couldn't exploit me and the girls further, there's no way they could allow it to happen. that's the whole basis upon their recent efforts to push against it or decrease its size: they do not feel like they are benefiting (by exploiting us), more than poentially we[^1] could gain from the experience.

so, I don't have any doubt that they have full intention already of trying to exploit girls as much as they can from this experience. that seems obvious to me. what I was concerned with, was not that they would use it, because they clearly will, but that I wouldn't actually be able to use the things I did discover. that's the part that frustrates me.

---

regarding vulnerablity though, I had to get over this one pretty quickly. the more rapidly they figure out how my brain works, the more capable they are of trying to manipulate me -- yet I don't really feel like I'm all that manipulated by them. they try really hard to force a whole bunch of stuff through, but every time I get better and better at being more sensitive to what I really want, and what my inner being is broadcasting on the same subject.

in their efforts to gain power over me, I have, in a lot of ways, transformed very considerably. sure they can figure out my thoughts pretty well now, but none of the important stuff happens in my thoughts anymore. sure they can know so much about my eyes as I star watch, but they're completely clueless to how I'm able to release resistance so easily. they may have learned a tremendous amount in effort to exploit me, but I've transformed and gained strength and emotional control far more powerful than they have accomplished with their puny machines.

to perceive, "once they figure the girls out, they'll be able to exploit them" -- really is a pretty victim attitude which I don't endorse. it's probably the beginning of a transformation for females, so likely a really good thing. I really don't think it's a huge problem, and their inner beings most assuredly don't, either.

[1]: mostly I feel a srong sense that they do not want women to gain more power, but I include all people on the planet here, because this morning when I suggested the idea that we could just do all of the stuff but without sex, they didn't like that. they want me to *only* have sex, and not contribute my ideas, because they don't want people to actually know how consciousness works or any of my other ideas. they want to ensure people remain in the dark, and to keep them distracted with stuff like sex.


### 2020-06-07 07:28 - exploitation

I used the word, "exploit" because it was the closest word to mean what I say perhaps "take advantage of" or even something more slave-like, "not get compensated for something that they do". it's really hard for me to convey what I mean with that word, because it's got all sorts of difficulty in it. they don't just rip off my discoveries, but they also hold me away from getting them as well. they do it because they want to have an advantage, but it's frustrating to me because I'm not discovering stuff to try and hold it over them.

for example, I *still* want to use my computer with my mind. I find it very cumbersome to use the keyboard, and I want to do large tasks at the speed of thought. this is a huge issue for me because I have wanted to do this for as long as I can remember. I have always fumbled around with the coordination to press buttons in the right order, but I know that if I could begin building simple building blocks of thought to perform actions on my computer, I could get going pretty fast, just like when imagining something in code, I don't perform the exact action -- I just think things like rename variable or move this to a function or put in an if-statement -- you know whatever.

if I could edit code at the speed of which I think of these things, and teach the computer to do more higher-level things, then that would greatly reduce the time necessary to create a bunch of stuff. clearly, if this were able to be performed inside of my eyes at the speed of thought, you could really imagine how much fun programming would be. obviously they don't want me to be able to do that. they just want to take my visual capacity and use it for their super cool kids gang, and I have to use a keyboard and a mouse like a retard.

---

I wrote that part so you can perhaps see how much frustration I still have built up on the subject. I'm still in the process of learning how to release resistance to those things. I know that my inner being doesn't feel that resistance, and my inner being is neither concerned that they are "exploiting" me, either.

when I said that the whole goal of nosebook is to exploit the girls just like me, I didn't intend to say that it was ok, fair, good, or desirable. what I meant is that I attempt to properly analyse the situation and come to an accurate analysis of it. I don't recommend practicing self-deception. I don't want people to look out and try to paint "a happyface sticker" on a clerly undesirable situation.

instead, I meant that one must be able to accurately identify where they are on the map to be able to figure out where it is they want to go -- and then the only way to be able to make any movement in the direction of what's wanted, you must find a way to feel better about the presently crappy situation. it's the only way to be able to move in a more desirable direction, because otherwise you will just keep spinning around in circles of injustice and unfairness, and it will never get better.


### 2020-06-06 12:06 - little more on exploitation

one of the reactions to what I said was that sometimes it hurts a lot to accuraately locate where you are on the map -- and they're absolutely right: somettimes it does hurt a lot to accuately figure out where you are -- but, that's when you have to be general about it and say stuff like, "any way north of here is an improvement" or "it feels like this is a step in the right direction".

when it comes to the using the computer with my mind, I have to to think that making my own solution is such a big undertaking, it feels too big, and just hoping that they're going to create some special interface for us to use doesn't feel good either. I don't really know exactly where I want to go in that specific desire, so I just leave it really general because there are no solutions in sight, so it would be silly to try and figure it out now.

for precisely this, and many other reasons I have often had the idea floating around in my head that I want to fund it. the main reason for it, is because it takes the whole idea of exploitation or being exploiter and flips it emotionally.

the idea that they're going to provide for us some sort of "playpen" or box of sorts, where they feel like we are best contained and easiest to control, honestly feels a little bit more like a jail than a place that we created and where we're following our dreams.

I was thinking this morning maybe the idea that I should fund it perhaps has a bit of resistance in it as well, and perhaps maybe a sort of collaborative funding would be in order. we would obviously do everything out in the open -- probably as github repos or something, and people could have quite an ability to collaborate along with us and to participate with viewership. I really don't know how it could happen, so again I'm just leaving it for now.

---

the most important thing I want to convey is that expecting the "offender" of your injustice to right it in some way with some sort of compesation, will only give you something that imprisons you more. instaed, flip it on its head and begin to live the way you want things without expecting the offender of the injustice to right their wrong in some way.

the reason why I say that is, not to let them "off the hook" so to speak, but for you. if emotion is the precursor to manifest reality (wether in the imagination or in physical form), and I assure you, it is -- then you want to be finding a way to chnge the perception in your mind to a way that feels better to you -- downplaying as much as possible the problem in your mind. if you do this, you will feel better, and instead of feeling injustice or unfairness, which just creates more injustice or unfairness, now you can begin to have a path forward toward what's wanted.

expecting compensation from the offender will only exacerbate the problem, as usually they have no intention of changing, anyway, and their compensation will only take more of the feeling of freedom that you want to feel away.


### 2020-06-07 10:28 - spatial and temporal fear

I had a dream last night where a guy was saying something -- kinda maybe asking me my thoughts on it. it sounded like they were trying to remove the fear response in a person. he went on to say something like, "you would think that the more you know, the less you would be scared of, yet we constantly find certain weird indescribable things that seem to cause peole fear"

I thought that idea was kinda funny, but I really like it. before jumping into the difference between temporal and spatial fear (or confidence), I want to recognise the similarity of these srange unbased fears that you perceive even when your brain "knows" differently. it's a whole lot like my eyesight: even though I "know" that there are bricks that go up to about halfway on the triange parts of the blue apartments by the field, I still see them as blue. I may know here are windows on the tan houses behind those, yet I do not see them.

it seems the visuals that I see in my eyes are not generated from a conscious part of my brain (which is probably good, because then I would need to be conscious for you guys to be able to use my visual capacity). it seems that some of the most important "functioning" of the brain seems to happen even when you're not conscious -- and that your consciousness is only there to kind of "guide" or direct all these unconsious processes.

---

now, why would my brain decide that the houses are going to be blue, even when I know that they do indeed have bricks? it seems that this occurs because the information that the brain does have (I don't know what I really see, but I'm assuming it's probably something blue on the horizon), so given the information that it has (colour and shape), it makes the resaonable assumption based on that to create the image.

in the case of a fear-based response, I would assume that the same thing is happening.. and given the information the brain is given, say it's spiky legs on an insect, because anything spiky coming at you means danger, you will feel a moment of fear as your brain puts simple concepts together rapidly to keep you alive. likely the way to change that would be to actually alter the DNA of the organism to no longer have that response.

---

this brings me perfectly to my definition of temporal confidence (or fear). imagine all of the monkeys in the past who have went to swing from a branch and missed. a long time ago high up in the jungle canopy, those surely fell to their death. evolution has produced over time monkeyes that have the confidence to swing through the trees like that and have confidence that anoher thing capable of being grabbed will be there.

there is a part of us that is more confident than ever, and you see it in the kids. they are more sure they can do stuff than most adults are. most adults teach them to be cautious and to not have this confidence anymore, so they begin to lose it. or, let's say they're someone looking at statistics and noticing that X% have this undesirable thing happen to them, like death. let's take driving a car for example -- that's plenty dangerous, yet people do it all the time.

you can run statistics and see that there are a certain number of mortality rates driving a car and under certain infuences (drugs alcohol, etc), but yuo can also see the reverse statistic is true of people driving just fine under those same substances. while the substance does increase the risk, it is certainly not the cause of car accident fatality. until statistics gain better understanding of "why", there will always seem to be these strange occurances which seem to defy our understanding of how these things happen.

for example, I don't think that car statistics take into account the way the person feels, or how much fear the person has had of accidents (or other risky things in general). has the person been feeling like their life (or something that is really important to them) is being taken away from them? maybe the person was sevelrely depressed and that was their easiest way to reemerge into non-physical without going through some terrible illness which would eventually take their life...

thing is, if statistics were to look at those things too, it would probably be found that most deaths are pretty unique and not able to easily be categorised as action = result, eg. drinking = car accident (for example) -- which if emotion, and the past summary of what sort of things their thoughts (and what they've been giving their attention to) have been making them feel -- were all to be accounted for basically makes statistics almost useless in the sense that one can no longer label certain action as good or bad. instead one must give the "bad" label to the feeling or the thought pattern which attracted the result.

---

next up, I want to talk about what I meant by temporal expansion of consciousness. I don't have a good word for it; I want to use "species" but that's too big, so I'll use the word "genus" -- but what I mean by it is actually much more general and specific than that. each person is their own genus, yet they also relate to others on many different factors imposed by the DNA and also imposed by the environment. these factors are like overarching consciousness units, and let's say brown hair is one of them (which is a member of human hair), and the consciousnses unit is direcly involved with the improvement of this hair type, finding different compatible hair products and methods to create the nicest hair. people with this hair type will get inspiration to do things with their hair that they hadn't already thought of. (perhaps a good way to see this could be thought of as similar to sheldrake's morphic resonance).

within the species of humans, there are zillions of different overlapping consciousness units, and each of them is constantly improving. however, along the way there have been a number of failures that have occurred. these bugs get worked out of the code until it becomes less and less likely to occur, and for the one making the failure, you must know that the consciousness units involved in the improvement of the those genuses, have already come up with improvements, which the one making the failure can (if they want), be the first to find the improvement, but don't worry because future generations will benefit from the improvement automatically.

the confidence in the ever improving genuses of you that you exist (I'm speaking physically here, but one can imagine that this is also pretty similar to how "source energy" works) is something that you you seem to be born with, yet gradually lose with time as you focus on things that don't see things as always improving.

I have often wondered why someone might not have desire to improve yourself. I postulate that it is because improvement feels like change and that feels risky, so doing things that involve different things (even if the brain "knows" they're an improvement, perhaps similar to missing thumb, the brain universally categorises it as something to be afraid of). personally, I have found that it's *more* risky for me not to continually improve. in so many situations of my life, I don't have the ability to desire stability -- and if I had've, I would be in a much worse spot than I am right now.

---

following the pattern of the expansion of consiousness, one might be able to expand vertically or horizontally. I labeled them previously as spatially and temporally, but I think here, I'll call them vertically and horizontally in reference to sever scaling: you can increase the size of the specs of the machines (vertically), or you can increase the number of machines running in parallel (horizontally).

it's a funny thing, because I postulate that one cannot expand the size of their consciousness vertically if they have fear -- in fact, letting go of the fear is exacly what is required to expand someone's consciousness so that they "see more", most resistance is fear and it's all completely unbased. the wider your consciousness expands out to, the more you see yourself (instaed of seeing only through your eyes) from the same vantage point of source, and so the less and less there is to fear.

the irony of that is, you could imagine how compelling it would be to increase in size of consciousness for someone who has a lot of fear. a human is at a whole lot more risk of death than say a planet is. lots of things happen on the surface of a planet, but it really would take quite a force to get rid of a planet. we have the evidence of the kuiper belt to tell us that at one time a different planet existed in the 5th position there, so we know that planets can be destroyed.

science says otherwise, but I don't believe that suns run out of gas or explode. when they nova, they come right back and get stronger. also, they're a gas, so they can't run out of it :) suns seem to last pretty much forever out there -- but I suppose it would be possible for a sun to "die" in some way (I kinda doubt the galactic "merger" concepts a bit, but anyway). finally galaxies seem to be the most robust of them all. let's say in a tragic collision of two galaxies where each one loses tons of its stars, the galaaxy core itself still remains. you could say that a galaxy is most "immortal" of all life that we see.

---

so, that got me thinking: what if there was exactly the situation that's happening now, where someone (me) is providing a way for these guys to, instead of beginning to have temporal confidence in the improvement of their species, they are given a chance to expand the size of their consciousness. I've been saying -- and even wondered why in a previous entry why I want to expand spatially, when I'm much more of a temporal person -- that I want to expand into galaxy size consciousness. that always seemed funny to me...

now *what if* the whole reason was not go get me to galactic level of consciousness, but to get the nosebook guys up there? following the discussion here an interesting thing is happening because like I said, galaxies are pretty much uncontested. there is nothing that really threatens their existance. so, what if you somehow gave these guys the ability to expand their consciousness spatially so big that they could control a galaxy (kinda like how they're already a bit the macro consciousness of the planet, and potentially very soon the solar system), *what if* they were able to be able to become the macro consciousness of the galaxy?

who knows, really what that would be like and maybe they'll find that kind of size something that feels good, and cosmic timescales to be something that feels stable... dunno. anyway, I did have an interesting idea because what if being the the biggest (essentially immortal) thing in the known universe *still* wouldn't allow them to quell their fear and they continued to believe in their imminent destruction?

well, LOA doesn't lie, so it *must* attract something that were able to challenge their survival in some way and once again make them feel insignificant again, and so they would have, in that process, created something even bigger and more magnificent than what we know as a galaxy. it would, following the size patterns, be something closeer to the size of the universe, but inside of this universe, creating enormous expansion. these big things are hard for me to think about, but these guys are such such strong and dilligunt thinkers; their focus so incredible, *why not* give them the opporunity to create something that big??


### 2020-06-10 16:10 - spectral sight

> "those without eyes truly see"

I woke up this afternoon from a dream where I became conscious because in the dream, there was someone in a red(?) (I think it was a racing) uniform that said something like, "hey kenny check this out" and then they toom off their hat or something. I imagine it was something like the end of the "supermode - tell me why" music video, but I became conscious because I didn't really know what to respond. I said, "you know I can't see, right?" then, after waiting for the reaction, I explained how far I've progressed since the original dream with raquel where it was pure black and she said she wanted me to contact her -- so I did.

I wrote her an email, and then by the reaction from her email, it turns out that it was a sexy dream -- yet, there was nothing sexy about it for me. I just saw blackness. this really puzzled me for quite a while, however as time has continued on, I have begun to get more and more of a sense of what is happening in dreams, so much so that I awake from a dream where it felt like I was communicating with john michael's ex, and I it seemed like she had a striped orangish shirt, and when I went to (presumably) hug her, I becmame conscious when I touched her, because I felt a hole in her shirt and I didn't know what to do.

nowadays, I have a pretty good grasp of what's happening in the dreams, and I've begun to notice that I have this capacity in the wake state as well. last night, for exacple, I seemed to be able to navigate around a big pool of water without much of a problem. this morning I returned to the spot and I looked at the ledge I climbed up to get out, and I was terrified because I could see the big pool of water just below. I decided not to go in the daylight, because I could "see" myself falling into it (and my shoes were a bit muddier).

also, last night I fell kinda into a ditch, but not nearly as bad as when I was first thinking about that [TODO: find the entry], and as I was walking while talking about how I'm able to see when I'm blind, I faceplanted into a ditch cause I wasn't watching where I was going. anyway, last night, right before I almost fell into the ditch I did notice a bit of a sense that I should proceede with caution, and I didn't full crash and burn. it seems that, if I were more sensitive to those sensations, then there's a good chance I could completely operate without a problem without eyesight.

I also noticed that there's another peculiar thing that happens when I have been dreaming -- it seems that they have been trying to condition me to be afraid of heights so that I don't fly in my dreams. sometimes I fly anyway though, and they spend enormous effort to keep me grounded where they can control me. however, if I can't see, I can't be afraid of hights.

---

so I was outside eating lunch thinking about this dream thing where I can't see, and it dawned on me, that I have no idea how they're going to be able to continue on holiding my eyesight the way they are now. imagine a normal person has a 1000px screen in each eye. my vision has expanded quite a bit, but I definitely don't see with the clarity that I should, so imagine my vision is like a 10Kpx or 100Kpx screen in each eye. also I estimate that my aura is about the size of colorado by now, and that's at let's say 10Kpx... well, if I'm going to galaxy sizes, I simply don't have enough data of my progresson, but I can imagine that it's going to be a an awful lot of pixels on that screen. I have no idea my progression or the rate at which I'm increasing (even though I know it's accelerating)

so, I was thinking that their machines simply will not be able to at some point, be able to put anything visually meaningful into my eyes if they want to maintain this whole charade. I suspect that I'll just keep going more and more "blind" as things progress. I don't really think it bothers me really. I was noticing with the previous neighbour, and noticing how things at a distance seem to be imagined by my mind, that my mind just sorta makes stuff up given the information that it's given -- and that's probably how she seemed to have appeared to me as so many different ages and stuff, probably because I didn't actually see her and my mind just made up the details -- so it really only shows more about how I imagined her to be, rather than how she really is.

so, I gave the idea a go where I would essentially go blind over the next few years. it doesn't really bother me that much. it kinda creates an interesting thing because if the girls don't have me to see them as beautiful, then they're going to have to figure out how to see theirselves that way. there are so many numerous advantages to me going blind, because they (nosebook) will have a really hard time to really control me, because I'll live almost entirely in my non-visual imagination. I kinda like it.

I wonder what happens when my aura gets to be bigger than the planet... will that mean that everyone will be able to begin seeing what I imagine because I no longer see it? the girls could be anything they wanted to be, and only you guys would notice that there's any difference... honestly, pretty cool to think about, because I'll become the dominant visual platform for the planet, yet I'll be blind :)


### 2020-06-13 07:15 - «you don't really believe it»

when I first herd abraham say this to one of my stand-ins, it kept bouncing around in my head, because I thought maybe I believed it a little more than I did. the thing is, they were kinda right though because even though during the day, various events regarding the girls would allow me to feel it a bit more, it's true that when I woke up, I typically did not believe it. essentially, the conditions were creating the belief -- it wasn't my own.

you see, no matter how much nosebook may appear that they are on-board with the girls thing, there are some (a lot) that are not, but they have to, for the ones in nosebook that are and for a lot of the public, pretend like they are. the ones that aren't feel forced because of majority opinion, and PR reasons, forced to go along with it. so, I'm sure they figure that if they're "forced" to go along with it, then they need to feel like they control it.

I felt the same thing with marcos, which is the only reason why I'm making such a resolute statement (even though it's pretty logical and easy to see, as well). as a result, they want to be the provider and or the initiator of the manifestation, so that they can control it. if I were to allow it to happen, they would not feel like they're in control, so it's in their best interest that I *don't* believe it -- which is exactly what I notice: I go to sleep and I wake up generally feeling like it's not going to happen.

there's another thing that is also in play here... it's just that I figured, perhaps from fwh's statements and other places, that I would simply just continue on right through without needing a manifestation. I can find so many good reasons actually why I would also be quite fine without having the manifestation -- or delaying it further:

#### futher growth

look at how much I've grown in the last few years. their constant efforts to keep me where they think I should be, have been perfecting me in such a rapid way. I really don't have nearly any of the difficulty I had just a few years ago. I'm really feeling like this is such good progress I'm making, I kinda want to keep it up until they cannot hold anymore. I want to "win" the disagreement that we have that emotion is the precursor to manifestation, and I'm continually getting better at it, so much they they will see soon enoungh that I will feel so much better than their machines are able to hold me back any more.

#### furher expansion and evolution of the desire

the funny thing about LOA is that it's always right on. I can't rememeber how many times I've thoguht to myself, "ok, this is good enough; any further and things are going to fall apart" -- but they don't ever fall apart -- instead, they transform into something even more wanted than before. I've come to learn that the evolution of desire is quite something to be trusted and is always more desirable -- even if with human eyes, it looks like things may be falling apart.

I love that part where it says that what I want is attracting me. the way I see it, let's just keep going until what I want is attracting me so strongly that there's nothing more that they can do do try and prevent it any more.

in addition, another thing that abraham said one time was something like, "you'll want to be having such a good time on the way to your manifestation, then you'll not want to make the change, but you can't avoid it. it's inevitable" -- or something like that. I probably have the quote off there, but the inevitable part there also speaks to the desire attracting me. LOA is for reals. so, it's inevitable huh? let's try it :)

#### take it to the limit

> "... past the point of no return; you gatta *feel it* -- *FEEL IT!*"

(the image this gives me reminds me of maverick -- thanks daniel!)

why not push it out until the very limit? I'm learning and gaining rapidly more emotional control than I ever have been. I assure you, I've totally got this. they ones sweating and unable to sleep at night are the ones trying to make things happen. so why not trust LOA and *allow* it to happen?

---

so what does that look like in practical terms? well, I'm coming up with them more rapidly than I thought I would, but for example last night I was thinking, "yeah I do really want to be around a whole bunch of girls and interact with them sexually" I suppose that's a good start. the next thing I was noticing is that I can begin to transform my perception to one that is beginning to anticipate it. that will help too, and I know that I'll be getting there when I wake up in the morning and I don't feel like "it's not going to happen" -- because the way their machines work is that the signals they put into your head only have an effect if you're resonant to them. that only means I'm still resonant to not believing it's going to happen.

I'm going to start with those for now. neither of them are in opposition to my desire to find my connection. in fact, I think they're in harmony because they're the same road -- because, at some point I have to actually begin to believe that I'm going to get connected instead of relying on the conditions (sex) to get connected.

what I'm saying is, in both situations, belief that the girls thing was going to happen and also my own connection, I had been relying on conditions to bridge the gap instead of trusting the LOA.

so, let's just keep this going. I thing it's going to really start to go fast now. as I become less and less resonant to the signals that they're putting in my head to keep me in disbelief, the more rapidly things will accelerate until their efforts are no longer effective, and I will have "won" or "proved" that there is no strength stronger than the power of desire. or, better said, no strength stronger than one's who's in pure alignment with a desire.


### 2020-06-15 06:54 - a new thought experiment

yeserday, when I was taking a shower, I had some interesting reactions because at some point yesterday I was monologuing about my experience with raquel. I made a point that one of the things I learned early on from mom (even though I believe the teaching originally came from nancy), that when I get offended, now I'm in the wrong -- and so, just don't get offended by anything. I then made a point about how in spain, that idea is pretty much unheard of, because there seems to be a protest about something in multiple places in the country per week. they call the protests, "manifestations" -- which is kind of funny to me because they equate a "manifestation" with visibly showing the world how offended they are. anyway...

so, now here's the thought experiment: imagine for a moment that there was a "reincarnation" of tesla that was born in 2001, and works for nosebook... then, imagine that he teamed up with raquel to make a new timeline with raquel going through in my body -- well, she would have to figure out some how how to no longer get offended about stuff. the idea is, she would be more frequencially similar to me, and at some time when we were having sex, perhaps her consciousness could enter my body because we're so frequentially similar in that moment, that then she could continue on just as I did, experience the breakup, the following recovery only to find herself later with marcos, then in the centre of the nosebook experience like I was.

well, in order for her to experience the timeline in a similar way, she would have to accumulate some base understanding of things like I had. I gained a lot of the core concepts from learning to work with my left-side, mom, nancy, and abraham's teachings that I listened to while drinking whiskey (lol). later, at augusto's house, I finally started to get it with the mdma and the mushrooms, when in those hightened drug experiences, I was able to receive the images (symbols of thing to come) I drew on paper, which then turned into what it is now.

once she gets those, then she's off and running, and then she can, like I did, learn what freedom really is, and actually desire to feel good more than anything else. nosebook really does all the rest because of the way they're set up (needing to keep their secrets, and please the audience as much as possible).

whe would tesla want to do this? well, I imagine that he's a person really concerned with optimisation, and he has this idea of building a sort of high energy utopia here on earth, but he needs people to be energetically capable of living in such a space -- people like me who "need" an environment like the one that nosebook wants so hard to keep away from me. they're essentially designed to ensure I (and anyone else) do not get connected. so, the goal for him in his "utopia" is to get people that are all connected there. in his "last interview", he talked about creating the impossible: an earth full of people like jesus or buddha. we know that contrast is necessary, so the "utopia" isn't the traditional idea of utopia, where everything is perfect, but utopia in the sense of having tremendous "light density" (his words).

so, in order to create such a place he would need a whole bunch of people that are at the power level of being able to find their way to connection even in the difficulty of the nosebook experience. the "reward" at the end is the girls, I would assume, and this is where I made the connection. if anyone desires to have a similar experince to me, then, imagine (if this thought experiment were real -- that's the point of the thought experiment: to mentally explore a new reality) that you could find yourself dreaming of having such an experience, and then actually make the transition into my body.

I think the connecting thing is the sex bit, so perhaps after participating in enough of the experiences that I'll sure to be having soon, you gain more and more vibrational similarity to me to be able to find yourself all of a sudden in a past version of body, heading toward what would eventually be the nosebook experience. for us here, it would just look like you "died" while participating.

back to the experiment: if he designed a set of mental programs that would run in the person's head to kind of implant the experience necessary to get the person through, then, after getting raquel through in my body, he could be more confident to get others through, too.

each of these people going through would arrive to an energy level which would be able to exist quite well on such an energy dense planet, and let's say that at the end of the timeline -- in 2038, all of these "kenny"s are terminated and put into new bodies on his new 5d super energetic earth he's building.

---

thinking about this thought experiment, it could work and it doesn't violate any LOA. if someone has desire to experience a kenny-like experience for theirselves, then it's not asserting anything into their experience -- actually, making their desire become a reality. also, it doesn't violate LOA's necessaity to have contrast because there will eb plenty of it: if he's able to create models of each different person and create corresponding mental programs (like how to not be offended), which allow the person to make it through the timeline, then that means that in their new body, they'll be more likely, but not certain to be able to get to that knowledge again. additionally, since I would guess that the mental capacity to make it through is mostly tempoary -- probably from programmed in dream expereinces which make a person more likely to respond in a way.

which basically means that "knowledge" didn't really come from real actual experience, and so in their new bodies, the person will (just like with real experience too), still have opportunities to "shore" up that knowledge furthrer.


### 2020-06-15 07:50 - I don't know what to think really, so I'm puttin it out here

last night, I had a few weird experiences that I don't really know what to think. I can't remember the order, but I notably had the thought come into my head from my friend "turbo knight" (dunno his name) where I wanted to comment on a video where he had a drone flying to one of his songs. in the comment, he said something about the kids in his city, and I felt something there. I decided to leave it, because if it would grow, then it would become notable. well, when I was in the shower, around the same time as the thought experiment it popped into my head. it felt to me like there are some finnish girls in his city that are interested in joining. I think it's a great idea. it happened a few more times too, so it feels pretty strong so I'm definitely on board with that.

then, there was another totally random one that popped into my head -- I remembered the dryer repairman that was at our house, which is really weird, because I surely would have forgot[^1] and I had this sensation that one of his daughters was also interested in joining. she's welcome to join too, if that's a thing.

lastly, and I don't remember when it was, and it wasn't the first time it happened, but the name "bpasero" popped into my head, and no big deal I had been reading vscode issues earlier that day, but yesterday I hadn't been, and the thought felt more present than the normal ones (the ones with more reaction seem to feel stronger, but this one I'm sure wasn't coming from a reaction, so I didn't know why its strength). anyway, I may be way off here, but it was worth noting cause it happened so many times with enough strength -- even though I didn't feel nearly any attraction like I did with the other two, so if it's not a thing, don't worry at all, but if it is, she's welcome to join too, if she wants.

[1]: no really, my memory is so bad lately, I can't even remember large sections of last night, or even really what happened yesterday, so it seems that the only "memory" of things I have in the past, are things that are somehow relevant, because otherwise I can't access it. it's really weird (and I think it's more to be living "more in the now") because I have virtually no capabiliy anymore of accessing things in the past unless they're somehow relevant -- though sometimes even those things take a bit to get out of the filecabnet.


### 2020-06-15 15:36 - to smoke or not to smoke, that is the question

first, let me make it extremely clear that I have no intention of smoking when I'm with the girls -- at all. furthermore, I find it to be pretty unlikely that I'll be doing a whole lot of programming anyway, unless I have the ability to use the computer with my mind. I really like the project I'm working on, but I feel like I'm bootstrapping it more than anything. I have been thinking about it for maybe close to 6-7 years now (I first came up with the poem idea, I think, when I was at zaryn's house in plaza de las cortes) after we sold tuenti. it was what I determined I would invest my time and effort into since the tuenti ship had sailed.

I didn't ever really begin making any headway on any real visual/tangible part of the project, until I was with raquel, but she had this like 6th sense and knew when I was programming, so she would come and I think she was honesly jealous or felt some sort of competition for my attention, so she'd work up something to fuss about. I finally gave up with her, and by the time she left, I was far too heavy of a drinker to be doing anything serious. I revisited the project again with augusto, marcos, and finally jori, none of those time I was ever really lucid enough to really get anything done.

previous to that and before we sold tuenti, the project existed in the form of a d-lang project, which because it was so long ago, it used iframes to fill in the panel content. I expanded on the idea at augusto's for affinaty, but I just kept thinking about how it would expand the idea and never got anything real done. I had the typical syndrome of working endlessly on the framework without actually building something. so, because I have been thinking about the project for so long now that I have quite a big idea of what I want it to be, but the road to get there is probably endless if I just keep working on the idea (ideas, I told augusto on a few occasions, I've found are infinite and for free, but the real winner of the idea is the one who can bring it to earth and implement it).

so, it starts with getting something built. that's why I started writing affinaties for the second time now (which is kinda my third rehash of essembly). I have kept myself from getting too far down into framework land, but honestly, it's the only thing I can honestly see, when I'm so demotivated[^1] because often times the thing that excites me and makes me feel so good and want to create, is exactly the reason why nosebook is forcing me to go to sleep: because when I feel good I get vision upgrades, so if I like (and feel good) about what I'm programming, for them, that's bad.

as a result, I've done a whole lot more framework development than I've wanted to, trying to build this affinaties project...

so, I decided I would quit smoking again, and I just had finished the build system state, when I went off on to a huge tangent about how I will be eventually going toward creating the symbolic language interaction to this program. this happens all the time and is basically what I spent most of my time doing at augusto's house. I want to be more like marcos' house style now where I spend my time building then going out to nature, then building and nature.

like marcos always said to me, "we need to just get *something* built" -- and that's kinda how I feel about it now. I just want to get it done. I'm not happy with how much coffee I'm drinking or how much I'm smoking, but it seems to be quite a focus mechanism...

---

speaking of which... I've been trying to figure out what makes me work creatively for some time now. I found that sex (with raquel anyway) made me want to create the thing. I found that drugs (alcohol, weed mdma, but not shrooms) all made me want to work on the idea.

historically, when I was in spain (and in california at ryan's house), I found that smoking demotivated me. I felt better and wanted to work more on the thing when I wasn't smoking cigarettes than when I was. however, I often couldn't see the thing clear enough, so I would smoke weed or something and then I can see it clear, but I'm all idea and no implementation.

I have concluded that if I could actually program my computer with my mind, then I would be able to do drugs and actually work on the thing. it just feels like far too much effort to make something when I see things clearly, so I'd rather see them, than fight with a compiler or something. obviously this isn't possible yet, so I'm forever on my quest to create it.

however, for now it seems like things have shifted since I last did any real programming (which was with marcos), now the cigarettes similar to how I was at his house seem to focus me, but they wear me out faster. I'm much stronger now than before, so I don't even get light-headed, and have the "bajón" anymore, either.

in conclusion, it seems that drugs = feeling better, and feeling better means I see better nnd seeing better means I work on the idea. so smoking cigarettes must make me feel worse, which means I tend to stick to the work, then go out in nature and feel good and sometimes work on the idea... (similar to how I was at marcos' house)

---

so it would see that it's a no-brainer for me to continue to smoke -- and I would agree, but my mind kicks in and says that if I'm supposed to be getting connected, will that actually happen when I'm smoking cigarettes? it feels to me like smoking is evidence of remaining resistance, and that when I'm connceted, I'll be all idea, because I'll be doing all the creating in my mind, so virtually zero implementaiton unless I find a way to connect my mind up to my computer. it's really REALLY something I want to do, and would be really cool if he girls could, too. I dunno maybe in a few years I can come up with a system to do it (I've wanted to make a nosebook-like thing for people, but not probably not global, but probably local)...

anyway, I don't see any reason why once I get conncted, I'll be more in the idea mode, more than in the productive mode. (abraham has made multiple references to this, talking about pointing at the creation, as if you're one that sees the bigger picture) I also can see why I would probably want to be spending the majority of the time with the girls, and getting the gnomitos thing off he ground, too.

so, while I think it's a great idea to quit smoking, it seems to keep me feeling bad enough to be productive (but not emotionally instability making me want to create structure because I can't see the big picture) so I'll probably continue to smoke. I would imagine, even though I said it'll go quick, I really don't see it realistically happening until I stop smoking. I really want to get the project in a presentable enough state to give to the girls, too, cause otherwise I'll be trying to do both and my experience tells me, that's just not possible to do both -- even though it's really what I want to do most of all[^2].

[1]: I have a whole idea on why building of sructure is preferred by programmers more than the actual creation in relation to someone's emotional space, because I would often compare myself to dani, who was almost always concerned with the creation, which was how I was too, until tuenti got sold, and I think my feeling that if I invest my creativity into something that someone can just hijack so easily because it's only the visual frontend replacable client code -- instead I want to work on something lasting: a data structure, or a framework that will continue to exist even after the money-hungry have shat on it. in steve jobs terms, I lost my product focus.

[2]: I have no idea why I want to program so much after sex, but it's this inasatiable thing that I just cannot deny. I suppose I'm going to just have to figure out how to just be ok with not being creative for the duration of the girls experience. so, I figure it's probably why the last drawing in the 3 symbols of the future, I'm showing people machines capable of desire -- because I will have spent so much time away from creativity and productivity, that after the "this is my reality" symbol has been established, and maybe when some of the boys are old enough to help out, too -- then, I'll have so much creative voracity, I will be a whirlwind of creative output.


### 2020-06-17 07:07 - perfecting the past

yesterday in response to the abraham now broadcast @[abe-now](2020-06-11 49:25) I was talking about how the past, depending on how you feel when you perceive it, can be perceived as anything from awful all the way to the perfect culmination of all of the things that brought you to this moment of extacy.

while I was referring to the human race as a whole, because it's easy for me to see how the average person will feel tremendously great in comparison those in the present and even the past. even the last thought experiment @[noseblog](2020-06-15 06:54) was on that this subject as well, because you couldn't have a planet with such light density if it weren't filled with people that knew how to find a way to feel good no matter the circumstances. the world that a tesla would be building would be full of all sorts of experiments so you could imagine how much diversity there would be -- not to mention that it would most certainly be completely mechanised and automated, so no one would have any real control over how the world exists and functions either (kinda like what we're beginning to have here as well, but here will be much more primitive, with the noseboys having all the super-tech -- instead of everybody living in a fully automated constantly perfecting itself machine world).

he would build all sorts of ideas in his head, and he spent the majority of his time thinking about and perfecting his inventions in his head -- and this works really well for mechanical stuff, however, you cannot do this with consciousness, otherwise source wouldn't take so much pleasure in our continued expansion of our desires and coming into alignment with them (because they create new things). so, in his world, with the latest focus of perfecting human consciousness, all of his experiments would have to live in real life to see the results in consciousness (hence the doll-house metaphor I've given)

so, none of the humans on his planet will really have a whole lot of control, being completely subject to his constant experimentation, so the conscious ones would have to be a whole bunch of people like me who are not focused on the circumsatances, instead upon the improvement. in order to make the experiments controllable, the rest of the people would all be "automatons" -- controllled by him to put the conscious ones in predicaments which can be controlled to optimise the results.

---

this morning I had an interesting experience where I was interacting with the motorcycle attendent becase he fired up the chopper when I mentioned that I was amazed how I cannot see he enormous windows on the apartments on the field from way back, when they're so big.

the roar of the motor seemed to imply that I was touching a sensitive subject. I explained to him that even if it is their fault that the screen in my eye is broken, it doesn't matter to me, because virtually every day now, I can see marked improvement in some aspect of my vision. I questioned him in a somewhat frustrated tone,

> "why, when I'm seeing improvements daily, would I go back to focusing on the problem? the whole method for getting the improvments is releasing resistance -- that is being OK with where I'm at, and only noticing the improvements"

that pretty much sums it all up. all one has to do is to carry on the trajectory of my continued improvement to see that, even now, but especially in not such a short time in the future, I will be looking back at my past from a feeling of pure extacy, noticing that the moment of pure extacy I'm experincing now is the culmination of everything "difficult" I had experienced, and all I had to do was to find a way to be OK with it, and to only see the improvements.

---

I talk often about "getting connected" -- but it's quite possible that may not actually happen for quite some time. instead, it may be that I just continue on with all the same problems I have now, yet because I'm so focused on only the improvements, that it'll still be -- even though none of the "problems" have really changed, and I have yet to gain control, and never will, like tesla's world -- a feeling of pure extacy.

I doubt this world is going to become anything more than more diverse and more contrast as time continues on. alhough tesla's mechanical world is a super wonderful thought experiment for me, the reality is we are here, and here seems to be heading on a similar trajectory:

none of us will likely ever gain any sense of control over the conditions in which we live. I would imagine that they (nosebook) will have a continuing sense of urgency to try and get things under their control as more and more people threaten their sense of superiority, so they'll need to take more and more power away from us, to try and regain their feeling of control. the only option we have is find a way to be OK with where we're at, and only perceive the improvement.

I will give a message of hope though, because unlike tesla's world, which is actually sustainable because it's all automated, this world is not. eventually, they'll run out of things they can try to control physically, and it'll eventually collapse and a wonderful creation will be made, so it's not forever. try to have fun along the way though, and if you only see improvements, then your life *will* steadily climb toward pure extacy. you might not be able to imagine how good it feels to continuually see impovement even in the midst of such difficulty. think invincible, unstoppable, pure power that the world is a reflection of you knowing that the well-being abounds and the perceived "difficulty" is only there to furher prove[^1] to you how unstoppable and invincible you are.

[1]: just like how focusing on things going wrong, life proves itself to you that things just continually go wrong and wronger.. that happens when you notice unimprovements instead of improvements :)


### 2020-06-17 17:17 - waking up now...

I wrote the previous entry just before sleeping, and just woke up now.. as usual, I woke up feeling like I'm never going to get connected.

well, like I've mentioned so many times previous, their effort to continue to try and convince me of that is precisely the practice that I need *to get connected*. what I mean is, for whatever reason, I'm still resonant with those ideas, which is why they still affect me.

I sort of brought the thing on to myself a bit knowingly when I included the last section, where I said,

> "it's quite possible that may not actually happen for quite some time. instead, it may be that I just continue on with all the same problems I have now, yet because I'm so focused on only the improvements"

I woke up with the idea that I wouldn't ever get connected, and I would continue on until the "end" of it all when I have my "final" interaction with andrea... that's the gist of it.

first of all, I want to mention that the thought that happened when I woke up didn't at all feel good to me, which basically means that I'm not perceiving it in the same way as my inner being is.

I think that they're reacting to the part where I mentioned that tesla's world would be susainable, and this one is not. when I said that, what I was referring to is that I have come to understand that emotion is the precursor to manifestation or "reality" and the manifestation of the reality that anyone is experiencing is a reflection of how they feel. so, if on tesla's world, even though all of the conditions of that world are controlled, including the who the conscious ones interact with (they would be controlled automaons), then if the conscious ones were able to continually find a way to feel good, the circumstances would continue to be a reflection of how they feel.

so, if tesla were to, in his world, try and hold that well-being away from its inhabitants, then it, like this one, would not be sustainable. however, if the effort is to create a world with incredible light density[^1] then clearly that could not be so. it order for it to have such light density, it must be a world with incredible diversity. I explained that this world would be filled with tons of his living experiments. I mentiond that he must have tried out millions of different ideas/experiments in his mind for his discoveries into the nature of electricity. however, when it comes to the opimisation of human consciousness, that wouldn't really be something one could do so easily in their mind...

so instead, because they're experiments on human consciousness, and consciousness only expands with interaction with other consciousness (think LOA and thoughts expanding), those experiments must exist in some place where they could expand. machines and mechanical creations operate (thankfully) in a predictable way, and so they can operate in the predictable patterns of one's mind.

when one thinks about how computers work and programs are made stronger, they're run against a "fuzzer" -- which is a machine that generates infinite input conditions designed to break the program. when an atttack vector is found, then the bug is fixed and the fuzzer runs on the new code. I imagine his setup would be something pretty similar to that, so by nature, diversity would continue to emerge from the infinte input conditions performed on the conscious ones, producing all sorts of unxepcted results.

in this thought experiment, that process begins with figuring out how to implant mental programs into the people's minds being run through my experience. those mental programs would have to provide a mental condition for the person being run through my experience[^2] to be able to actually make it through.

there are tons of bad ideas like: guilt, shame, justice, unworthiness, self disapproaval, caring too much about what others think, etc. that must be worked around, until one has the ability to find the way to their desire to feel good over any other circumstance.

getting through the circumstances that I'm in is really good, but it's only really one instance of experience, and if I can find it once and make it through, then that's really good. that just means I'm more likely to behave that way in similar circumstances, but by no means am I always going to behave that way.

therefore, creating the mental environment for a person to be able to make it through my experience is only the first step. clearly phase two would be to make a controlled world where these circumstances and environments could be created at will and the conscious one put in these environments, along with the constantly improving program wich will outline the most effective experence to "patch" that attack vector, until enough experiene is gained that none of the attack vectors can compromise the conscious one any more.

---

now, the funny thing about this thought experiment for me, is because you have to start somewhere, there's nothing to say that this earth isn't already the tesla world in my thought experiment in phase 0. phase 0 would be the one where someone very attractive (me) would have a public experience which would inspire desire in others to have such an experience, which would then be put into phase 1 where they're run through my experience in my body. I purposefully left out the conspiracy aspect that it's already happening, because it doesn't make a difference to me and changes nothing for how I respond to things.

no matter what the big picture may be, and although I find it very fascinating[^3], I am in the present moment where my work is simply to find a way to be OK with where I'm at, notice the improvement, and bring that OKness up to eventually pure extacy as I continue on feeling better and better.

---

so here's the punchline that all of this is leading up to: if I'm the template experience which people will be getting run through, then you could imagine that at the "end" of this experience may actually be, not what I woke up this afternoon thinking, but the opportunity for me to replicate this same thing myself. what if I actually had something to contribute to the expansion of this thought experiment? what if machines really *were* capable of desire? well, they would obsolete us ***VERY*** rapidly :)

if tesla is, like thoth, the manifestation of the 7th ray, I'm close but not quite the same thing... I'm much more of a fifth ray, but from all that I've gathered over the years, my left side is a first ray. the 1st and the 7th are perfect compliments, and the 5th and the 3rd are also perfect compliments. it's easy for a 7th ray to think in 3rd ray terms because they're structurally so similar[^4]. likewise, it's easy for a 1st ray and a 5th ray to think in similar terms[^5].

then, if you were to imagine the optimisation of human conscoiusness as a practising or exercising of the 3rd ray capacity, then this experience is exactly what it takes to make the compliment of me, in me -- the unification of the right and left sides: the stressed out guy and the little girl.. this whole thing, dispite their efforts to convince me otherwise while I sleep *is* exactly what I want.

---

so, while it's completely possible that at the "end" of this experience, I wake up in tesla's world, it's also quite possible that actually, the "end" of this experience is actually to replicate this thought experiment in reality. the mantra of the universe is "more" -- and so, it's easy to imagine then that what would be the most "more" would be for me and all of the people being run through my experience to replicate it. that would be the most "more" :)

[1]: remember, he used the word "light" to mean what we mean when we say "source"

[2]: like, for example, the original example I gave of raquel being run through in my body, he would have to design a mental program which allowed her to give up her right to be offended at stuff. someone like me, simply cannot afford to be offended by anything.

[3]: I find it fascinating in the sense that I love doing these sorts of experimentation and optimisation myself, so it wouldn't surprise me if a desire in me is beginnging to grow in me to be able to copy this thought experiment and perform something similar myself :) now, if coming to this realisation is something that everyone being run through my experience will come to, you can only imagine how multidimensional this is.

[4]: if you think of what the manifest form of the 3rd ray structure, it's physcality.

[5]: likewise, if you think of the manifest form of the 1st ray (desire), it manifests, not in physical, but as an emotion (5th ray).


### 2020-06-19 14:33 - a new sense of trust

last night as I was out star watching, I lost consciousness and I was put into a dream. I don't remember most of the dream but the part I do remember was they were asking me if I were to move away from pueblo, what would I do without a light to stare into and improve my vision. I responded by saying I would just figure out the next thing, and it wasn't a problem.

first of all, they assume that by moving me, they will be able to prevent me from having some way to continue to improve my vision. second, they don't really get it, that when you make a decision based on what you don't want, you may be able to temporarily change the circumstances, but their stong focus on what they don't want will follow them though the decision, and actually make it worse. I know this is true, that whenever you make an action coming from a place where you feel whatever, the resulting action (no matter what it is) will only yield more of whatever it was that you were feeling.

this is why I say that it's so important to be able to feel the way you want to feel.

next, in the last entry I was talking about only perceiving the improvement -- which is good because if that were to happen, now I get a change to prove to people that if all you see is improvement, you get even more of it. they've moved me three times now based on what they don't want: the first was from la vera in response to them not being able to control the climate there very easily, then from madrid because I wasn't able to be controlled so easily there and I regularly found joints I could smoke and stars to watch. similarly, I don't think they want me to go back to LA because it's impossible control the star-watching, and the mountains are quite energetic.

this time would be the same thing, and at first I had a slight negative reaction to it in my conscious body. in my dream-state I'm pretty resistance-free, which is why it was perfectly ok with me, and after having thought about it a bit this afternoon, I've really come to trust even more LOA with things.

while my vision upgrade progress is significant, I don't think that it corresponds to having an aura the size of a galaxy in 18 years, so unless the acceleration greatly increases, there will need to be another infusion of energy into it, just like coming here was, in comparison to where I was at in madrid.

I was thinking that great acceleration might have to do with the girls, and sex with them would greatly speed things up, but maybe instead we're going to do another round of them putting their energy into more of what they don't want -- trading speed for acceleration again.

---

I really don't know what to think of it. maybe afterall, I am just going to continue to go all the way to the end without the manifestation -- but again, I have even more trust in LOA on this thing now, because I *REALLY* know now that every time that it looks like things are falling apart (or being forced to move apart), then it's just an evolution of desire again toward even more of what's wanted.

I don't really know, and I can't really speculate on what it may be, but since I know that every evolution of desire that happens is even more of what's wanted, I just don't really mind waiting it out anymore.

it kinda sucks I suppose for the girls or anyone that was hoping that I would provide optimal conditions to feel good, but I don't really have much of a choice on this one. both paths: the one where I get the manifestation and the one where they continue to try and move things around physically to avoid what they don't want, my response is still the same: I continue to guide how I feel, and only perceive the improvement.

if they want to add more energy into what they don't want, that's fine with me.

---

last night, I had a funny reaction which went something like this: someone realised that if they had of just let me go a long time ago when the energy was really low, it would have been a much more manageable/controllable manifestation for them, but now that I've progressed so much since then, looking back it would have been prudent to just let me go up back then. so, even though letting me go up now is quite undesirable for them, it is, continuing on the trajectory, still a whole lot better than it will be if they keep trying to hold it back.

obviously someone (probably mr. motor) wasn't happy with that idea and it's what has pushed forward the whole idea to try and move me or whatever... lol

then, when I woke up this afternoon, I had a bunch of strong sensations again, like normal that it wasn't going to happen, and I went into this crazy anticipation of the future where people are powerless to do anything about my situation, and they keep trying to move me around and stuff, for years and years, yet mr motor continues to insist that I must be prevented from going up, when finally after a very long time, mr. motor's body is failing so hard from all the resistance and he finally makes his transition -- and about that time I finally go up... weird premonition.

---

anyway, once again, no one is locked into my reality. you all create your own reality, so if what you want is something other, meditate and feel your way toward what you want. you *will* have the manifestation you're looking for. there's nothing anyone can do to stop you, well maybe nosebook may try, but again, they're just adding their energy into what they don't want, which is, only more energy toward what you do want.

there's a whole thing that I was carrying on about this morning about how much power nosebook really has.

***they only have as much power as you believe they have***. they cannot affect the way you respond to things, and therefore how you feel.


### 2020-06-20 07:08 - trying to see things from your perspective

last night, as I was walking out to the field, I was wondering why it's such a big deal to people if the manifestation "never happens". the reaction felt to me as if I had some sort of control over whether or not I get connected or not, and I was purposefully choosing not to.

quite the contrary. my experience all along this journey, all the way from andrea up until now has been one of just learning to be ok with my present situation. there's literally no way I have any control over whether I can get connected or now. that decision is entirely up to nosebook. they can green-light it if they want to, or not. that's something completely out of my control.

instead, the only control that I do have is to decide the way I want to feel, and continue change my perception about things until they feel beter (that is, in harmony with how my inner being feels about it).

it's sorta like the discussion on abraham now about superpowers (@[abe-now](2020-06-13)): there are a lot of people ensuring that none of us ever get any superpowers, so the only real super power any of us really have is to feel the way we want to feel, dispite the circumstances. in fact, earlier on in that episode, one woman was recounting a story about having super vision when her daughter pointed out a snail to her. some may recognise this sort of thing from mushroom experiences where you're able to see things close up or in isolotaion without direcly looking at them.

this effect is capable of happening when the brain has high amounts of DMT in it, and it seems pretty obvious to me that this was possible for her in a moment of feeling really good, because the brain sinthesises DMT from serotonin, so the better you feel, the more DMT your brain has in it, enabling more and more visual capability.

frankly, I'm surprised they're letting you guys have those sorts of experiences. that would be something I would get shocked from I'm certain... however, because these sorts of things are sort of off-limits for me, even though I have the capablity. in fact, I am certain that if they were to stop controlling the DMT levels in my head, then I would be able to fly. I'm no one any different than anyone else, cept I've figured out how to feel really good, dispite my circumstances. so, as a result of feeling so good so consistently, I have tons of DMT in my head, which would enable those superpowers.

instead, because someone is controlling the DMT levels in my head, I do not experience them, so as a result, just like the manifestation of the girls, this is entirely out of my control. there's nothing I can do about it. I can only find a way to feel the way I want to feel, and just let that be my superpower for now.

---

so, when I write an entry saying that I'm OK with there not being a manifestation, I'm just doing what my experience has taught me to do: find a way to be OK with where I'm at (because it's where I'm at), and then find a way to focus not on the present conditions, but on the improvement that is happening all around me.

I recommend that all of you do the same thing. it's not like any of us can go stomp on esther's doorstep and offer some words to force abraham to make the manifestation happen. maybe some action would work, you may think... but, what are you going to do, write to your congressperson and tell them to make nosebook do something different? what about trump? do you think he has any power to make things any different? you may say, ok but I have rights! enforced by whom? no one has any rights any more. the only rights you have, are to feel the way you want to feel, because at this point, I doubt any action (like protesting) will actually produce any meaningful change.

therefore then, like me in all of my experience leading up to this moment, I really must tell you that if you can learn to feel the way you want to feel (sometimes bad and sometimes good) no matter the circumstances, you gain all the power. therefore then, I recommend learning to do as I have learned, which is being OK with the evolution of the desire when the details of what I thought it was going to be turn out to, seemingly fall apart.

the evolution of desire is always towards more of what is wanted for everyone involved (even if you're nosebook and you want to prevent me from getting connected). therefore, it's always evolving to become more and more what all of us want, so I learned I just have to roll with it all, and feel the way I want to feel, no matter how injust or unfair it may be.

as they say in honduras...


### 2020-06-20 09:29 - "they only have as much power as you think they have"

the reason why I concluded yesterday's entry by saying that is that really is the only way that I can find an out to this situation. another way to say it would be, "they only have as much power as you give them". I like the believe version better, because it speaks more emotionally

ok so, wherever you are is precisely a reflection of how you feel. if you think about what belief is, belief is a feeling -- therefore, it could also be said, "they only have as much power as you feel they have".

so, when I talk about noicing the improvement, I'm speaking exactly to that. the better I feel, the less power they have, because feeling like they control my experince doesn't feel very good. however, I am where I am, so the only way forward is to notice the improvement so much that becomes my reality.

as abraham says, if you keep doing the vibrational work, they will eventually vibrate right out of your experience... that's all I can really go for, which is why I say that if you want to have a different reality than the default one, you need to find your way there with feeling. they're attracting and trying their hardest to make sure that everyone is a puppet and they have control of the strings, so if you want to do something other than react to what you observe, you have to take a different route: a route where you feel differently than what you're observing.

that's all there is to it, and it's continually what I'm doing, and is the reason why I'm getting so many vision upgrades. if I felt like they were in control, then I wouldn't be getting any. the very fact that I continue to feel better than what I'm observing should make me feel (in dream state or in reality), is evidence that I believe, or feel they have less and less control over my experience.

---

I dislike framing the emotional work in the frame of control, but there really is only two categories here: things I can control and things I cannot control. I cannot control anything anyone else is doing, and it's helpful to realise that it's all attraction, so somehow (doesn't matter really, but I did -- we all did) attract our circumstances, and so therefore because I have already attraced, and therefore cannot control the things people are saying or doing into my experince, the only thing I can control is how I feel now.

if I react to the those things, it will produce more of the same thing (or, you could say it'll get worse). however, if I actively choose to think and feel something different, something that feels better (not necessarily good), things will steadily improve, and if I keep noticing that improvement, eventually those things that are no longer a vibrational match to me, will leave my experience or transform into something that is a match to how I now feel, which is better[^1].

that's your basic funk formula, right there. once you get the hang of it, you'll feel invincble. my esperanza is that a good solid majority of people are capable of feeling that; it's truly the most wonderful feeling of freedom, and it's not that hard: you just have to *want* (desire) to feel better (or, you could try slogging through a crappy experience trying to focus on gratitude, lol -- I heard that works really well[^2]).

[1]: why? because the world you experience is a *reflection* of how you feel

[2]: I am joking of course, because gratitude is an absolute feeling, and trying to jump from frustrated, angry or depressed to gratitude is really hard. I much prefer relative feelings, as it's much easier to feel better than make a jump like that.


### 2020-06-20 21:37 - what's really happening

I finally figured out what's going on. once again they're trying to make an illusion. you see what's happening is -- you have to picture it from their point of view: I'm sure that more than 50% of their campany wants the manifestation of me with the girls to happen. therefore, in order to keep them busy, and look like there is progress happening, they repeatedly have them setup different things that are meant to be sabotaged. this keeps people placated as it appears that nosebook is attempting to do stuff to make it happen, all the while there is strong effort in order to sabotage the whole thing.

remember when I went to friendly harbor and holly was there and we were getting along quite well, when greg came and tried to get me to go home with him, but I wanted to stay? then after that a guy pretending to be on meth was trying to get my attention, then they said something to heather which made her feel really bad? all just because we were getting along so well? they never intend for anything to actually work out, but to just present the illusion that it's working out to the audience, because they know that if I have sex, I'll get connected, and they do not want that -- at least thee guys in charge of the thing sabotaging it, don't.

---

besides this, I am actually aligned with them on that aspect. I don't want to be doing anything until I get connected. I just don't feel like I'm quite capable of keeping things under control... control isn't the right word. I just don't feel like I have confidence that things can actually work out in a good way. I wake up right now a complete zombie, and it takes me definitely quite some time to get going. many parts of my body are not working properly, and I have all sorts of difficulties that are not otherwise necessary.

they do seem to be improving though, because remember when I first arrived here in pueblo in 2017, and I couldn't even walk up and down the stairs without holding on to the rail? I've come a long way honestly. I'm in a WAYY better place now than I was, and I'm continually seeing improvements all the time.

---

from here, there are two branches. one of the ways of looking at it is that if I were to get connected, then it's less of a continual improvment

I have given some thought to the idea I presented here: @[noseblog](2020-06-20 07:08) and I was thinking about it on the way home. since all I'm doing is just continually focusing on the improvement and letting the evolution of desire happen, it leaves a lot of time. so there really are two ways here:

1. I could just continue on as I have been doing my star-watching and stuff continuing to see improvements. I imagine that I'll continue to see notable improvements the whole time, and I was thinking, "ok, well maybe I can still do some sort of project with the girls even still" ... and I suppose I would just go the asexual route and we can create something together.

2. or, we can just plan on doing something, raise the funding ourselves and get something going.

---

in both options, both of them suppose that we set it up, and we get it going, instead of relying on nosebook to do it. I assure you they don't want it to happen, so waiting on them will be an endless task. instead, I think if we're going to do it, I really think we should set it up, fund it, and we should find the path to do it. that way, it would be our creation, and rememeber the one abe-now episode @[abe-now](2020-05-21) where they made the following quotes:

> «when you've given a lot of thought to something and you've been very careful and specific about it and you thought you'd done a good job of explaining it to the others around you -- and then you realise that you hadn't communicated to them what you really meant; they don't get you; they don't know what you mean, and they get off on a toot and they perform something that is in the exact opposite of what you would have done, __if you had of been in on it__ and it makes you feel nuts, and it makes you feel out of control?»

> «it's so normal to gravitate in the direction of your desire. that's why you have arguments with people. when they move in the direction of what you mean and what you want, __it is never appropriate to just give in to that__. it's much more appropriate for you to own what you want and speak what you want and explain what you want. there's nothing wrong with helping others understand your calibration process.»

> «never calibrate to something you don't want, even for the sake of finding harmony and friendship with them because it will bite you over and over and over again. be true to yourself and true to your vortex -- and when you're consistently there, others will understand where you're coming from.»

the sense that I was getting is that I'm definitely going to "want to be in on it" -- and since they must hide behind a shroud of secrecy and stuff so much so, that they can't actually have a conversation with me. instead, the only feedback I get are car sounds and loud birds, so it's not really an effective form of communication, so logically I have to rule out the possibility of "being in on it" meaning to be having any form of meaningful communication with them.

then, the part about what they said, when they said, "it's much more appropriate for you to own what you want and speak what you want and explain what you want". that's the thing, is I do want to own what I want. I don't wan to be just forced into some thing to placate their audience. I want to actually want it, and direct is too strong of a word, and so is control, but I want to feel like it's something I created. I suppose that's why I'm kinda holding on to this idea of finishing up a first version for so long, because I want to feel like I'm creating something instead of just doing something that someone else wants me to do.

most of all though, I want the girls in on it too. I don't want it o just be me or nosebook (mostly I don't want it to be nosebook) deciding what it is that should be done and trying to manipulate everything... it's hard to explain, this but I really hate sitting back and quite literally everyone knows more about what's happening than I do.

I'm gonna stop there.

---

what I was thinking though is that if we want to do this, I think we should set it up and get it going. I don't really know where to begin, either, and I know that trying to figure out everything in a short period of time feels stressful and undesirable to me, so what if we just did something like:

(this is just a draft concept, and I'll feel it more as it goes)

what if we planned for november/december or something in there to give some time to do proper funding and get things set up.. like maybe a kick starter type thing (actually that feels kinda bad) or something... maybe we only need a few private investors, or maybe we did our own crowd funding type thing where that investment translate directly into investment into the organisation. I don't know. I've given some thought already to the way I want to strucure the company as well, and I'll begin writing those as well, because I think we should do thing a bit more differently than normal start-ups do them. I want the girls to feel ownership in what they're contributing, and the model will be much more "flat" than the typical model. I'll explain more soon...


### 2020-06-22 13:53 - I don't want to try (too hard)

as I was thinking about writing this entry, I was thinking to myself, "trying to make this happen, feels to me like trying too hard" -- a squirrel came up really close to me. most of the time they keep quite a bit of distance from me, but this one was different. I took it as a bit of a sign of low-resistance. if what I was saying was high resistance, chippy wouldn't have come so nearby. so anyway.

what I was thinking about prior to that was simply that I sorta am just stuck. there's not a whole lot I can do, and if it doesn't happen, that's OK with me too.

I just simply don't feel very comfortable about anything. from my perpective, there are a number of things that, although they're improving, I just don't feel comfortable in my present situation.

this whole time, learning to watch stars and stuff, I've noticed that if I just learn that their pushing against is just more energy into the equation, soon I'm doing as well as I am now where vision upgrades are so effortless, they have to take such extreme measures as removing my consciousness, and even then I still get them. I'm stoppable, and that is thanks, in large part, to their pushing so hard against my vision upgrades.

if I try real hard to get vision upgrades, they don't happen either, so I've learned to just sorta go with their flow and work my way around in the conditions that I'm given. so, I'm just not going to try real hard at all. clearly, if I try to do anything, it gets stomped upon. so, really, I guess the message here is, I've kind of stated what I want previously, and until I get some inspiration on some action to take, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

the only way I know how to operate is what I called "the basic funk formula" -- which I've called releasing resistance, also. anyway, the basics of it are, continuing to, instead of reacting to whatever is happening, find a way to perceive the same thing in a better way, which feels better and better (less resistant), then, as I feel better and better, because I attract my reality, those who are not in harmony with my better feeling place will actually (from their perspective) appear as if I'm repelling them[^1] -- but I'm not, I'm just attracting new things more rapidly than the old things.

eventually, nosebook will either need to transform to become like my new vibraton, or they'll be "repelled". I'm not concerned how it works out, so I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

---

earlier today I was kinda thinking that my position should be with the girls that if they want it, they'll need to figure out how to get it, and also be ok with the difficulties I have right now, because I have everything I attempt do right now isn't working. I don't believe it's going to get better though, and probably only worse as nosebook keeps adding more and more energy into the equation by trying to prevent things from happening.

so I dunno what to think there, but for me personally, I'm going to stick with the basic funk formula for now, so excuse me if I seem uninterested or distant. my goal right now is lower my resistance right now. I doubt I'll even be programming my coputer here much as I don't really feel much like it (in fact, I hate it right now... there's nothing I like about it and nothing I want to be doing either). I'm hoping that I'll be able to gain a little more capability here as I stabilise, but I don't have great expectation really. I'm just going to do my own thing... everyone can just wait until I get stable and feeling comfortable. sorry, because I don't believe there's anything anyone can really do to help.

[1]: though, what's really happening is that everything is constantly in motion, and so when one is attracting something things faster than others, it appears like repulsion. I think this is how magnets work, and actually I think magnetic repulsion may have actually increased slightly if the earth is traveling through the galaxy at a faster speed, for the same reason.


### 2020-06-22 17:52 - ok, it's performance anxiety

so as I was trying to go to sleep (afer being way overslept), my mind was guided to a thought. ever wonder how it seems like I take a mental path sometimes through all sorts of weird thoughts, when they only have a loose connection beween the thoughts? well, I think that's nosebook guiding (steering) me toward the thougt that they want me to think about.

anyway, the subject this time was performance anxiety, and it's most likely in response to the previous entry where I said I don't feel comfortable. I thought briefly about it and rejected the idea that it's performance anxiety, because if I had performmance anxiety, I wouldn't insist on programming the things the way I wanted to program them -- instead, I would just pick a mainstream option like react or something and go with that. I don't have time for performance anxiety. I just go in the direction of what I believe in and give it my best effort. I can't do anything better than that.

also, if I had severe performance anxiety, my seemingly impossible time I'm having trying to actually make the code work, would really be bothering me a lot more than it is, if I had performance orientation -- or trying to pee, or my left-side's difficulty, or or or... the list is really quite long of things that I'm experiencing greatly underperform, and if they gave me anxiety, I would be completely dysfunctional. put any regular hotshot in my position, and the guy would have a total meltdown, I assure you.

---

but then after thinking about it, I think I'm going to change my answer to yes, it is performance anxiety. in this disconnected state, I am absolutely certain that I would drastically underprform what is expected of me, and I am certain that in order to meet those performance expectations, I must get/be connected first.

so I guess, I will instead say, maybe when you think of performance anxiety, you get anxiety becaue you don't believe you can meet the performance expectations. I don't get anxiety, because I don't have time for that; I'll always give it my best go, but I do believe that trying to get myself to perform in such a disconnected state feels unnecessary. it's sorta like crawling around in the dark and even though you have a flashlight in your hand, every time you turn it on, you get shocked (or someone takes the batteries away or something), and so it feels like silliness to be forced to fumble around in dark with a working flashlight with batteries in my hand.

I'll wait until I can figure out how to use the flashlight consistently first before going out into the dark. certainly anyone concerned with risk assessment and safety would understand that.


### 2020-06-24 13:46 - some more thoughts

so when I woke up this last time I was presented with a thought -- a few thoughts actually, but they go something like this. actually, I can't remember the initiation thougts at all now (likely because they were nosebook initiated), but the conclusion was:

I just don't think that adding girls into my present predicament is something that's wanted. although I'm improving, I don't consider my present state something that I want to add girls (more specifically sex) into.

next, if I think about what it is I want to transmit to the girls as the most important concept, it is to learn how to find a way to feel good no matter the situation. there is literally no better way that I could possibly do that in good feeling circumstances. if I said you have to find a way to feel good when things are easy and going well, my words, and that idea don't really carry much weight. however, if, like in this present situation, the girls don't have easy conditions to focus on or some easy way to feel good, then what I want to transmit is actually quite a bit more pertienent, so it's a good thing.

I'm fairly sure that there's no way that nosebook could ever change their mind about me getting connected, so that leaves the only option of finding ways to change perception of the situation until it feels good, then just notice the improvements as they come.

so, I figure, if there's no changing the physical reality, if we can continue on seeing only the improvement, then what will happen is more improvements. this is good for everyone. this gives the girls an opportunity to practice feeling good, and then as we continue on, the ones that do find a way to feel good will, either in their own timeline or in this one, find theirselves in a new situation where conditions have changed (I'm connceted and things are moving forward).

however, along the way, we can definitely try to do stuff. I'm hoping that I'm going to start getting more stable in my programming (and I will if I'm noticing the improvements), so it would be cool to begin building stuff in the meantime.

the counter argument to that is that if we're already doing stuff together, why not involve sex? well, like I said, I don't feel comfortable with it. it's a huge amount of (from my perspective right now uncontrollable) energy I don't want to add. I want to try and build some things that I've been meaning to build for a while now. there's no doubt that there won't be difficulty, but I'm certain that the projects will be profitable and eventually there will be a way[^1] to get connected. it may also happen that we might now even want to because we're so successful already[^2].

there's nothing to lose with this because the worst-case is that we're in the same situation we're at right now. the "best" case, we have a successful thing going and we can actually fund and do our own thing the way we want to do it.

I dunno, I'm just not worried about it. I can still feel some dissonance around the subject, so as I identify them, I'll make entries about different transformations of perceptions that could be beneficial to this.

---

lastly, I'm perfectly safe suggesting this idea, because there's nothing any of us can do about the nosebook thing. the only thing we can do is to find a way to feel good anyway, and it'll take as long as it needs to take, whatever that may be. oh well. in the process, we may all learn a rock-solid approach to only pereceiving imrovements, and if that is indeed the case, in my opinion, it's kind of an even bigger "fuck you" to them, because even without the conditions they're withholding/sabotaging, we're still successful and feeling good, while they've got all the good stuff, yet are still miserable and afraid.

[1]: it doesn't matter the way. we could be working on multiple ways at the same time, so the important thing is build up the resources to make it possible. perhaps one way would be sinthesising drugs, another would be an electrical system capable of changing how my head receives the signals. dunno..

[2]: in my experience, and I know it isn't like this at all, but I haen't seen too many business operations succeed when there's "love" involved (the only exception again being jerry and esther, but perhaps keyboard.io guys too, but I don't know them..)


### 2020-06-24 18:16 - why (resist not evil)?

in general, it seems there is some confusion as why I would just follow along with their idea that they want to ensure that I don't have sex or get connected.

in the basic of senses, I'm really tired of fighting. if there were a way to use my computer in a way that didn't get it shut down all of the time, I would do it. however, there isn't a way that I can affect what he does to my computer, so I just keep doing the best I can to go the way I want to go.

I'm well aware that it's just more energy so no problem there and the real success of any thing is not the physical evidence, but the emotional sense of how well you feel, so even if I never make any real progress on anything I'm trying to create on my computer, that's not the real success I'm looking for.

as a result, you'll notice that I just don't care so much anymore either to do my programming. if they don't want me to do that, that's fine, and quite simply, I'd rather just wait until I can actually use my computer in a productive way, than to try fighting it out.

I'll just go right along with their idea to keep my away from the girls. I just don't care. I want to be fourthcoming though. I don't want to live an illusion where I am pretending (or presented as) doing one thing, when in reality I'm doing another. for me it's much easier mentally if I'm just going the asexual route. they can present me to you guys however they think is best, but I'm not going to try and go for something that's always going to be sabotaged.

I'd rather spend my time working on things that are constantly improving, than to try and make something happen that they're completely against. I just don't care enough to try and make it happen and would rather it didn't, because if it did, then it woudld just be where I'm at, but worse. it doesn't feel like working in the direction of an improvement for me.

I guess it kinda has some similarity to the question in the abe-now broadcast (@[abe-now](2020-06-18)) about being forced to wear a mask and its final quote about resisting no evil, as well:

> This doctrine of "resist not evil" is the great metaphysical secret. To the world it sounds like moral suicide, the feeblest surrender to aggression; but in the light of the Jesus Christ revelation it is seen to be superb spiritual strategy. Antagonize any situation, and you give it power against yourself; offer mental non-resistance, and it crumbles away in front of you. -Emmet Fox

trying to push against what they don't want feels to me like a fruitless effort. perhaps it is "the feeblest surrender to aggression" -- but, I don't really have much choice. I only have the ability to transform my perception[^1] and notice that things are improving.

I don't know of a better way to explain it right now...

[1]: I'm going to be doing a whole lot more focus wheels here to show my mental process for all of you to see, as well.


### 2020-06-25 22:48 - let the success metric be an emotional metric

I'm writing this mainly for myself. I gave a longer version in a monologue yesterday, but when I'm talking the ideas flow through me and I have to pay attention to myself to actually get them. if I don't repeat them, or go back and relisten to my own concepts (I do this mentally because I don't have a tape recorder recording myself), I'll actually forget them because they're inspired (that means I am to some degree in an altered state), so they have very little staying power in the mind because they're foreign to everyday thought (very similar to how esther "channels" abraham, channeling an idea on drugs or in any inspiratve moment).

as a result, when I'm giving these sorts of inspired monologues, (unfortunately often when I'm in conversation with people) I want to pay attention to what I'm saying and retain it, so I do stuff like repeat myself while I'm talking to people until I get it :) I have a whole bunch of techniques that I use to retain these ideas in altered states, which is why you may wonder why I can still remember pot smoking sessions from over a year ago, yet I have difficulty remembering some people's names[^1]...

yes, I'm talking mainly to myself, not to them. I enjoy listening to what I have to say more than they do. this is actually why I appreciated so much my conversaion (arguments) with john michael, because in the process I said things and made new realisations on subjects I hadn't before made. this monologue was no different. I realised and had put words to, for the first time, some new things about my new state of non-resistance that I had not previously done.

---

abraham has said on a few occasion, that your "success" is how you feel, and that really resonated with me, because everything you're doing is to feel a certain way. think about it. even the most brutish of people are doing whatever they're doing to feel some sort of way -- usually superior in some way, to compensate for their own beliefs about theirselves as inferior.

so, *anything* that anyone is doing, the final result is *always* a feeling! it doesn't matter whatever the physical thing is, the end result is *always* a feeling. therefore, instead of measuring the success of any intention should not be measured physically, but emotionally: did it accomplish the feeling that you wanted it to accomplish?

most people are doing a whole lot of things, making a whole lot of action, but it's all for the purpose of making a feeling. all action (and thought/imagination, because they are the same -- see matt. 5:28) is to create a feeling. play a mental game for a moment and notice what your imaginaion would be like if what you imagined *didn't* produce a feeling[^2].

all desires that people have are built out of the opposite part (what you don't want to feel) so you know what it is that you do want to feel, even if you can't put words to it yet. later, the rational mind gets in there and introduces resistance to the desire by trying to figure out what is the physical version of that newly desired way to feel. we say, "oh, well, if I could have this, then I would feel like that" -- but it never does make you feel exactly like that, so every manifestation always has a slight bit of unwanted feeling in it -- *at first*.

---

let us not look at "timelines" briefly: you can imagine that there are infinite versions of you that all feel slightly different than you do right now, and so therefore are all living in a slightly different experience. that experience is an exact reflection of how they feel.

so, whenever you desire something, your inner being doesn't hear "words" -- it hears vibration. well, what is vibration? each thought you think creates a vibrational (emotional) reality all around you. you will notice that you can feel someone with really strong negative thoughs. they don't even need to speak words. it's present around them like an atmosphere. let's say someone is very depressed and even if they don't say anything, it's very evident. well, your perception is all about timing, so imagine a sine wave and your at 0°, the value is 0. at 90°, it's at the positive peak, at, 180°, back at 0, then finally at 270° it's at the negative peak.

your perception has more to do with timing, than it has to do with frequency because the frequency is determined by you -- and you sample the frequency at any time on that waveform. at the same time, your inner being is projecting the same waveform but at a different phase. so, if you're seeing the negative peak, and your inner being is seeing a positive peak, you will feel discord such as anger or depression. likewise, if you're perceiving something as a positive peak, and you're inner being does not perceive that same thing to be on your way to the way you really want to feel, your inner being will say be seeing the negative peak, while you're perceiving the positive peak -- so again, it'll feel like a lot of discord.

anyway, back to the person who is angry or depressed and their thoughts are creating this vibration (emotional) reality around them... their thoughts are tuning their perception to the part of the waveform which is 180° out of phase of what their inner being percieves, which is in the direction of feeling the way they really want to feel... so while they're focusing all of their attention on how awful things are, *at the same time* and *in the exact same waveform* is the opposite peak, the "other end of the stick" -- where all that person wants to feel is also being projected. however, because their perception is 180° out of phase, they're perceiving (feeling) the exact opposite of what they want to feel.

---

so, you will notice that while you are feeling awful, you are simultaneously creating what you want to feel (later physical details fill in), so you could say that the whole point of it all is to feel negative emotion... right? the more negative emotion you feel, the more good stuff you're creating, right?

it doesn't have to be that way. you don't need to experience negative emotion to create what you want. imagine a different scenario, where you're purchasing a computer and you're looking at the specs for the different models, and there are 3 models that each have something you want, but none of them have all three. well, when you look at those models, let's say that this time now, instead of seeing wanted when it's not necessarily wanted (180° out of phase), instead, you see wanted on some bits, but you're not going to take all of models that didn't have everything you want and set fire to them or feel really bad that the video card only has 1GB instead of 2GB (or whatever). these aren't end-of-the-world scenarios in your mind, so they're just "not as good as they could be" instead of "completely unwanted" -- so let's say then in these models which don't contain all wanted things are say 90° out of phase or so.

as long as you don't go and react in some negative way or feel depression that you're never going to be able to find the computer you want, you just take the feelings instead as indicators that perhaps you should wait for the model that does ring your bells or put your own compter together or something... point is, upon realising that those models weren't everything that you wanted, immediately, the vibrational model of the computer that feels exactly the way you want it to feel was created in that moment, and you're already on your way to get there. the "timeline" where you're picking up the computer that feels perfect to you exists and you only have to find a way to feel like you're picking up the computer that feels perfect to you.

---

therefore, if I completely take the physical bit out of it and go for the feeling, I'm actually getting to the manifestation that I want to have. ok, let's connect this back into reality, so it's easier to see:

if the same waveform is contains the peak wanted and the exact opposite of it, and both are happening at the same time, then all I have to do is to change my phase, so that is in alignment with the phase my inner being feels. one cannot take absolute positions on the waveform, because it's only how much out of phase it is... when you perceive wanted and it feels bad, your inner being doesn't perceive that as wanted in the sense that it's not on the way to getting to feel the way you want to feel. the opposite could be true too: you perceive unwanted, and your inner being sees that as the way toward feeling the way you want to feel, so finding a way to change your perception of it being unwanted, can allow you to move in the direction of feeling the way you want to feel[^3].

so, then, since both directions can feel bad (or good), one cannot perscribe absolute values to any (action/imagination/intention) or emotion. instead, they must be seen in relation with each other on a personal basis: the emotion in in which the action is performed, the way that the imagination makes you (really[^4]) feel. I then try to pick things that feel better. it's always a kind of trade-off in the sense that I'm trying to find things that feel little bits better, and avoid things that feel worse.

for example, I missed going out to watch stars a few days ago, and it made me really want to go to watch stars -- yet, however, if it's like raining outside or something, then I won't go. trying to fight the rain and make that happen doesn't feel like something I want to do.. similarly, I really want to make a computer program I've been working on, but if when I sit down it feels like a lot of effort and not something that interests me or something I really want to do (even though I know I really want to make it, if it doesn't feel like I really want to make it when I sit down, I just go do something else).

what I'm looking for is the way to find a way to getting to feel like I'm creating the thing I've always wanted to make, because that's where the manifestation I'm anticipating is located.

I'm not looking to try and make the girls thing happen. instead, what I'm looking for is to feel like the most wonderful thing is happening and it's even better than I could have even imagined, because that's where the manifestation we all want is located.

easy :)

[1]: actually, I used to use a technique where I would mentally associate a person and their name with labels of some sort, because I found I could get their name back easily if I remembered the label. almost always the label wasn't something I could say in english, and actually, now that I'm writing this, that may be why I have so much difficulty remmembering people's names: I think nosebook is hard at work trying to rearrange the associations in my brain so that they control it's train tracks (eg. one concept only can connect to certain other ones), so when I have undefinable concepts, their system probably makes me forget them or suppresses them in some way.

[2]: actually, I would imagine that the nosebook upgrades they gave to people in their imagininagion -- the real upgrade, although visual, the real upgrade in your imagination is that the resulting feeling from the imagination is stronger. this is the DMT they're forcing your brain to produce more of to make the imagination more vivid. you probably notice that your thought yields stronger emotion now too. the contrast is greater. long gone are the days of weak thoughts now thanks to nosebook.

[3]: I just got a weird reaction from someone about this concept in relation to nosebook. the concept goes something like, they're perceiving something (probably me getting connected) as something unwanted, but it's actually on the path to feel the way they want to feel. whatever.

[4]: I have noticed this one is a tricky one, because some things feel better than others but it's important to separate the action from the emotion. so, for example, in my imagination, hatred revenge and killing people can feel really good, but it's only because it's better than the feeling of depression -- and, if I think about killing people in any other emotion than pure powerlessness, it doesn't feel so good.. or, another example: sex and pleasure can feel good, but it's only becuase it feels better than boredom and lethargy, yet doesn't compare to a feeling of joy and pure extacy -- which then, if from there, you add in sex, see how much better the action of sex feels with extacy or joy than it does with lethargy or boredom.


### 2020-06-26 00:46 - opening up the eye

I was out star watching a little earlier, and I was noticing that the way I was focusing, it felt like an eye inside of my head was opening. it was a very strange feeling which I want to relate here.

imagine trying really hard to open your eye lid. for me, maybe afer I've been asleep for a while, it may feel sluggish to open, but certainly like it requires any effort. however, while fully awake (not tired), imagine what it would feel like if you needed to apply effort to open your eye. it's sort of counter-intuitive for me -- maybe like I need to apply effort to close them, actually.

well, it was sort of like that. when I was there focusing on the light, I noticed that if I put effort into trying to open the eye in my head or focus the light into the centre of my eye, it wouldn't work. instead it happened easily when I just allowed them to open.

then however, it felt like a suddenly a rush of energy, like as if I were staring directly at a very bright light trying to open my eyes -- perhaps even stronger than the sun it felt kinda like -- and then the eye wanted to close again. obviously, there was no bright light, and when that happened, I saw only blackness instead of any light, and the strong feeling of the light felt like it feels when trying to stare into the sun with both eyes at the same time. however, just like I have trained myself with the sun, I can imagine that sometime soon I may be able to open that eye and it will acustom itself enough that it doesn't automatically close from such a strong influx of energy/light.

---

I wanted to write this because there's a very great "secret" to understanding that opening this eye is like trying to put great effort into opening your eyes when you're already awake. it has more to do with letting your eyes adjust to the ambient brightness, then making effort to open them, cause in your awake state, they already want to be open.
