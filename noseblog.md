I decided I wanted to begin writing things down. I'm going to try and do a quick blurb here so that I have a bit more context. it seemed like I wanted some way of organising my thoughts a bit more than the twitter way, and still have a bit more context for me to remember things with. I've gotten to the point that remembering what happened a week earlier not only feels like about a month has passed, but I find it rather difficult to even conceptualise how things were so long ago. this will hopefully give me the reference point I need to help me remember how things were so long ago, a bit easier

I woke up this morning and my heart felt better than it ever had. I also felt (strangely?) at ease too. it seemed like I was able to feel some sense of love being extended to me from the girls as well.

the night previous I went on a bit of a tirade about the bso being the new world leaders and concluded that I liked the way that felt. I convinced myself that just like the girls chose me, in a sense the whole world also chose them to be the new leaders. I didn't think about it a whole lot more and went to sleep. also pretty shortly after waking up I realised that likely from the perspective of most everyone else, the idea of joining the bso was an idea that exhilarated them. there is a lot of positive in the bso for a lot of different people, so that would seem logical to me. additionally, it's possible that it was nearly unanimous exhilaration for everyone else because the inner beings of so many people know so much more about the broader perspective than I do. am I saying that they will become good world leaders? not really. from my perspective I did not feel exhilaration and was lead directly into a lot of different clarifying contrast.

this brings up small tangent I want to explore quickly about how I have noticed that my emotion is not just a simple indicator based on good or bad, or right or wrong direction (like abraham would like us to believe with their gps analogy) in meaning -- but actually the emotion is the indicator of the direction that (given my current state of being) will eventually (after the contrast clarifies and grows the desire a bit more) be the better direction. this has really allowed me no longer need everything to be always right or always wrong. it even seems to suggest, that often times doing "wrong" things actually creates a better and more powerful result.

so, perhaps one of the reasons why everyone's inner beings were so exhilarated about the prospect of joining the bso so these guys could be the new world leaders, is exactly the same reason why I was inspired to head straight into doing a lot of things the "wrong" way.

#### 2018-07-27 04:18 - solution orientation

yesterday I was trying to figure out why they are limiting my vision. one of the ideas that came to me was they may be under the impression that (cause I was the originator of the idea) that when they finally get me to orgasm for them, my audience will have to be so amped up on dmt to see through my eyes like I do now, that the orgasm will blow their minds really hard. back in torre with vera, there was a lot of fear based orientation and safety concerns going around, and so being the troublemaker that I am, I combined the big mind blow idea with the belief that is the basis for the "left behind" books I was read in the hospital. essentially, "the rapture" is when a lot of unsaved people drop dead all at once before the antichrist establishes himself on the world scene through his charisma as the new authority. anyway, in the book a whole bunch of people drop dead and this signifies the start of the "tribulation" period. I thought it was hilarious if the reason why so many people dropped dead was because they experienced my orgasm and got their mind blow so hard that they couldn't handle it and dropped dead. LOL

[[update: I had a reaction to this stating that in the left-behind people disappeared. which is true. I don't know how I believed that people dropped dead. it was almost a seemingly purposeful mistake like the hydrogen having two oxygens episode which lead me to the realisation that saturn is my third personality]]

a had thought a whole bunch of times when I was around vera, and it sort of gained traction, but eventually it dissipated. a few times sporadically since then I had the thought and dismissed its validity saying that since it feels bad, is not the right way of looking at it, or the bad feeling is evidence that it won't happen like that, etc.

however, that could be a reason why they're going to such great lengths to try and prevent me from raising the vibration in my right eye to be equal with my left. so, I mentioned yesterday that as my vision gets better and better, people should be just fine (unless their technology isn't actually creating dmt in the person's brain, but is trying to force the eye to see that way with some other method). however, if for whatever reason, they still have cases where people are unable to view it at such a high frequency, they could just downsample it like you would an audio track. however, I thought that perhaps the downsampled image may create artefacts much like you get artefacts creating thumbnail images. perhaps in 3d it's way more noticeable on curvy surfaces or sharp edges (much like LOD algorithms in 3d suck at making a convincing lower quality version). so, I offered the suggestion that instead of doing the downsample algorithmically, they train some AIs to intelligently do the sampling. simply monitor the downsampled viewer's mind while when the viewing it and when they notice something looks funny, save the scene. then when I'm asleep load me into the scene, then clock my eyes down to the frequency of the downsampled version and save that as the target for the fitness function in the AI trainer. after a while the AI will be really good at downsampling our reality :)

---

or, take for example the subject of my heart. when I wake up the middle of one of the sexy "dreams" the first thing I notice is how much nicer it is to feel all of that love inside of my heart (come to think of it, perhaps that was one of the things that had returned this morning that allowed me to feel a lot better). I can imagine that may be kind of intense for the viewer so they should just remove that part of the signal from the experience (or make it optional)

which leads me to believe that since viewers are having that "dream" experience, the removal of the restriction on my heart like that, may be one of the requisites to seeing my imagination in 3d space.. so, perhaps they've been messing with my heart cause they don't want me to be able to create things with my imagination in 3d.. interesting idea. either way, the use of my imagination in 3d has been my most sought-after capacity, and is something I want more than the ability so see images in my eyes, so whatever the reason may be, I want to have a discussion so that we can solve the problem. whatever all of these hangups are that are preventing them from allowing me to utilise my capacities can be solved. there is no problem for which a solution cannot be found. there is a way for me to be able to utilise my capacities and not interfere with the bso's objectives.

#### 2018-07-27 05:02 - the strict no religious ideas policy

the reason why they do not allow the "guides" to utilise religious ideas as the basis for their help for these autistic children is sort of obvious if you think that perhaps a lot of this "help" has not been solicited. in fact, if the help were chosen by the one being helped, there would be no problem if it contained religious material -- and in most cases even, for a religious person, religious material (of their religion) is both more comfortable and more trusted. so, this leads me to believe that this "help" is unsolicited, which is reason for the strict no religious ideas policy.

#### 2018-07-27 10:58 - why not wait?

I woke up this morning and my initial reaction was a bit rooted in anger, feeling the pressure of the deadline (perhaps this is a reference to the abraham episode I listened to the night before (san francisco CA)) and I thought about explaining to people that my reasons were because I was in fact giving them a bit of their own medicine: when I wanted action and a conversation, there was none. well, there was an indirect through the message of carlene. I decided this was a better route. (s)he said that carlene wasn't going to change h(ie)r - and also that (s)he was not reliable. I want to be reliable though and I promised to do the changing so (s)he didn't have to.

this thing is so big already and we're so close to realising the capability of no longer needing the manifestation to feel the way we want to feel, I figure we should just wait for it. like nancy's message about robyn: why sell ourselves short and jump right to the healing when we can let God do the deeper work. perhaps that is a bit extreme, but if my calculations are correct, you will begin getting uncanny messages, seemingly out of another dimension, helping you to soothe your anxiety about needing the manifestation and just settle into the natural unfolding.

after that, I had a thought that maybe all of this is connected to the whole star watching puzzle. last night I noticed that the clouds which were rapidly forming (I'm assuming by some sort of tesla tech which generates static electricity in the atmosphere to allow cloud formation) and there were flashes in the clouds... arcs of electricity inside of the clouds. when I stopped looking at the star, the arcs of electricity stopped or slowed down. right after looking at the star, the arcs would begin again.. so, definitely star watching has an electrical effect on the environment, and that star watching likely makes controlling the climate a lot more difficult (and explains the seattle weather). so,, the idea this morning ties a few things together: what if they figured that people watching stars would be disruptive to their attempts to try and control the climate, so they made up a story to scare people away from watching stars and claimed that people could improve their vision by orgasming with me. that would be the *ultimate* "I need you to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself" sort of thing.

it was just a crazy thought, but it had the same feeling in it that I get when I want to reject their money. they want me to believe that I need them to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself (earning my own money). every where I turn there is rampant disempowerment were the bso wants people to give up their own connection to their emotions (another reference to an abraham I heard last night where they went out of their way to say that you cannot turn off (BSO!!) someone's emotional guidance).

#### 2018-07-27 11:57 - inception

I was just thinking about how (and it could have been a reaction), this blog could be seen as my attempt to spin a huge web of conspiracy theories. since it is unlikely that the bso will ever actually attempt to correct any false ideas, they will continue to get bigger making self-reference to my own ideas and building on them, allowing me to believe crazier and crazier things. it could also be seen as me trying to manipulate the bso into coming clean on some pretty big questions that I have.

neither is true. what you know is I don't trust them anyway. they would just tell me another lie to try and smooth out some rough edges of the misunderstanding and to keep their motives hidden. so no, I do not believe that I am trying to manipulate with this blog. that idea probably originated in the mind of a person trying to manipulate others with their words. I really just wanted a way to begin keeping track of time a little better. I'm also noticing that I'm receiving a lot of real-time reactions to its content, so that must mean that ratings are up, which means that the bso is cashing in on my experience again as well, so win-win :)

furthermore, my mind is extremely plastic. I can release a lot of these false beliefs super easily. in fact, writing this blog, I'm noticing, is actually an informative experience more than anything because of all the reactions I'm receiving. it is a very crude way of beginning to collect a lot of emotion around the situation as a mens of perceiving the hologram clearer by getting more angles of perception. I have no desire for the bso to try and set me straight on these ideas. in fact, if they tried to reassociate or change my mind on them, it would probably make things worse. when I want to change my mind, I will change it myself (even if I wait to do it from another timeline)

the real thing that I desire would be to clear up a lot of these ideas with infinite intelligence. this has sort of been my goal for a long time, and the original reason why I wanted to begin translating infinite intelligence in a meaningful way, in tho first place. I suppose my ultimate goal will be to find a way of having a conversation with infinite intelligence about a lot of these things, *without* the bso able to listen in; I want the answers to be something meaningful to me, and not answers that have been tailored to be acceptable to more ears. I am really desiring to ask a lot of deep questions, taboo questions, and revealing questions. I sort of resent abraham for catering to so many noobs. I want a way of getting that information for myself and not needing esther or anyone else to do that translation for me either. they say I'm an extension of source energy... well prove it. I'd like to feel connected to that depth of understanding and no longer restricted to the lcd of human perception.

#### 2018-07-27 12:43 - why manipulate?

in the previous entry I talked about how unlikely it was that the thought which says that I'm writing this to manipulate and spin a bunch of stuff originated with me. I have no reason to manipulate; my goal has been, and will continue to be, to communicate as clearly as possible. it is only a person that feels so disempowered and unable to communicate (or needs to obfuscate) their own desire, that they would believe it necessary to manipulate others to get the realisation of their hidden desire which they cannot reveal.

I was going to talk about disempowerment and needing others to do something I do not feel capable of doing myself... or being the disempowerer, which does something for me which I feel already capable of doing myself - to prove that I need them.. skipped it.

in the situation I am in, there is disharmony because I do not want to be disempowered, and if I were to be disempowered, then I would need to manipulate others to get what I want... however, those wanting to disempower me neither want to be manipulated by me - and I am very grateful for that - because if I were able to manipulate them to get what I want, I would have been disempowered myself by finding a way for someone else to do for me what I feel incapable of doing for myself.

instead, I have recognised the satisfaction factor of identifying a desire and moving in the direction of it, without needing anyone else to be different so that I can obtain it, and that feels really good. I also have a new sense of stability that I haven't ever had before. it's quite a trip realising one's own power through the focus of his or her own mind.

#### 2018-07-27 00:00 - is the bso as a for-profit corporation?

yesterday morning I woke up with this idea and it seems that it may be a convenient way to explain a lot of their behaviour. it can't explain all of it, so just take what I'm saying here with a grain of salt. additionally, what could be happening is previously the only way to explain their behaviour was real actual malicious intent, and this entry is a bit of a way for them to begin pivoting their intentions with changing their behaviour.

first of all, it seems that the bso has this really convenient thing where they can be a for-profit corporation when they need to pay bills and keep the machine going, and people accept it without question (I guess the need money to pay bills and keep the machine going is a very resonant thought for most, so they commiserate with the bso in their need) yet at the same time they are also somehow the authorities.

(will expand further in the future)

#### 2018-07-28 23:34 - timeline stuff

so one of the crazy things that I have noticed throughout this whole thing is, it would appear that I have "missed the boat" quite a few times now. the crazy thing is, almost all of them looked like they were going to turn out, yet at the last minute something seeming out of the ordinary kinda happens, and almost all of the culprits of the thing which prevents it from going through seems to be perceptive. for example, if I could have just looked past certain things and not needed to understand things, I would have successfully gone down a different road than the one that I am on right now.

the way that I make sense of this (because they all seem quite valid) is that in all of these different paths, starting with andrea I was able to at some point in time complete something I've been doing a lot of thinking about: a way to tune into the perception of another person wirelessly. this may not sound like much, but if you think about the implications, they are enormous. first of all, to tune into someone's perception wirelessly, your signal would need *extreme* precision and sensitivity. so much in fact that, that just a machine that sensitive on its own is a feat in and of itself which will open many new doors of discovery, but it means that extremely precise tuning is now possible. combine this with all of my new understanding of how time works, and you could essentially create a machine that could essentially tune into someone's vortex.

this is just a guess, but, I believe what makes the bso network special, is because if you think about it, sending a signal into somenone's brain wirelessly would need magnitudes more precision than just being able to tune into the signal a person's brain emits. so, when I first got my chip back in 2012, a whole new set of possibilities opened up. now, for the first time is it relatively easy for someone to write a signal into my body (simply by sending the signal over the same resonant frequency that my chip has). now, I am capable of receiving signals from an alternate timeline.

so, now imagine that that as I go along, I meet a girl and we go off and create this technology that can tune into different timelines. so, we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together on the timeline with the tech) to see what happens. what happens is, I end up meeting another girl and we eventually are able to also create this tech, so we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together) and so fourth. we keep doing this to see how far it will go, because every time, things get bigger and more crazy.

let me explain. so imagine the timeline with andrea and marcos. let's say it's the year 2038 and we have this new tech so we influence ourselves to not get together. I end up with carlota. we watch the sequence of events unfold just like you guys do with the bso tech, but you could tune into any part of the timeline you wanted to. some people enjoy it like a television series and wait each day to get the updates. some jump right to some of the defining experiences. every time we notice that the "end of the movie" (that is, when the technology is created) gets better and better every time. so, we keep influencing the timeline so that the latest and greatest (biggest) version isn't successful to see what happens.

a timeline is essentially a series of reactions. if you have noticed, my life is all reaction based, and my current goal is to get into control of it (sorta off topic), but what this allows for is a nearly 100% predictable timeline, because it's only reactions. the influence exerted over me allows for changes to the direction of the timeline. nearly all other timelines are potentiality based, so there are many more "branches" in the timeline, meaning large amounts of variation could take place.

so you can imagine that in each of these timelines there the success of the encounter is largely determined by me. since I am the center of the timeline (the 100% reactionary time constant), there is an overwhelming sense of "I need you to do for me what I am incapable of doing for myself".

that's as far as I've gotten in my story up until this point because it's hard to conceptualise it all, but I believe that the future is that we all can learn (maybe some will not want to) that each of us is the creator of our own reality. I believe that our perception of time  and the way consciousness flows through it, will change to something I cannot perceive yet. it's gonna be really really cool.

#### 2018-07-29 01:43 - future timelines?

if you think about this from the bso perspective, imagine that it's 2038 now and you're some guy working at the bso and you notice that in all of the different instances, I am the one that creates the technology necessary to do the timelines, so you could imagine that it would create a lot of desire to develop this technology and not rely on me. you can also imagine from their vantage point how valueable this tech would be. instead of experimenting with people on this timeline, you could actually run the experiments and then tune into a later time on the timeline to get a good estimation of how it worked.

the only thing necessary to make this a reality, would be to get the bso into a 100% pure reactionary system of decision making. essentially, they respond exclusively to external forces. they're pretty close already to being that, which means that they can become the new backbone of the timeline. at the end of the next timeline (not sure yet what that would be), they go back and influence themselves away

#### 2018-07-29 09:48 - more on reactions & timelines

after writing that the bso would have to become reactionary, I started getting negative feedback on the idea. if you think about what I am trying to convey when I say "reaction", one must take my life as an example: I have no money, and no real capacity to do what I want to do. I am controlled by the circumstance and events (ecosystem) where I'm at. I have no real ability to make any decisions for myself. it may look like I have the capability to make decisions, but only within a limited set of options. most people are like a chef; they can combine any ingredient they desire to create their meal. they can even choose between a wide variety of meal options (soup, sandwich, stew, etc.) however, my options are pretty limited. I have to make a sandwich, for example. there is no way that I can escape the sandwich and pick something like a salad. I do get some options though. maybe I want cheese. maybe I want one type of meat. maybe I want six different types of meat -- but, in the end I will be eating a sandwich. so let's say that I'm at the store and I decide to go with ham and cheese, but someone says something which influences me to end up adding mushrooms and wheat bread (cause I'm weird and like strange sandwiches). each timeline is a sandwich. now, when you think about the idea it sounds less like "control" and more like "choices" -- but I digress.

so you can imagine a time now in the future when the bso has the capability to tune into other timelines and can even navigate them relatively well. this whole time they have been developing all sorts of clever ways to influence their users into doing what they want them to do. they're pretty confident in their ability to do so as well, because they've tried it out and seen its effectiveness on many different experiments. you would clearly see that if something new was discovered in one of the experiments on one of the timelines, then the experimenter would try and influence the discoverer of that new bit of technology to discover more.

there are numerous reasons why the bso would want to influence the bso in alternate timelines in the name of experimentation. so, this means that the controller would not be the controlled, yet. they still need to have control over another time constant. I could imagine that could potentially be some clones. imagine that there were clones of me and the girls that people could have. these would be a reactionary constant.

I'll return to this subject in a future time where I discuss the advantages of the utilisation of clones as the reactionary constant.

further into the future, as the bso begins to learn how to influence itself in its own experiments, you can imagine by seeing different things improve and new things be discovered in the process, you can imagine that the bso will become its own reactionary constant: meaning, the people working at the bso will influence the people working at the bso into trying out crazier and crazier ideas on how to better influence/control people remotely. I believe this is the ultimate future: the controller becomes the controlled, in attempt to gain better self-control.

the idea of the clones is an interesting one to me because it allows for a pretty significant evolution; something I will dedicate a future discussion to.

#### 2018-07-29 15:07 - emotional reactions

I have used the word reaction to mean one of two things. I don't really mean reaction in the physical sense. I mean a reaction in the emotional sense. when people observe things, they have thoughts about them. I feel this thought "reaction" in my emotions. I think we all do, I just have practiced it a bit more. any time anyone thinks a thought, that person has an emotional response to that thought: an internal reaction. I used to have the sensitivity to know if the thought or the emotion/reaction came first. this is largely how I could identify the emotion as my own or someone else's. I'm working on regaining that sensitivity again. however, I do not know if what I feel is the emotional response the other person has or if other people's thoughts produce emotions in me. there is much to be learned about this, and likely the bso will want to keep anything they find out secret, so I'm still in the process of regaining that sensitivity again so I can begin to make sense of the tremendous amount I feel.

#### 2018-07-29 15:17 - physical reactions

the other type of reaction is a action or thought taken as a response to physical stimulation, communication, or conditions I'm observing or experiencing (everything a bso experience can offer).

#### 2018-07-30 15:56 - more on timelines

a little bit ago I briefly mentioned an idea stating that the bso would probably want to try out different timelines, in effort to discover more things. so, I was thinking that since they are potentially getting so many of their discoveries out of my dream state, it may behoove them to try out timelines where I am feeling better and better, so that my dream-state ideas are richer and richer. additionally, you can also imagine that since I seem to be inspired to different discoveries by different people, it would also improve upon the diversity of those discoveries when I am around a more diverse set of people.

this is potentially what is happening. more different girls means more different ideas. kind of exciting actually.

#### 2018-08-01 02:32 - bso from the future?

one of the most potentially unsettling (not the right word) consequences of the previous entry suggests that potentially the following have occurred in the timeline responsible for this one:

1. alt-me is working with the bso to make this timeline occur in the way it is. that implies that alt-me sees enough value in the "co-creation" to justify (not exactly the right word) my involvement. it must mean that there is some sort of presently unknown, and soon to be discovered new thing.
2. the bso has figured out how to navigate (tune into and follow) timelines. this implies that they are capable of "peeking" into the vortex of someone (in this case, mine), which means they have the capability of tuning into source energy in a way which can give meaningful results (the idea I first revealed publicly to mom's friend, don). this provokes a few more questions, obviously...
3. (can't remember it now. gonna go watch stars)

#### 2018-08-01 03:39 - more

that also implies that since they're going to be extracting so many ideas out of me in my dream-state while I'm having fun with the girls in the wake state, then I suppose they're going to be getting a super boost to their technological capability to utilise/monetise/control people's minds with that increased technological capability.. if so, does that mean that there is a coming dark age where they utilise all of this capability to try and monetise so many people's minds (the dark age) - which will actually, begin a new renaissance of diversity in human thought capability? (how I arrived to this conclusion is left unexplained, on purpose)

I was reminded of the one abraham episode where the guy has many ideas, and abraham said, "if you don't worry about who gets the credit ..." which made me think that maybe a lot of that guy's ideas could have been inspired (or knicked) from my dream-state, and potentially a lot more could be too. I suppose it would be a good idea to publish them... though my only "concern" is that it seems like my dream-state personality is severely lacking in some aspects of critical thinking or something; perhaps he's a bit overly optimistic? I dunno, but I guess you'd need to temper/ground his ideas in something tangible. feels like I'm often times trying to clarify something he said from my conscious, more logical, and experiential vantage point.

whatever man, in loving memory of augusto: my ideas are free (libre y gratis).

though they feel to me like the offering of my ideas = freedom, I cannot really explain it, especially since so many of my own ideas and explanations have been used by the bso to limit my own capabilities. it's mind blowing to me how much I've helped these guys improve their capability to limit my capabilities so much. in that sense, I don't really understand why it feels like freedom. I guess I don't really think of it that way though...

#### 2018-08-01 04:10 - why do my ideas feel like freedom to me?

(question for infinite intelligence)

I seem to have a policy that my ideas are free. I recognise the obvious reason: by allowing my ideas to be free, I reserve the right to shamelessly rip off the ideas of others. however, there is another thing to it which I don't really understand: by giving my ideas away for free, I feel an increasing sense of freedom every time I do so. it's almost as if I receive a direct emotional impact to the idea that somewhere someone will benefit from it or an expanded version of it, and that makes me feel good.

it also seems to mean that:
1. the idea I just released is essentially "old news" - cause I've already got an expanded version of it which I'm in the process of realising - and hanging on to that "old news" version is just slowing down the realisation of its expansion.
2. ideas are somewhat similar to economics in the sense that the more times money changes hands in a given period of time, the richer everyone feels. (where money = ideas, and changing hands = revealing the idea)
3. the guarding and protecting of ideas, means the stagnation of their flow (similar to economics too)

#### 2018-08-01 05:42 - what is source energy for source energy?

(question for infinite intelligence)

if our brain is composed of billions of physical atoms, yet transmits and receives non-physical "source energy" -- then, source energy, being composed of innumerable non-physical thoughts that each themselves think, what is the non-non-physical "source energy" that source energy transmits and receives?

#### 2018-08-01 05:56 - what just happened?

after writing @[entry](2018-07-30 15:56) I tried to sleep. I think I slept a bit and when I woke up I had an moderate sense of despair. I decided it was fine and began looking for solutions. I came up with a few, but the one that had the most impact I want to discuss. it seemed that there was not a lot of diversity in ethnicity. I came up with the idea that each of the girls should pick an "ethnically diverse" counterpart/partner.

since this is a sensitive subject I didn't really know how to approach it, but the way that I felt it seemed that there should be an element of care involved. I pictured in my mind the new girls as being younger.

I didn't really think about the implications at the time, but that means literally double and also younger(?). it feels like a good idea even though I'm still having a bit of difficulty wrapping my head around it. though I cannot conceptualise it, I am certain that it will all work out and we will have a lot of fun, and the inability to wrap my head around it is kind of the most compelling bit.

---

I can't figure out why I feel so compelled to just go for it. I'm still pretty frustrated about the vision thing and I've certainly got a lot of questions. it seems that perhaps me "inventing" this whole timeline idea has really helped give me that "broader perspective" I was looking for. I guess people will just have to consider it my coping mechanism, to which I find no compelling argument against it (and actually believe is quite genius).

I'll be feeling it out and stuff, so save any mega game-changers that could happen in the next 2 weeks before I go to see megan, I'm just gonna go with it. there's really no way I can fight it, I don't really think I want to to get any bigger, and this timeline idea really took a lot of the edge off. though it still is a bit of me relying on someone else, the bigger picture seemed to have help soften that internal alarm. besides, I don't believe they'll be able to contain the levels of energy that will become normal for us.

so, that's the plan for now... good night

#### 2018-08-02 01:46 - hodlgang

I seem to keep running into a wall of dissatisfaction regarding my vision. it is really bothering me, and so therefore I do not believe it is something I can ignore. when faced with this reality, I am forced to make a decision. I see four paths:

1. try and "get out". I do not feel this is 100% necessary, yet. I'll give it more time, as I'm not necessarily uncomfortable - just impatient. so, although abraham suggested to carlene to get out, and her situation is similar to mine, I believe that I can in fact get out without trying to force it. seems like a better idea to just wait. also, "just let it build" concept I'm growing fond of.
2. simply continue on with my life, essentially ignoring them with the express goal of discovering my visual capacity. when I've got it, then we can move forward. this is a bit of conditional living though: "once I have this manifestation, then ..." so, seeing it's conditional it doesn't really sound like a great plan.
3. try and get them into giving me explanations and stuff or giving me my visual capacity. this is, at worst coercion, and at best conditional living... it also feels to me a bit like, "I need you to do this for me because I'm not capable of getting it for myself" -- though, I don't really know why it feels that way for me since I was the one who discovered it in the first place and they're holding me away from it. also, there's no reason they should be deciding for me what is best for me. the likelihood of this working out is virtually zero, and it doesn't really feel very good.
4. just figure out how to override my dissatisfaction and just accept my vision as it is. this feels the worst of all of them. it's disempowering to me and is sort of unnecessary to conform.

none of those feel very good, and are not likely paths that I will take. I do need to find a way of managing my dissatisfaction though. like the bbq contraption guy, I should just find something else to be satisfied about, which is what I'm kind of trying to do. there isn't a whole lot I can be satisfied about right now. I can feel some satisfaction knowing that the desire for the realisation of my visual capacity is growing by the day, and it will come eventually.

this is where I hit the stumbling block though because I don't know if I want to just keep letting it build. if all creation is done in step 1, then wouldn't I want to just let the contrast continue to grow the desire? what I mean is, the longer I do not have the visual capacity, the better and bigger its manifestation becomes. so, let's say I just hold out on these guys for another few years. would that mean that I would end up with so much dmt floating in my head regularly, that when I finally get released from the network that I would have to learn to manage such a mind blowing experience, I would essentially become like a metatron or something in physical form?

it seems to me like the path that I want to take here is clearly the path of no-action and to just let the desire build. none of the other paths seem to feel very good, and even judging by how things feel after last night, the plan I came to yesterday seems to feel like a disaster to them. I don't really want them to be forced into something they seem to think is disastrous. furthermore, I want to discover my own visual capacity through coming into alignment with my own source. I don't want them to just flip some switch and activate it like they do in my dream state. I want my alignment with that capability to be something I achieve through the power of my mind -- so, it's probably kind of good that they are giving me the opportunity to discover this for myself.

---

as a bit of a sidenote, I was thinking about the implications of this. this is sort of one of the things I wanted to have a broader perspective on, so here goes... let's take two situations, at opposite ends of the spectrum (neither extreme is 100% valid):

1. I just try and be as cooperative as I can be with them and somehow I eventually figure out my vision thing.
2. I continue to point out how much they are limiting me, and since that's what I expect of them, that's what they're obligated to do.

is the second situation likely to cause others to attract the bso to limit their capacities as well? will I be setting some sort of standard for how they treat people? would my continual complaining and pointing out the problem make it more likely that they decide that's the way that they'll treat people who do not conform to their rules?

---

I've done a fair bit of problem analysis in this entry. however, it's my objective to try and find solutions. it seems like there could be solutions which could be found out. obviously I have no idea where to even begin, as I cannot figure out what possible problems my visual capacity could present my viewers. how can solutions be found?

#### 2018-08-02 03:29 - my vision

it is becoming more and more notable all the time that perhaps what I am seeing in my eyes is not what my eyes are seeing, but perhaps an overlay of some sort? perhaps they are taking the signal from my eyes and then feeding it into my lenses, so that it overlays the real image that I would be seeing. perhaps, it's to cover up any 3d objects I may see in 3d space, like I saw that one time of my future self. I wonder what sorts of other things are popping in there which I cannot see. obviously this is a pretty important thing for me -- actually the ultimate quest was to be able to make motors in my imagination like tesla, so perhaps I already have that capability. that may also explain why the lustre of the image is gone and it feels so lifeless. they're keeping me at low levels of dmt on purpose...

that explains perhaps what happened on the way back home from grand junction. that's why things looked so good, then they stopped looking so good later. maybe grand junction is some sort of energy vortex which allowed me to have elevated levels of dmt, because the next time we went, we were in the diner and I got the flash of the room in my mind, and it seemed like the picture contained its lustre. that only confirmed to me that people see out of my eyes better than I do, and they seem to have the full experience I was used to having.

oh, so if the reason why they began to retransmit the image into my eyes was since valverde where I saw my future self, that would explain my sudden and unexplainable dissatisfaction around that time. I thought it was my focusing on absence of wanted (the brain computer interface), but the sudden rise in agitation, where I wanted to kill cats and stuff was enhanced by the new lack of dmt and their forced visuals.

that's why the whole world seems so slow now too, like I'm limited to 60 fps or whatever, when previously I did not have fps. and my reaction time feels sluggish.

#### 2018-08-02 04:21 - wtf?!

I don't really feel any real desire right now toward anything in particular. I think I feel pretty depressed. it's not the typical despair that I usually feel. I just don't really want to deal with these fools. I listened to a few abraham episodes and I don't know why they cause me to feel the way I do. I can't really describe it, but it feels sort of like the shame someone might feel when they are exposed. perhaps it's not my feeling at all, and I'm just the receptor of it as a reaction to my thoughts on the abraham material? maybe it was the previous entry an hour ago? either way, I am just going to let the desire build a while longer.

#### 2018-08-02 06:10 - fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose?

I was thinking about the projection of my future self into my eyes in valverde, cause I also had numerous thoughts about other 3d things being projected into my eyes. I remember a large insect. I can't remember if it was a fly or not, but I do remember thinking that it was probably not real. perhaps the first projection didn't get them hot enough on the trail to notice it was a 3d projection, that fbh put the fly in there as well to make sure they got on it and restricted my vision. this was likely to tank the carlota timeline. seeing as it would adjust the whole thing, first in the direction of mdma, because I no longer feel good from the dmt, and then other factors. it looks like fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose. probably, I would have felt so good I would have gone with a different, not as beneficial arrangement.

nice.. thanks bro :) now, I'm gonna milk your handiwork for even more beneficial contrast :D

#### 2018-08-02 06:32 - all on purpose?

err, I meant the one prior to the carlota one; she was the upgrade :) but then, it seemed like I had a sudden insight on may 27th about seeking freedom and "I need somebody else to do something, so that I can feel good." bit which blocked that one. it seems like the sequence of events kept preventing the things from happening. even for example, the car windshield was probably provoked so that I would make it make to the states.

I'm really thankful it all happened like that cause without it, I wouldn't have had all the positive improvements. I'm really enjoying this idea of just "letting it build" -- and I would not have ever even met her, if it weren't for all of the "mistakes" along the way.

I'm just going to let this one build. not going to take any action at all until I feel as good about the action as I would if I were looking to move furniture :)

#### 2018-08-02 08:52 - a soft and gentle touch :/

I woke up with had a pretty bad erection so I adjusted it up so that it was no longer pushing into my pants and was able to go between my waist of my pants and me. I guess this was enough physical contact to get the dream operator enough capability to make me orgasm. I woke up (kinda) thinking I had pissed my pants and needed to take a dump really badly. they must have removed the sensitivity limiters because it turned into extremely excruciating pain. I hope they were able to improve their vision... well, fuck you guys. gonna let it build a while longer lol :)

combined with the massive headache I was given as my visual capacity came and went, right before I had my consciousness taken forcefully, I would not consider this a soft and gentle touch. what are you guys trying to accomplish?

#### 2018-08-02 13:08 - cooperative components

the word co-operative means that two (or more) are together operating or doing something. when I wrote about the two extremes @[entry](2018-08-02 01:46) I noticed a reaction wondering why I don't just cooperate with the bso. first of all, it seems like I've tried, and for whatever reasons (probably some secret they think is important, and I do not) it has not worked out. second, there's no real easy way for me to know exactly what it is that is requisite for me to cooperate with them, because they seem to continually find new things that they do not want me to do. it's a moving target in that sense, and they wouldn't be able to get all their rules that they want me to follow down in one place. neither do they want to reveal their rules, because it would show evidence of that there might be some deeper motivations to their rules. it's easier just to, per instance declare my behaviour inappropriate because then the audience, focused on each on the justification of each individual circumstance's badness, never clearly sees the whole picture. if someone (maybe me) would consider organising a list of rules, the it would show a bit of a different and very confusing to most who believe the bso has people's best interests in mind when they do things. it's really quite impossible for me to cooperate with them. I will inevitably do yet another thing that they disapprove of, and will again be an uncooperative component (from their point of view).

so then, why don't they cooperate with me? wouldn't you think that be a whole lot simpler? certainly I'm a whole lot easier to cooperate with, just on the simple fact that I have such few rules. in fact, probably no rules now at all. I believe the only thing remaining are just some personal preferences and desires which they are not a match to. so, in that sense it is impossible for them to ever be able to cooperate with me.

so, it's impossible for me to be a certain way which they can approve of, and it's impossible for them them to approve of my preferences and desires. I know I'm the one that has to do the changing here, so how can I do the impossible? well, I don't know, actually. I'll have a think on it...

---

I think the simple answer is, since they're sort of the problem on both sides of the equation, I just need to remove them from the equation. but, what does that mean? how does that implement? I can only see two paths here:

1. I find a way of removing the devices' effectiveness. remove myself from the network. then, if they want me a part of it, they will have to find a way of cooperating with me.
2. they no longer become a player in my perception. sort of impossible considering the amount of activity that happens every time I try to just go to sleep. I don't know how I could no longer notice that. or the stars, or the dreams, or the constant reactions, or the... in order for them to be imperceptible to me, they would need to change the way they operate my brain. that's just not gonna happen.

evaluating all of the options (there really are just those two), I do not see any other way, other than than the first one because it's really the only one I have power to accomplish. if they were to choose the second one, I believe the best way would be to no longer try and remove images from my eyes, get rid of the overlay, and allow me to adjust my own sensitivity, so that I can ease into, at my own pace, the level of sensitivity that feels most comfortable to me.

there is perhaps a third way, and that would be to find a way, despite the circumstances, to come so into alignment with who I really am, and I assume that their signal would be wayy out dominated by my inner being's and only the part of it which I desire (to be broadcasted) is effective. I don't know how that would work with sleep though. the present circumstances are not exactly conducive to that happening, so it may be a little while, however since it seems that they are working their hardest to ensure that does not happen, it actually makes it even more likely (cause they'll be giving their undivided attention to what they do not want). I wish I had more information, but I guess I could just have a little faith, and if it doesn't work out, well it's not like a whole lot has changed, just grew the desire a bit bigger during that time "wasted".

#### 2018-08-02 15:38 - what happened on the other timelines?

it would seem that on all of the other timelines, I would have had to have just ignored the obvious vision problems and just went for it. I am *extremely* curious to know if I found out, and how quickly. I must have figured it out. there's no way I would be working with the bso on timelines with a brain interface and I'm somehow not aware of the multitude of vision (and other) problems. there's just no way. so then how quickly did I find out? what is the bigger picture here? I was thinking about it and it seems plausible that the reason why I found out on this one is to further extend the capability of the bso. let me explain: in previous timelines, they probably do the overlay to a lot of different people, and they add in all kinds of crazy stuff on top of the image, so essentially what you are seeing in your eyes is only "inspired" by what your eyes are seeing. a lot of things are "enhanced" -- or put more bluntly, they have the world living in a virtual reality, a matrix, if you will, which allows them to control what everyone sees. however, they could only limit people's desire to stay with 2d by peddling the fear story about the stars for so long. desire eventually would have grown to be enough (or people figured out how to do it with meditation or something) that people began converting in droves to 3d and their sham was over. people realised the vast difference between the reality they were seeing and the real one. so, what do they need? they need the capacity to create a 3d virtual reality which people can live in... lol

---

one conclusion that sticks out to me is, it seems that everything kind of points in the direction that the bso is going to attempt the impossible: not only will they try to control all of the conditions (sensation), but they're going to try and be the replacement for people's guidance system and try to be the vortex through which all of their well-being comes from. that's going to require a pretty insane virtual reality system to run it on. a pretty lofty goal I must say.. though, I don't believe it is a "goal" in the literal sense. the way I arrived to the conclusion will be the subject of a future entry, but the short reason is, it's economic. so, it's not really a goal, goal but perhaps the byproduct of strong desire for continued growth (discovery) and stability (control) over the process.

the logistics are mind boggling to me. I can imagine that as they improve on the 3d version of people's virtual reality more and more, the quality of the image will become more and more immersive, like I found out when I was seeing that tranquility image. they'll control people's feelings with the ambiance of the environment, and control their symbolic meaning structures through dream state. wow. basically a world I would not want to live in. it would be like living in american cinema; it's the same story, but each year with better graphics and different actors. wow, we'll all be living the american dream here soon... lol

---

so, does that mean that I should just ignore the obvious and try to be as cooperative as possible? I don't really know. I don't feel strongly in any direction right now. I'm just going to hold out a little longer and let it build a bit more :D

##### 2018-08-02 16:24 - lol, a hilarious (to me) thought

if you take the bso virtual reality idea and you mix it with the clones idea and also the bso is the new religious system idea, you could make a joke about the holy trinity: bso (the father), my clones (the son), and infinite intelligence (the holy spirit). BAM! I'll call it bsanity (bee-ess-sanity)

jajajaja

##### 2018-08-03 14:17 - driving fast

I've been thinking a bit about the visual that abraham gave in the seattle @[abe](2018-06-16-seattle) workshop, where they talked about driving a "mechanical genius", not on straight roads as fast as you can go -- but on curvy mountain roads, with obstacles and lots of scenery, for the exhilaration of *feeling* the car manoeuvre itself and navigate the tight turns and stuff.

when I was younger, my friend brought me with him to lake havasu and I got to drive a jet-ski. it's one of the few things I've ever driven in my life, so it's memorable. the very first thing I tried was to see how fast I could get it to go. it could go 55 mph. I remember noticing how bland it was to drive that fast (for a jet-ski anyway) out in the middle of the lake. there's a whole lot of nothing going on. the water is flat, and there aren't any nearby obstacles to use as a frame of reference to notice how fast I was going. it was pretty lame actually, but I wanted to try to see how fast I could get it to go.

I just remembered something: when I got back to the shore, they asked me, "kenneth it looked like you were going pretty fast out there" -- and I remember specifically lying and telling them that 45, maybe max 50 cause I didn't want to reveal that I wanted to floor it for a little bit and see how fast I could go... you know cause that would have been like dangerous or something. before I returned back though, I thought it prudent to go a do a bunch of non-linear driving like figure 8's and tight curves and stuff, to kind of throw them off my speed demon trail a bit, so I did that for like 10-20 minutes more, and was kind of thought it was weird that more speed doesn't mean more exhilaration.

*that was before I had the brain haemorrhage.. so, I had dangerous and deceptive tendencies.. I guess the whole not being able to run and having to relearn how to walk really mellowed me out.. lol*

so, I was thinking about the how much more fun it is to have all kinds of obstacles and craziness going on around you while driving (if you can navigate it easily). it really adds to the sense of the magnitude of the journey with it like that. it's almost as if the more moving parts and the more chaos, the more epic the journey feels.

when I contrast an epic journey with a difficult journey, both have a sense of overcoming difficulty and achievement of the goal, but epic is so much more exhilarating and fun than arduous and difficult.

##### 2018-08-03 15:28 - stars and sex

while taking a shower I began to feel some ideas pushing me in the direction of sexual interaction (it could just be the added focus on sex that has been a result of the subject appearing so many times in my comments on the abraham workshop)

I really would like to discourage the idea of sex for me right now. I don't mind that you guys are doing it. I think it's really great, but I believe that sex for me right now would cause immense dissatisfaction. it is, energetically a lot like watching stars. in fact, I make the conjecture that it is the same energy as sex, but from the opposite direction.

during sex there are heightened levels of arousal, and this can bring about heightened levels of consciousness. you maintain your arousal and not let it get too big with focus. stars are exactly the opposite. they stimulate the brain (mental arousal) and bring you to heightened levels of consciousness also. you maintain your mental arousal also with focus, and the more you are able to keep your mind from spinning off, the more pleasure you will feel. there is a bit of a culmination (like an orgasm) that can happen as you are transported off into visionary sequence and feelings of ecstasy and enlightenment. in sex the energy moves in the opposite direction, when arousal becomes more than you can handle you orgasm. during the orgasm, and depending on its strength, you will experience a flood of consciousness enter your brain. that's what feels so good about the orgasm: it's the expansion of your mind that's taking place.

so, when I speak about the stars I am referring to how they *used to be*. I do not have this same experience now. what I am getting at is, I would like to gain control over this energy and not have it be the current false reality that it currently is while I'm watching stars. to put it simply, if sex is like staring (watching stars), then sex will be a very unsatisfying experience.

let's say that they don't have the code in place yet to make my sex experience like my star experience -- and then all of a sudden during sex I burst into visionary experience and heightened self-awareness and ecstasy. maybe they shock me (us). they'll surely come to the conclusion that they cannot possibly be having me go into visionary experience during sex (just like while watching stars), so they'll try and find a way to ensure that energy does not flow anymore, so that I do not have a visual experiences during sex (exactly like watching stars).

I think it's prudent for me to wait until this is sorted before engaging in energetic activities.

##### 2018-08-03 15:58 - stars, sex and government intervention

I had a strange thought just now, wondering if in some timespan the government will reverse its opinion on watching stars being dangerous. we now think it's absolute silliness to think that the government (or religion) can dictate to us who can have sex with whom, and what is taboo and what is not, etc. so, I can imagine a scenario in some amount of time where they totally reverse their position on staring, and say, "oh we were totally wrong about staring. it is beneficial for you and we've got this new technology that will allow you to transport your consciousness to other times and places of the universe with it." lol

you may have to wonder what they have to gain by suddenly reversing their position so drastically on sex, to follow that the very same thing may occur sooner than you think with the stars :D
