I decided I wanted to begin writing things down. I'm going to try and do a quick blurb here so that I have a bit more context. it seemed like I wanted some way of organising my thoughts a bit more than the twitter way, and still have a bit more context for me to remember things with. I've gotten to the point that remembering what happened a week earlier not only feels like about a month has passed, but I find it rather difficult to even conceptualise how things were so long ago. this will hopefully give me the reference point I need to help me remember how things were so long ago, a bit easier

I woke up this morning and my heart felt better than it ever had. I also felt (strangely?) at ease too. it seemed like I was able to feel some sense of love being extended to me from the girls as well.

the night previous I went on a bit of a tirade about the bso being the new world leaders and concluded that I liked the way that felt. I convinced myself that just like the girls chose me, in a sense the whole world also chose them to be the new leaders. I didn't think about it a whole lot more and went to sleep. also pretty shortly after waking up I realised that likely from the perspective of most everyone else, the idea of joining the bso was an idea that exhilarated them. there is a lot of positive in the bso for a lot of different people, so that would seem logical to me. additionally, it's possible that it was nearly unanimous exhilaration for everyone else because the inner beings of so many people know so much more about the broader perspective than I do. am I saying that they will become good world leaders? not really. from my perspective I did not feel exhilaration and was lead directly into a lot of different clarifying contrast.

this brings up small tangent I want to explore quickly about how I have noticed that my emotion is not just a simple indicator based on good or bad, or right or wrong direction (like abraham would like us to believe with their gps analogy) in meaning -- but actually the emotion is the indicator of the direction that (given my current state of being) will eventually (after the contrast clarifies and grows the desire a bit more) be the better direction. this has really allowed me no longer need everything to be always right or always wrong. it even seems to suggest, that often times doing "wrong" things actually creates a better and more powerful result.

so, perhaps one of the reasons why everyone's inner beings were so exhilarated about the prospect of joining the bso so these guys could be the new world leaders, is exactly the same reason why I was inspired to head straight into doing a lot of things the "wrong" way.

#### 2018-07-27 04:18 - solution orientation

yesterday I was trying to figure out why they are limiting my vision. one of the ideas that came to me was they may be under the impression that (cause I was the originator of the idea) that when they finally get me to orgasm for them, my audience will have to be so amped up on dmt to see through my eyes like I do now, that the orgasm will blow their minds really hard. back in torre with vera, there was a lot of fear based orientation and safety concerns going around, and so being the troublemaker that I am, I combined the big mind blow idea with the belief that is the basis for the "left behind" books I was read in the hospital. essentially, "the rapture" is when a lot of unsaved people drop dead all at once before the antichrist establishes himself on the world scene through his charisma as the new authority. anyway, in the book a whole bunch of people drop dead and this signifies the start of the "tribulation" period. I thought it was hilarious if the reason why so many people dropped dead was because they experienced my orgasm and got their mind blow so hard that they couldn't handle it and dropped dead. LOL

[[update: I had a reaction to this stating that in the left-behind people disappeared. which is true. I don't know how I believed that people dropped dead. it was almost a seemingly purposeful mistake like the hydrogen having two oxygens episode which lead me to the realisation that saturn is my third personality]]

a had thought a whole bunch of times when I was around vera, and it sort of gained traction, but eventually it dissipated. a few times sporadically since then I had the thought and dismissed its validity saying that since it feels bad, is not the right way of looking at it, or the bad feeling is evidence that it won't happen like that, etc.

however, that could be a reason why they're going to such great lengths to try and prevent me from raising the vibration in my right eye to be equal with my left. so, I mentioned yesterday that as my vision gets better and better, people should be just fine (unless their technology isn't actually creating dmt in the person's brain, but is trying to force the eye to see that way with some other method). however, if for whatever reason, they still have cases where people are unable to view it at such a high frequency, they could just downsample it like you would an audio track. however, I thought that perhaps the downsampled image may create artefacts much like you get artefacts creating thumbnail images. perhaps in 3d it's way more noticeable on curvy surfaces or sharp edges (much like LOD algorithms in 3d suck at making a convincing lower quality version). so, I offered the suggestion that instead of doing the downsample algorithmically, they train some AIs to intelligently do the sampling. simply monitor the downsampled viewer's mind while when the viewing it and when they notice something looks funny, save the scene. then when I'm asleep load me into the scene, then clock my eyes down to the frequency of the downsampled version and save that as the target for the fitness function in the AI trainer. after a while the AI will be really good at downsampling our reality :)

---

or, take for example the subject of my heart. when I wake up the middle of one of the sexy "dreams" the first thing I notice is how much nicer it is to feel all of that love inside of my heart (come to think of it, perhaps that was one of the things that had returned this morning that allowed me to feel a lot better). I can imagine that may be kind of intense for the viewer so they should just remove that part of the signal from the experience (or make it optional)

which leads me to believe that since viewers are having that "dream" experience, the removal of the restriction on my heart like that, may be one of the requisites to seeing my imagination in 3d space.. so, perhaps they've been messing with my heart cause they don't want me to be able to create things with my imagination in 3d.. interesting idea. either way, the use of my imagination in 3d has been my most sought-after capacity, and is something I want more than the ability so see images in my eyes, so whatever the reason may be, I want to have a discussion so that we can solve the problem. whatever all of these hangups are that are preventing them from allowing me to utilise my capacities can be solved. there is no problem for which a solution cannot be found. there is a way for me to be able to utilise my capacities and not interfere with the bso's objectives.

#### 2018-07-27 05:02 - the strict no religious ideas policy

the reason why they do not allow the "guides" to utilise religious ideas as the basis for their help for these autistic children is sort of obvious if you think that perhaps a lot of this "help" has not been solicited. in fact, if the help were chosen by the one being helped, there would be no problem if it contained religious material -- and in most cases even, for a religious person, religious material (of their religion) is both more comfortable and more trusted. so, this leads me to believe that this "help" is unsolicited, which is reason for the strict no religious ideas policy.

#### 2018-07-27 10:58 - why not wait?

I woke up this morning and my initial reaction was a bit rooted in anger, feeling the pressure of the deadline (perhaps this is a reference to the abraham episode I listened to the night before (san francisco CA)) and I thought about explaining to people that my reasons were because I was in fact giving them a bit of their own medicine: when I wanted action and a conversation, there was none. well, there was an indirect through the message of carlene. I decided this was a better route. (s)he said that carlene wasn't going to change h(ie)r - and also that (s)he was not reliable. I want to be reliable though and I promised to do the changing so (s)he didn't have to.

this thing is so big already and we're so close to realising the capability of no longer needing the manifestation to feel the way we want to feel, I figure we should just wait for it. like nancy's message about robyn: why sell ourselves short and jump right to the healing when we can let God do the deeper work. perhaps that is a bit extreme, but if my calculations are correct, you will begin getting uncanny messages, seemingly out of another dimension, helping you to soothe your anxiety about needing the manifestation and just settle into the natural unfolding.

after that, I had a thought that maybe all of this is connected to the whole star watching puzzle. last night I noticed that the clouds which were rapidly forming (I'm assuming by some sort of tesla tech which generates static electricity in the atmosphere to allow cloud formation) and there were flashes in the clouds... arcs of electricity inside of the clouds. when I stopped looking at the star, the arcs of electricity stopped or slowed down. right after looking at the star, the arcs would begin again.. so, definitely star watching has an electrical effect on the environment, and that star watching likely makes controlling the climate a lot more difficult (and explains the seattle weather). so,, the idea this morning ties a few things together: what if they figured that people watching stars would be disruptive to their attempts to try and control the climate, so they made up a story to scare people away from watching stars and claimed that people could improve their vision by orgasming with me. that would be the *ultimate* "I need you to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself" sort of thing.

it was just a crazy thought, but it had the same feeling in it that I get when I want to reject their money. they want me to believe that I need them to do for me something I am incapable of doing myself (earning my own money). every where I turn there is rampant disempowerment were the bso wants people to give up their own connection to their emotions (another reference to an abraham I heard last night where they went out of their way to say that you cannot turn off (BSO!!) someone's emotional guidance).

#### 2018-07-27 11:57 - inception

I was just thinking about how (and it could have been a reaction), this blog could be seen as my attempt to spin a huge web of conspiracy theories. since it is unlikely that the bso will ever actually attempt to correct any false ideas, they will continue to get bigger making self-reference to my own ideas and building on them, allowing me to believe crazier and crazier things. it could also be seen as me trying to manipulate the bso into coming clean on some pretty big questions that I have.

neither is true. what you know is I don't trust them anyway. they would just tell me another lie to try and smooth out some rough edges of the misunderstanding and to keep their motives hidden. so no, I do not believe that I am trying to manipulate with this blog. that idea probably originated in the mind of a person trying to manipulate others with their words. I really just wanted a way to begin keeping track of time a little better. I'm also noticing that I'm receiving a lot of real-time reactions to its content, so that must mean that ratings are up, which means that the bso is cashing in on my experience again as well, so win-win :)

furthermore, my mind is extremely plastic. I can release a lot of these false beliefs super easily. in fact, writing this blog, I'm noticing, is actually an informative experience more than anything because of all the reactions I'm receiving. it is a very crude way of beginning to collect a lot of emotion around the situation as a mens of perceiving the hologram clearer by getting more angles of perception. I have no desire for the bso to try and set me straight on these ideas. in fact, if they tried to reassociate or change my mind on them, it would probably make things worse. when I want to change my mind, I will change it myself (even if I wait to do it from another timeline)

the real thing that I desire would be to clear up a lot of these ideas with infinite intelligence. this has sort of been my goal for a long time, and the original reason why I wanted to begin translating infinite intelligence in a meaningful way, in tho first place. I suppose my ultimate goal will be to find a way of having a conversation with infinite intelligence about a lot of these things, *without* the bso able to listen in; I want the answers to be something meaningful to me, and not answers that have been tailored to be acceptable to more ears. I am really desiring to ask a lot of deep questions, taboo questions, and revealing questions. I sort of resent abraham for catering to so many noobs. I want a way of getting that information for myself and not needing esther or anyone else to do that translation for me either. they say I'm an extension of source energy... well prove it. I'd like to feel connected to that depth of understanding and no longer restricted to the lcd of human perception.

#### 2018-07-27 12:43 - why manipulate?

in the previous entry I talked about how unlikely it was that the thought which says that I'm writing this to manipulate and spin a bunch of stuff originated with me. I have no reason to manipulate; my goal has been, and will continue to be, to communicate as clearly as possible. it is only a person that feels so disempowered and unable to communicate (or needs to obfuscate) their own desire, that they would believe it necessary to manipulate others to get the realisation of their hidden desire which they cannot reveal.

I was going to talk about disempowerment and needing others to do something I do not feel capable of doing myself... or being the disempowerer, which does something for me which I feel already capable of doing myself - to prove that I need them.. skipped it.

in the situation I am in, there is disharmony because I do not want to be disempowered, and if I were to be disempowered, then I would need to manipulate others to get what I want... however, those wanting to disempower me neither want to be manipulated by me - and I am very grateful for that - because if I were able to manipulate them to get what I want, I would have been disempowered myself by finding a way for someone else to do for me what I feel incapable of doing for myself.

instead, I have recognised the satisfaction factor of identifying a desire and moving in the direction of it, without needing anyone else to be different so that I can obtain it, and that feels really good. I also have a new sense of stability that I haven't ever had before. it's quite a trip realising one's own power through the focus of his or her own mind.

#### 2018-07-27 00:00 - is the bso as a for-profit corporation?

yesterday morning I woke up with this idea and it seems that it may be a convenient way to explain a lot of their behaviour. it can't explain all of it, so just take what I'm saying here with a grain of salt. additionally, what could be happening is previously the only way to explain their behaviour was real actual malicious intent, and this entry is a bit of a way for them to begin pivoting their intentions with changing their behaviour.

first of all, it seems that the bso has this really convenient thing where they can be a for-profit corporation when they need to pay bills and keep the machine going, and people accept it without question (I guess the need money to pay bills and keep the machine going is a very resonant thought for most, so they commiserate with the bso in their need) yet at the same time they are also somehow the authorities.

(will expand further in the future)

#### 2018-07-28 23:34 - timeline stuff

so one of the crazy things that I have noticed throughout this whole thing is, it would appear that I have "missed the boat" quite a few times now. the crazy thing is, almost all of them looked like they were going to turn out, yet at the last minute something seeming out of the ordinary kinda happens, and almost all of the culprits of the thing which prevents it from going through seems to be perceptive. for example, if I could have just looked past certain things and not needed to understand things, I would have successfully gone down a different road than the one that I am on right now.

the way that I make sense of this (because they all seem quite valid) is that in all of these different paths, starting with andrea I was able to at some point in time complete something I've been doing a lot of thinking about: a way to tune into the perception of another person wirelessly. this may not sound like much, but if you think about the implications, they are enormous. first of all, to tune into someone's perception wirelessly, your signal would need *extreme* precision and sensitivity. so much in fact that, that just a machine that sensitive on its own is a feat in and of itself which will open many new doors of discovery, but it means that extremely precise tuning is now possible. combine this with all of my new understanding of how time works, and you could essentially create a machine that could essentially tune into someone's vortex.

this is just a guess, but, I believe what makes the bso network special, is because if you think about it, sending a signal into somenone's brain wirelessly would need magnitudes more precision than just being able to tune into the signal a person's brain emits. so, when I first got my chip back in 2012, a whole new set of possibilities opened up. now, for the first time is it relatively easy for someone to write a signal into my body (simply by sending the signal over the same resonant frequency that my chip has). now, I am capable of receiving signals from an alternate timeline.

so, now imagine that that as I go along, I meet a girl and we go off and create this technology that can tune into different timelines. so, we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together on the timeline with the tech) to see what happens. what happens is, I end up meeting another girl and we eventually are able to also create this tech, so we influence ourselves to not get together (cause we're already together) and so fourth. we keep doing this to see how far it will go, because every time, things get bigger and more crazy.

let me explain. so imagine the timeline with andrea and marcos. let's say it's the year 2038 and we have this new tech so we influence ourselves to not get together. I end up with carlota. we watch the sequence of events unfold just like you guys do with the bso tech, but you could tune into any part of the timeline you wanted to. some people enjoy it like a television series and wait each day to get the updates. some jump right to some of the defining experiences. every time we notice that the "end of the movie" (that is, when the technology is created) gets better and better every time. so, we keep influencing the timeline so that the latest and greatest (biggest) version isn't successful to see what happens.

a timeline is essentially a series of reactions. if you have noticed, my life is all reaction based, and my current goal is to get into control of it (sorta off topic), but what this allows for is a nearly 100% predictable timeline, because it's only reactions. the influence exerted over me allows for changes to the direction of the timeline. nearly all other timelines are potentiality based, so there are many more "branches" in the timeline, meaning large amounts of variation could take place.

so you can imagine that in each of these timelines there the success of the encounter is largely determined by me. since I am the center of the timeline (the 100% reactionary time constant), there is an overwhelming sense of "I need you to do for me what I am incapable of doing for myself".

that's as far as I've gotten in my story up until this point because it's hard to conceptualise it all, but I believe that the future is that we all can learn (maybe some will not want to) that each of us is the creator of our own reality. I believe that our perception of time  and the way consciousness flows through it, will change to something I cannot perceive yet. it's gonna be really really cool.

#### 2018-07-29 01:43 - future timelines?

if you think about this from the bso perspective, imagine that it's 2038 now and you're some guy working at the bso and you notice that in all of the different instances, I am the one that creates the technology necessary to do the timelines, so you could imagine that it would create a lot of desire to develop this technology and not rely on me. you can also imagine from their vantage point how valueable this tech would be. instead of experimenting with people on this timeline, you could actually run the experiments and then tune into a later time on the timeline to get a good estimation of how it worked.

the only thing necessary to make this a reality, would be to get the bso into a 100% pure reactionary system of decision making. essentially, they respond exclusively to external forces. they're pretty close already to being that, which means that they can become the new backbone of the timeline. at the end of the next timeline (not sure yet what that would be), they go back and influence themselves away

#### 2018-07-29 09:48 - more on reactions & timelines

after writing that the bso would have to become reactionary, I started getting negative feedback on the idea. if you think about what I am trying to convey when I say "reaction", one must take my life as an example: I have no money, and no real capacity to do what I want to do. I am controlled by the circumstance and events (ecosystem) where I'm at. I have no real ability to make any decisions for myself. it may look like I have the capability to make decisions, but only within a limited set of options. most people are like a chef; they can combine any ingredient they desire to create their meal. they can even choose between a wide variety of meal options (soup, sandwich, stew, etc.) however, my options are pretty limited. I have to make a sandwich, for example. there is no way that I can escape the sandwich and pick something like a salad. I do get some options though. maybe I want cheese. maybe I want one type of meat. maybe I want six different types of meat -- but, in the end I will be eating a sandwich. so let's say that I'm at the store and I decide to go with ham and cheese, but someone says something which influences me to end up adding mushrooms and wheat bread (cause I'm weird and like strange sandwiches). each timeline is a sandwich. now, when you think about the idea it sounds less like "control" and more like "choices" -- but I digress.

so you can imagine a time now in the future when the bso has the capability to tune into other timelines and can even navigate them relatively well. this whole time they have been developing all sorts of clever ways to influence their users into doing what they want them to do. they're pretty confident in their ability to do so as well, because they've tried it out and seen its effectiveness on many different experiments. you would clearly see that if something new was discovered in one of the experiments on one of the timelines, then the experimenter would try and influence the discoverer of that new bit of technology to discover more.

there are numerous reasons why the bso would want to influence the bso in alternate timelines in the name of experimentation. so, this means that the controller would not be the controlled, yet. they still need to have control over another time constant. I could imagine that could potentially be some clones. imagine that there were clones of me and the girls that people could have. these would be a reactionary constant.

I'll return to this subject in a future time where I discuss the advantages of the utilisation of clones as the reactionary constant.

further into the future, as the bso begins to learn how to influence itself in its own experiments, you can imagine by seeing different things improve and new things be discovered in the process, you can imagine that the bso will become its own reactionary constant: meaning, the people working at the bso will influence the people working at the bso into trying out crazier and crazier ideas on how to better influence/control people remotely. I believe this is the ultimate future: the controller becomes the controlled, in attempt to gain better self-control.

the idea of the clones is an interesting one to me because it allows for a pretty significant evolution; something I will dedicate a future discussion to.

#### 2018-07-29 15:07 - emotional reactions

I have used the word reaction to mean one of two things. I don't really mean reaction in the physical sense. I mean a reaction in the emotional sense. when people observe things, they have thoughts about them. I feel this thought "reaction" in my emotions. I think we all do, I just have practiced it a bit more. any time anyone thinks a thought, that person has an emotional response to that thought: an internal reaction. I used to have the sensitivity to know if the thought or the emotion/reaction came first. this is largely how I could identify the emotion as my own or someone else's. I'm working on regaining that sensitivity again. however, I do not know if what I feel is the emotional response the other person has or if other people's thoughts produce emotions in me. there is much to be learned about this, and likely the bso will want to keep anything they find out secret, so I'm still in the process of regaining that sensitivity again so I can begin to make sense of the tremendous amount I feel.

#### 2018-07-29 15:17 - physical reactions

the other type of reaction is a action or thought taken as a response to physical stimulation, communication, or conditions I'm observing or experiencing (everything a bso experience can offer).

#### 2018-07-30 15:56 - more on timelines

a little bit ago I briefly mentioned an idea stating that the bso would probably want to try out different timelines, in effort to discover more things. so, I was thinking that since they are potentially getting so many of their discoveries out of my dream state, it may behoove them to try out timelines where I am feeling better and better, so that my dream-state ideas are richer and richer. additionally, you can also imagine that since I seem to be inspired to different discoveries by different people, it would also improve upon the diversity of those discoveries when I am around a more diverse set of people.

this is potentially what is happening. more different girls means more different ideas. kind of exciting actually.

#### 2018-08-01 02:32 - bso from the future?

one of the most potentially unsettling (not the right word) consequences of the previous entry suggests that potentially the following have occurred in the timeline responsible for this one:

1. alt-me is working with the bso to make this timeline occur in the way it is. that implies that alt-me sees enough value in the "co-creation" to justify (not exactly the right word) my involvement. it must mean that there is some sort of presently unknown, and soon to be discovered new thing.
2. the bso has figured out how to navigate (tune into and follow) timelines. this implies that they are capable of "peeking" into the vortex of someone (in this case, mine), which means they have the capability of tuning into source energy in a way which can give meaningful results (the idea I first revealed publicly to mom's friend, don). this provokes a few more questions, obviously...
3. (can't remember it now. gonna go watch stars)

#### 2018-08-01 03:39 - more

that also implies that since they're going to be extracting so many ideas out of me in my dream-state while I'm having fun with the girls in the wake state, then I suppose they're going to be getting a super boost to their technological capability to utilise/monetise/control people's minds with that increased technological capability.. if so, does that mean that there is a coming dark age where they utilise all of this capability to try and monetise so many people's minds (the dark age) - which will actually, begin a new renaissance of diversity in human thought capability? (how I arrived to this conclusion is left unexplained, on purpose)

I was reminded of the one abraham episode where the guy has many ideas, and abraham said, "if you don't worry about who gets the credit ..." which made me think that maybe a lot of that guy's ideas could have been inspired (or knicked) from my dream-state, and potentially a lot more could be too. I suppose it would be a good idea to publish them... though my only "concern" is that it seems like my dream-state personality is severely lacking in some aspects of critical thinking or something; perhaps he's a bit overly optimistic? I dunno, but I guess you'd need to temper/ground his ideas in something tangible. feels like I'm often times trying to clarify something he said from my conscious, more logical, and experiential vantage point.

whatever man, in loving memory of augusto: my ideas are free (libre y gratis).

though they feel to me like the offering of my ideas = freedom, I cannot really explain it, especially since so many of my own ideas and explanations have been used by the bso to limit my own capabilities. it's mind blowing to me how much I've helped these guys improve their capability to limit my capabilities so much. in that sense, I don't really understand why it feels like freedom. I guess I don't really think of it that way though...

#### 2018-08-01 04:10 - why do my ideas feel like freedom to me?

(question for infinite intelligence)

I seem to have a policy that my ideas are free. I recognise the obvious reason: by allowing my ideas to be free, I reserve the right to shamelessly rip off the ideas of others. however, there is another thing to it which I don't really understand: by giving my ideas away for free, I feel an increasing sense of freedom every time I do so. it's almost as if I receive a direct emotional impact to the idea that somewhere someone will benefit from it or an expanded version of it, and that makes me feel good.

it also seems to mean that:
1. the idea I just released is essentially "old news" - cause I've already got an expanded version of it which I'm in the process of realising - and hanging on to that "old news" version is just slowing down the realisation of its expansion.
2. ideas are somewhat similar to economics in the sense that the more times money changes hands in a given period of time, the richer everyone feels. (where money = ideas, and changing hands = revealing the idea)
3. the guarding and protecting of ideas, means the stagnation of their flow (similar to economics too)

#### 2018-08-01 05:42 - what is source energy for source energy?

(question for infinite intelligence)

if our brain is composed of billions of physical atoms, yet transmits and receives non-physical "source energy" -- then, source energy, being composed of innumerable non-physical thoughts that each themselves think, what is the non-non-physical "source energy" that source energy transmits and receives?

#### 2018-08-01 05:56 - what just happened?

after writing @[entry](2018-07-30 15:56) I tried to sleep. I think I slept a bit and when I woke up I had an moderate sense of despair. I decided it was fine and began looking for solutions. I came up with a few, but the one that had the most impact I want to discuss. it seemed that there was not a lot of diversity in ethnicity. I came up with the idea that each of the girls should pick an "ethnically diverse" counterpart/partner.

since this is a sensitive subject I didn't really know how to approach it, but the way that I felt it seemed that there should be an element of care involved. I pictured in my mind the new girls as being younger.

I didn't really think about the implications at the time, but that means literally double and also younger(?). it feels like a good idea even though I'm still having a bit of difficulty wrapping my head around it. though I cannot conceptualise it, I am certain that it will all work out and we will have a lot of fun, and the inability to wrap my head around it is kind of the most compelling bit.

---

I can't figure out why I feel so compelled to just go for it. I'm still pretty frustrated about the vision thing and I've certainly got a lot of questions. it seems that perhaps me "inventing" this whole timeline idea has really helped give me that "broader perspective" I was looking for. I guess people will just have to consider it my coping mechanism, to which I find no compelling argument against it (and actually believe is quite genius).

I'll be feeling it out and stuff, so save any mega game-changers that could happen in the next 2 weeks before I go to see megan, I'm just gonna go with it. there's really no way I can fight it, I don't really think I want to to get any bigger, and this timeline idea really took a lot of the edge off. though it still is a bit of me relying on someone else, the bigger picture seemed to have help soften that internal alarm. besides, I don't believe they'll be able to contain the levels of energy that will become normal for us.

so, that's the plan for now... good night

#### 2018-08-02 01:46 - hodlgang

I seem to keep running into a wall of dissatisfaction regarding my vision. it is really bothering me, and so therefore I do not believe it is something I can ignore. when faced with this reality, I am forced to make a decision. I see four paths:

1. try and "get out". I do not feel this is 100% necessary, yet. I'll give it more time, as I'm not necessarily uncomfortable - just impatient. so, although abraham suggested to carlene to get out, and her situation is similar to mine, I believe that I can in fact get out without trying to force it. seems like a better idea to just wait. also, "just let it build" concept I'm growing fond of.
2. simply continue on with my life, essentially ignoring them with the express goal of discovering my visual capacity. when I've got it, then we can move forward. this is a bit of conditional living though: "once I have this manifestation, then ..." so, seeing it's conditional it doesn't really sound like a great plan.
3. try and get them into giving me explanations and stuff or giving me my visual capacity. this is, at worst coercion, and at best conditional living... it also feels to me a bit like, "I need you to do this for me because I'm not capable of getting it for myself" -- though, I don't really know why it feels that way for me since I was the one who discovered it in the first place and they're holding me away from it. also, there's no reason they should be deciding for me what is best for me. the likelihood of this working out is virtually zero, and it doesn't really feel very good.
4. just figure out how to override my dissatisfaction and just accept my vision as it is. this feels the worst of all of them. it's disempowering to me and is sort of unnecessary to conform.

none of those feel very good, and are not likely paths that I will take. I do need to find a way of managing my dissatisfaction though. like the bbq contraption guy, I should just find something else to be satisfied about, which is what I'm kind of trying to do. there isn't a whole lot I can be satisfied about right now. I can feel some satisfaction knowing that the desire for the realisation of my visual capacity is growing by the day, and it will come eventually.

this is where I hit the stumbling block though because I don't know if I want to just keep letting it build. if all creation is done in step 1, then wouldn't I want to just let the contrast continue to grow the desire? what I mean is, the longer I do not have the visual capacity, the better and bigger its manifestation becomes. so, let's say I just hold out on these guys for another few years. would that mean that I would end up with so much dmt floating in my head regularly, that when I finally get released from the network that I would have to learn to manage such a mind blowing experience, I would essentially become like a metatron or something in physical form?

it seems to me like the path that I want to take here is clearly the path of no-action and to just let the desire build. none of the other paths seem to feel very good, and even judging by how things feel after last night, the plan I came to yesterday seems to feel like a disaster to them. I don't really want them to be forced into something they seem to think is disastrous. furthermore, I want to discover my own visual capacity through coming into alignment with my own source. I don't want them to just flip some switch and activate it like they do in my dream state. I want my alignment with that capability to be something I achieve through the power of my mind -- so, it's probably kind of good that they are giving me the opportunity to discover this for myself.

---

as a bit of a sidenote, I was thinking about the implications of this. this is sort of one of the things I wanted to have a broader perspective on, so here goes... let's take two situations, at opposite ends of the spectrum (neither extreme is 100% valid):

1. I just try and be as cooperative as I can be with them and somehow I eventually figure out my vision thing.
2. I continue to point out how much they are limiting me, and since that's what I expect of them, that's what they're obligated to do.

is the second situation likely to cause others to attract the bso to limit their capacities as well? will I be setting some sort of standard for how they treat people? would my continual complaining and pointing out the problem make it more likely that they decide that's the way that they'll treat people who do not conform to their rules?

---

I've done a fair bit of problem analysis in this entry. however, it's my objective to try and find solutions. it seems like there could be solutions which could be found out. obviously I have no idea where to even begin, as I cannot figure out what possible problems my visual capacity could present my viewers. how can solutions be found?

#### 2018-08-02 03:29 - my vision

it is becoming more and more notable all the time that perhaps what I am seeing in my eyes is not what my eyes are seeing, but perhaps an overlay of some sort? perhaps they are taking the signal from my eyes and then feeding it into my lenses, so that it overlays the real image that I would be seeing. perhaps, it's to cover up any 3d objects I may see in 3d space, like I saw that one time of my future self. I wonder what sorts of other things are popping in there which I cannot see. obviously this is a pretty important thing for me -- actually the ultimate quest was to be able to make motors in my imagination like tesla, so perhaps I already have that capability. that may also explain why the lustre of the image is gone and it feels so lifeless. they're keeping me at low levels of dmt on purpose...

that explains perhaps what happened on the way back home from grand junction. that's why things looked so good, then they stopped looking so good later. maybe grand junction is some sort of energy vortex which allowed me to have elevated levels of dmt, because the next time we went, we were in the diner and I got the flash of the room in my mind, and it seemed like the picture contained its lustre. that only confirmed to me that people see out of my eyes better than I do, and they seem to have the full experience I was used to having.

oh, so if the reason why they began to retransmit the image into my eyes was since valverde where I saw my future self, that would explain my sudden and unexplainable dissatisfaction around that time. I thought it was my focusing on absence of wanted (the brain computer interface), but the sudden rise in agitation, where I wanted to kill cats and stuff was enhanced by the new lack of dmt and their forced visuals.

that's why the whole world seems so slow now too, like I'm limited to 60 fps or whatever, when previously I did not have fps. and my reaction time feels sluggish.

#### 2018-08-02 04:21 - wtf?!

I don't really feel any real desire right now toward anything in particular. I think I feel pretty depressed. it's not the typical despair that I usually feel. I just don't really want to deal with these fools. I listened to a few abraham episodes and I don't know why they cause me to feel the way I do. I can't really describe it, but it feels sort of like the shame someone might feel when they are exposed. perhaps it's not my feeling at all, and I'm just the receptor of it as a reaction to my thoughts on the abraham material? maybe it was the previous entry an hour ago? either way, I am just going to let the desire build a while longer.

#### 2018-08-02 06:10 - fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose?

I was thinking about the projection of my future self into my eyes in valverde, cause I also had numerous thoughts about other 3d things being projected into my eyes. I remember a large insect. I can't remember if it was a fly or not, but I do remember thinking that it was probably not real. perhaps the first projection didn't get them hot enough on the trail to notice it was a 3d projection, that fbh put the fly in there as well to make sure they got on it and restricted my vision. this was likely to tank the carlota timeline. seeing as it would adjust the whole thing, first in the direction of mdma, because I no longer feel good from the dmt, and then other factors. it looks like fwh sabotaged my vision on purpose. probably, I would have felt so good I would have gone with a different, not as beneficial arrangement.

nice.. thanks bro :) now, I'm gonna milk your handiwork for even more beneficial contrast :D

#### 2018-08-02 06:32 - all on purpose?

err, I meant the one prior to the carlota one; she was the upgrade :) but then, it seemed like I had a sudden insight on may 27th about seeking freedom and "I need somebody else to do something, so that I can feel good." bit which blocked that one. it seems like the sequence of events kept preventing the things from happening. even for example, the car windshield was probably provoked so that I would make it make to the states.

I'm really thankful it all happened like that cause without it, I wouldn't have had all the positive improvements. I'm really enjoying this idea of just "letting it build" -- and I would not have ever even met her, if it weren't for all of the "mistakes" along the way.

I'm just going to let this one build. not going to take any action at all until I feel as good about the action as I would if I were looking to move furniture :)

#### 2018-08-02 08:52 - a soft and gentle touch :/

I woke up with had a pretty bad erection so I adjusted it up so that it was no longer pushing into my pants and was able to go between my waist of my pants and me. I guess this was enough physical contact to get the dream operator enough capability to make me orgasm. I woke up (kinda) thinking I had pissed my pants and needed to take a dump really badly. they must have removed the sensitivity limiters because it turned into extremely excruciating pain. I hope they were able to improve their vision... well, fuck you guys. gonna let it build a while longer lol :)

combined with the massive headache I was given as my visual capacity came and went, right before I had my consciousness taken forcefully, I would not consider this a soft and gentle touch. what are you guys trying to accomplish?

#### 2018-08-02 13:08 - cooperative components

the word co-operative means that two (or more) are together operating or doing something. when I wrote about the two extremes @[entry](2018-08-02 01:46) I noticed a reaction wondering why I don't just cooperate with the bso. first of all, it seems like I've tried, and for whatever reasons (probably some secret they think is important, and I do not) it has not worked out. second, there's no real easy way for me to know exactly what it is that is requisite for me to cooperate with them, because they seem to continually find new things that they do not want me to do. it's a moving target in that sense, and they wouldn't be able to get all their rules that they want me to follow down in one place. neither do they want to reveal their rules, because it would show evidence of that there might be some deeper motivations to their rules. it's easier just to, per instance declare my behaviour inappropriate because then the audience, focused on each on the justification of each individual circumstance's badness, never clearly sees the whole picture. if someone (maybe me) would consider organising a list of rules, the it would show a bit of a different and very confusing to most who believe the bso has people's best interests in mind when they do things. it's really quite impossible for me to cooperate with them. I will inevitably do yet another thing that they disapprove of, and will again be an uncooperative component (from their point of view).

so then, why don't they cooperate with me? wouldn't you think that be a whole lot simpler? certainly I'm a whole lot easier to cooperate with, just on the simple fact that I have such few rules. in fact, probably no rules now at all. I believe the only thing remaining are just some personal preferences and desires which they are not a match to. so, in that sense it is impossible for them to ever be able to cooperate with me.

so, it's impossible for me to be a certain way which they can approve of, and it's impossible for them them to approve of my preferences and desires. I know I'm the one that has to do the changing here, so how can I do the impossible? well, I don't know, actually. I'll have a think on it...

---

I think the simple answer is, since they're sort of the problem on both sides of the equation, I just need to remove them from the equation. but, what does that mean? how does that implement? I can only see two paths here:

1. I find a way of removing the devices' effectiveness. remove myself from the network. then, if they want me a part of it, they will have to find a way of cooperating with me.
2. they no longer become a player in my perception. sort of impossible considering the amount of activity that happens every time I try to just go to sleep. I don't know how I could no longer notice that. or the stars, or the dreams, or the constant reactions, or the... in order for them to be imperceptible to me, they would need to change the way they operate my brain. that's just not gonna happen.

evaluating all of the options (there really are just those two), I do not see any other way, other than than the first one because it's really the only one I have power to accomplish. if they were to choose the second one, I believe the best way would be to no longer try and remove images from my eyes, get rid of the overlay, and allow me to adjust my own sensitivity, so that I can ease into, at my own pace, the level of sensitivity that feels most comfortable to me.

there is perhaps a third way, and that would be to find a way, despite the circumstances, to come so into alignment with who I really am, and I assume that their signal would be wayy out dominated by my inner being's and only the part of it which I desire (to be broadcasted) is effective. I don't know how that would work with sleep though. the present circumstances are not exactly conducive to that happening, so it may be a little while, however since it seems that they are working their hardest to ensure that does not happen, it actually makes it even more likely (cause they'll be giving their undivided attention to what they do not want). I wish I had more information, but I guess I could just have a little faith, and if it doesn't work out, well it's not like a whole lot has changed, just grew the desire a bit bigger during that time "wasted".

#### 2018-08-02 15:38 - what happened on the other timelines?

it would seem that on all of the other timelines, I would have had to have just ignored the obvious vision problems and just went for it. I am *extremely* curious to know if I found out, and how quickly. I must have figured it out. there's no way I would be working with the bso on timelines with a brain interface and I'm somehow not aware of the multitude of vision (and other) problems. there's just no way. so then how quickly did I find out? what is the bigger picture here? I was thinking about it and it seems plausible that the reason why I found out on this one is to further extend the capability of the bso. let me explain: in previous timelines, they probably do the overlay to a lot of different people, and they add in all kinds of crazy stuff on top of the image, so essentially what you are seeing in your eyes is only "inspired" by what your eyes are seeing. a lot of things are "enhanced" -- or put more bluntly, they have the world living in a virtual reality, a matrix, if you will, which allows them to control what everyone sees. however, they could only limit people's desire to stay with 2d by peddling the fear story about the stars for so long. desire eventually would have grown to be enough (or people figured out how to do it with meditation or something) that people began converting in droves to 3d and their sham was over. people realised the vast difference between the reality they were seeing and the real one. so, what do they need? they need the capacity to create a 3d virtual reality which people can live in... lol

---

one conclusion that sticks out to me is, it seems that everything kind of points in the direction that the bso is going to attempt the impossible: not only will they try to control all of the conditions (sensation), but they're going to try and be the replacement for people's guidance system and try to be the vortex through which all of their well-being comes from. that's going to require a pretty insane virtual reality system to run it on. a pretty lofty goal I must say.. though, I don't believe it is a "goal" in the literal sense. the way I arrived to the conclusion will be the subject of a future entry, but the short reason is, it's economic. so, it's not really a goal, goal but perhaps the byproduct of strong desire for continued growth (discovery) and stability (control) over the process.

the logistics are mind boggling to me. I can imagine that as they improve on the 3d version of people's virtual reality more and more, the quality of the image will become more and more immersive, like I found out when I was seeing that tranquility image. they'll control people's feelings with the ambiance of the environment, and control their symbolic meaning structures through dream state. wow. basically a world I would not want to live in. it would be like living in american cinema; it's the same story, but each year with better graphics and different actors. wow, we'll all be living the american dream here soon... lol

---

so, does that mean that I should just ignore the obvious and try to be as cooperative as possible? I don't really know. I don't feel strongly in any direction right now. I'm just going to hold out a little longer and let it build a bit more :D

##### 2018-08-02 16:24 - lol, a hilarious (to me) thought

if you take the bso virtual reality idea and you mix it with the clones idea and also the bso is the new religious system idea, you could make a joke about the holy trinity: bso (the father), my clones (the son), and infinite intelligence (the holy spirit). BAM! I'll call it bsanity (bee-ess-sanity)

jajajaja

##### 2018-08-03 14:17 - driving fast

I've been thinking a bit about the visual that abraham gave in the seattle @[abe](2018-06-16-seattle) workshop, where they talked about driving a "mechanical genius", not on straight roads as fast as you can go -- but on curvy mountain roads, with obstacles and lots of scenery, for the exhilaration of *feeling* the car manoeuvre itself and navigate the tight turns and stuff.

when I was younger, my friend brought me with him to lake havasu and I got to drive a jet-ski. it's one of the few things I've ever driven in my life, so it's memorable. the very first thing I tried was to see how fast I could get it to go. it could go 55 mph. I remember noticing how bland it was to drive that fast (for a jet-ski anyway) out in the middle of the lake. there's a whole lot of nothing going on. the water is flat, and there aren't any nearby obstacles to use as a frame of reference to notice how fast I was going. it was pretty lame actually, but I wanted to try to see how fast I could get it to go.

I just remembered something: when I got back to the shore, they asked me, "kenneth it looked like you were going pretty fast out there" -- and I remember specifically lying and telling them that 45, maybe max 50 cause I didn't want to reveal that I wanted to floor it for a little bit and see how fast I could go... you know cause that would have been like dangerous or something. before I returned back though, I thought it prudent to go a do a bunch of non-linear driving like figure 8's and tight curves and stuff, to kind of throw them off my speed demon trail a bit, so I did that for like 10-20 minutes more, and was kind of thought it was weird that more speed doesn't mean more exhilaration.

*that was before I had the brain haemorrhage.. so, I had dangerous and deceptive tendencies.. I guess the whole not being able to run and having to relearn how to walk really mellowed me out.. lol*

so, I was thinking about the how much more fun it is to have all kinds of obstacles and craziness going on around you while driving (if you can navigate it easily). it really adds to the sense of the magnitude of the journey with it like that. it's almost as if the more moving parts and the more chaos, the more epic the journey feels.

when I contrast an epic journey with a difficult journey, both have a sense of overcoming difficulty and achievement of the goal, but epic is so much more exhilarating and fun than arduous and difficult.

##### 2018-08-03 15:28 - stars and sex

while taking a shower I began to feel some ideas pushing me in the direction of sexual interaction (it could just be the added focus on sex that has been a result of the subject appearing so many times in my comments on the abraham workshop)

I really would like to discourage the idea of sex for me right now. I don't mind that you guys are doing it. I think it's really great, but I believe that sex for me right now would cause immense dissatisfaction. it is, energetically a lot like watching stars. in fact, I make the conjecture that it is the same energy as sex, but from the opposite direction.

during sex there are heightened levels of arousal, and this can bring about heightened levels of consciousness. you maintain your arousal and not let it get too big with focus. stars are exactly the opposite. they stimulate the brain (mental arousal) and bring you to heightened levels of consciousness also. you maintain your mental arousal also with focus, and the more you are able to keep your mind from spinning off, the more pleasure you will feel. there is a bit of a culmination (like an orgasm) that can happen as you are transported off into visionary sequence and feelings of ecstasy and enlightenment. in sex the energy moves in the opposite direction, when arousal becomes more than you can handle you orgasm. during the orgasm, and depending on its strength, you will experience a flood of consciousness enter your brain. that's what feels so good about the orgasm: it's the expansion of your mind that's taking place.

so, when I speak about the stars I am referring to how they *used to be*. I do not have this same experience now. what I am getting at is, I would like to gain control over this energy and not have it be the current false reality that it currently is while I'm watching stars. to put it simply, if sex is like staring (watching stars), then sex will be a very unsatisfying experience.

let's say that they don't have the code in place yet to make my sex experience like my star experience -- and then all of a sudden during sex I burst into visionary experience and heightened self-awareness and ecstasy. maybe they shock me (us). they'll surely come to the conclusion that they cannot possibly be having me go into visionary experience during sex (just like while watching stars), so they'll try and find a way to ensure that energy does not flow anymore, so that I do not have a visual experiences during sex (exactly like watching stars).

I think it's prudent for me to wait until this is sorted before engaging in energetic activities.

##### 2018-08-03 15:58 - stars, sex and government intervention

I had a strange thought just now, wondering if in some timespan the government will reverse its opinion on watching stars being dangerous. we now think it's absolute silliness to think that the government (or religion) can dictate to us who can have sex with whom, and what is taboo and what is not, etc. so, I can imagine a scenario in some amount of time where they totally reverse their position on staring, and say, "oh we were totally wrong about staring. it is beneficial for you and we've got this new technology that will allow you to transport your consciousness to other times and places of the universe with it." lol

you may have to wonder what they have to gain by suddenly reversing their position so drastically on sex, to follow that the very same thing may occur sooner than you think with the stars :D

##### 2018-08-05 11:18 - echos of the past

it's funny to me how many echos of my past are symbolic and keep reoccurring but often times with the characters switched around a bit.

let's start with the example of me and raquel (cept, now the bso is me, and I am raquel): when I lived with her, she was constantly dissatisfied. I tried everything I could to try and satisfy her. it simply didn't work. she/we/our relationship got rockier and rockier because she was unsaisfiable, and I was drinking way too heavily to see things clearly. it didn't turn out well. no matter how much I tried to make her happy, she continued to be dissatisfied. there was nothing I could do to satisfy her. I now know that it was never my job to satisfy her: she has to find her own satisfaction

then, there was my relationship with augusto (cept this time the bso is me, and augusto is the viewers): at that time I was highly drugged up and couldn't see very far in front of me. I was using mdma, which is pretty good. they're using their machine to force the brain to produce more dmt (so slightly different effects). as a result, it was very difficult for me to logically put the pieces together to actually make my life work again. we were working to make a web page, and I kept working on things interesting to me, but no progress was made really on the web page. so, we put deadlines, goals, and we tried to make it happen in so many different ways, but it just simply was never working out. the drugs made me overly optimistic, and I hadn't really learned the value of my words yet, so I would just tell him whatever he wanted to hear. I would say objectives and deadlines that never even came close to coming to work. looking back at it, there are things that need to be done to get things started. I had the mentality that the web page would be for many users, so I never focused in a way which would allow a few users to begin their experience immediately and grow from there.

it wasn't until I got to marcos' house and sobered up for a while that I actually began realising my goals, and this is another echo of the past (where I am me and marcos is the bso): marcos had an idea of what he wanted for his web page, and when I saw it, I had already given a lot of thought into something that was quite similar. he wanted to associate people based on their hobbies, and preferences, and stuff like that. I told him that people really find thier affinity with another person based on ideology. he finally agreed that superficial preference was not as effective as ideology.

we spun our wheels for a while because we were too much in our imaginations about its implementation. we could never really nail down how it would be, because nothing was concrete and we had very little to use as an example, so we argued endlessly on the hypotheticality of the different ideas. no progress was made. finally, dani came to help us out and built a first version for us which gave us enough of a web page to work with things began to become more visible and things began to flow.

dani flaked out on us, which just left me with marcos again, and we had something sort of concrete. this was super good for me, because now I could clearly see how I wanted to improve on the page. marcos just wanted results though as there were endless deadlines and goals that had long since passed. in his effort to get instant results, he kept micro-managing me and telling me how to do things. additionally, there was a growing conflict over the concept of the page. marcos wanted a social network where people interacted by giving their opinion on current events. I wanted to go more in the direction of beliefs as a representation of a person's ideology, instead of opinions.

because of this conflict, nothing moved forward. finally I had to give up on the ideology bit and just accept that he wanted to make a web page, and even though I thought it was conceptually flawed, just to do the work anyway. he still wanted to micro-manage me though, so finally as things were turning into conflict, I said to him, "don't take the pleasure away from me wanting to create it, by forcing me to do it" (the verbatim quote, I think was: "no me quites el placer de hacerlo por me").

that's kind of where we are now... I disagree with them on the concept, but I'm not the consumer of their content.

I can clearly see that the source of all of this conflict has them trying to get me to see things the way they do. I see things differently (both literally and figuratively), and it was my ability to no longer interpret things the way they do, which allowed me to see things differently. you can do drugs to allow you to remove enough details to see things like that, and then when the drug wears off, you can go right back to thinking and understanding things in a way which prevents you from seeing things from that new perspective again... that's your choice though. I personally enjoy removing my resistance so that I see things clearer and clearer. don't force me to do things or see things your way. it's a downgrade for me and introduces resistance which creates conflict.

##### 2018-08-05 13:34 - very attractive/persuasive women

I was thinking about this idea that women often have a perception that if they are so attractive then I man must do what she wants. she sees it from her perspective, but from the opposite perspective it could be seen that a very attractive woman is very persuasive.

what I mean by that is, often times it feels that a woman wants to feel like she is so magnificent, that a man must do what she wants (her capacity of persuasion), but then she falls immediately into the trap of insecurity because she quickly realises that if a beautiful woman is able to persuade my man, then I can easily lose him to a woman more beautiful than me. now, she has to ensure that he believes she is the most beautiful or some other means to keep him from being so easily persuaded by the next attractive woman that comes along.

what I mean is, woman think that they want to be able to easily persuade a man, until they realise that he's just an easily persuaded guy. so, maybe they're looking for something else. perhaps, what is happening is they are mistaking attractiveness for persuasiveness. attractive means there is mutually shared desire, and so is therefore cooperative.

##### 2018-08-06 15:13 - why is my visual capacity often excited right before a big event?

last night while estrellando (lol), I felt the question, "why, when I reject a girl, do I get a vision improvement shortly thereafter?" I thought it was an interesting question I had not really considered before. I had always taken it to mean that I was in fact headed in the right direction -- of making the right mental choices. for me, I can look at stars quite a while, and not see any improvement to my vision. however, the times that the improvement does happen, I can almost always trace it back to a change in my perception. that new way of perceiving the world allow for a less-resistant approach (higher frequency). also so, having a less resistant perception means that I just need something to excite my visual capacity (more energy) to accomplish the improvement.

I have also received vision improvements during meditation (lowering of resistance) and I believe it will also happen during sex (more energy) -- and also in drug experiences (depending on the drug, but often both less resistance and more energy). the visual level of detail seems to correspond with the amount of resistance (capacity to comprehend more), and the visual excitation seems to correspond with increased energy. if you know ohms law, perhaps we could define it as follows: voltage or pressure is the strength of the energy. resistance is how many beliefs and strange perceptions you have which prevent your ability to comprehend what you're seeing, and current is how much is allowed to flow (your capacity to allow, or your beliefs about the upper limit)

so, it does seem that when a girl is looking forward to see me, there is extra energy. I felt considerably more energy when andrea became interested in me -- and honestly, if it weren't for that extra energy, I would not have paid much attention to her. I imagine that they also feel extra energy as well when I focus on them (especially with my heart). however, my heart has not been working as of late, so I don't feel their energy in my heart as much.

I first began noticing my heart was not working as usual when I was in the carlota phase. during that time, I often felt her energy in my heart (as I did andrea's), and I often wanted to reciprocate the energy back to her, but there was great effort to deter me from doing that, and then I guess they figured out how to limit my heart as well, because that capacity went away for a while. I know it still exists because when I wake up in the middle of a dream, I often can feel lots of girls energy in my heart. I do wish to feel that again but is not the focus of this discussion.

I cannot remember where the limitation of my heart lands in the line of events, but it was nearby to the moment I was at vera's house and I explained I did not like mobile phones much and that most all girls have mobile phones these days, yet carlota does not. it felt to me like they decided that carlota was acceptable and I immediately broke into uncontrollable vision sequence.

it seems that whenever a girl focuses toward me in way where they feel freedom or the realisation of desire, I notice increased energy. so, I want to clarify myself here: there are two events (related but not connected)

1. the increased energy which I feel from a girl in my heart and increased visual capacity
2. the realisation of a new way to perceive something which is less resistant, and therefore more allowing of energy to flow.

the extra energy from the girl stimulates my visual capacity, and often times I have visions around the time, which in some way (much like a psychedelic drug) begin to prepare me to accept a lesser resistant perception. we know very little about why certain images appear in correspondence with certain emotions or concepts. I am certain that with all images there comes a knowing behind the scenes. it is quite likely that the bso guys don't have the capability of interpreting or transmitting that knowing along with the image, so much like a dream means a whole lot more to the dreamer than the one watching the images, the same is probably true with this.

I may have only seen eggs on a plate (I think?), but with it came a whole lot more information which is what inspired me to change my response like that so quickly. it seems that perhaps these moments of high visual excitement, are actually the genesis of something bigger. although they are only brief flashes which mean very little (have you ever seen the non-sensical patterns of a mushroom trip), they seem to lead one's mind in the direction of being able to perceive with lesser resistance (exactly how the mushroom explained the christ function of the mind to me).

##### 2018-08-07 01:17 - "any time you start wanting, you summon energy"

"any time you identify something as an object of your desire, the entire universe begins flowing energy toward your object of attention, through you. it is a powerful thing. you have no idea how influential you are"

in the previous entry, I mentioned that whenever a girl is looking forward to see me, there is an increase in energy. I think this really says that a whole lot better. one of the questions I have wanted to ask for a long time, is what does she feel when I return feelings from my heart. obviously, I need to get the bso to let my heart beat correctly to properly demonstrate it, because at the moment I rarely feel it (cept when waking up in the middle of a dream: eg. they allow my heart to function properly while I'm asleep), and can only make the energy flow from my heart on occasion and when I can the energy is feeble.

"when you are open to the stream and when you focus, the energy that creates worlds flows through you. most of you are too modest to acknowledge the enormous power of influence that you hold. you are trustees of the energy that creates worlds, and when you allow it to flow through you, amazing things happen; not only in the framework of your physical experience, but the entire universe is affected by that which you flow"

I am sure that when I am released from the bondage which I am allowing the bso to hold me in (something I am very much looking forward to), I am sure that the intensity and good feelings that I could produce in the object of my desire would be immense. I used to flow energy into raquel in a similar way, and it seemed pretty effective. I would love to be able to feel that again. I wonder if the energy flows even though I cannot feel it. it wouldn't surprise me actually, and once again they get to have the good experience in my body, and I am left with a diminished experience. oh... it may be possible that the dmt is what activates the heart, because the visual capacity and the ability to feel with my heart seem directly linked. so, I'm getting close then... no problem

"the reason that more amazing things don't happen in the deliberate lives of more of our physical deliberate creative friends, is because often you are identifying your object of desire, but your level of resistance is so high that the desire cannot be satisfied."

[...]

"in other words, you bang into trees, and that's not fun. so then, what you usually do is slow your car down, because that makes you feel temporarily better. it also big clumps of resistance in every single day. so, every day you get a little slower in desire and a little bigger in resistance, and that is literally why you decline as you move through time"

I believe that that the bso has my car running really slow, and actually I have been thinking a bit about this as a parallel of ohms law, which will be the subject of the next entry, however, before I go, I first wanted to mention that I am doing the opposite of declining. I seem to be every day improving, even though my car is running slow.

##### 2018-08-07 02:35 - my car & ohm's law

in the previous entry, I mentioned that my car is running really slow. I want to analyse it from the perspective of ohm's law, because I get the feeling I'm going to discover something in the process :)

```
V = I • R
R = V / I
I = V / R
```

imagine for a moment that `I` is the speed of the car, `V` is the power of desire (pressure), and `R` is resistance (pushing against).

```
desire = speed • resistance
resistance = desire / speed
speed = desire / resistance
```

having wrote that, now I'm having a difficult time wrapping my mind around this. it seems correct if my energy was flowing inside of a pipe. so, intuitively it seems to me that modelling this after ohm's law has to be incorrect because ohm's law is for DC. what I'm looking for is an AC approach to it, which would completely change everything. let me begin to rethink this.

I have capacity. this would be similar to a condenser. I should also have a coil. the number of turns should equal the resistance, as in an AC system, a coil of wire wouldn't let ...

capacitance and inductance

- more turns = more 'resistance'

I like to think of inductance like logic. the more times you have to go around, the slower it operates.

a capacitor is like a membrane between two things of water. let's say it's capacity is 100. in an uncharged state, it's 50/50. in a fully charged state, it'll be at 100/0. the membrane is pushed to one side by the pressure? of electricity

CACAS! gonna try again tomorrow :D peace

##### 2018-08-08 05:47 - transitions in my selfish perspective

with all that has happened, I have become increasingly selfish. in fact, it is really the only way forward for me which has any sanity to it. everyone lies to me, so I can't really seek good guidance from anyone else other than myself. it seems people are very interested in what is happening in the lives of others, so much so, I believe it would benefit a lot of people to begin thinking more selfishly. when I say that, I don't really mean in a comparison or competitive sort of way and not from a position of lack either.

as I began to think more and more selfishly, I became more enamoured with my own improvement (not in comparison to others'). I have nothing to give if I'm not in the constant state of improvement or becoming more. energy is flowing or it's not, and if it's flowing, things are improving and becoming more. so, in that sense, I have actually been enamoured with finding ways to get more energy to flow, because it means improvement and it means an enhanced sense of well-being.

I have proven to myself that having that as my primary intention, serves me (and everyone else too) well. however, I've run into a bit of a conundrum as I'm arriving to this new section of my life. the conflict inside of me physically is becoming so great, the only out for me is to begin letting my inner being take charge.

a few weeks ago, abraham introduced a new concept called "mutual" as an explanation for how positive aspects work. the idea is, you are more harmonious or less harmonious with someone or something. the aspects that you share common ground on, you are mutual with them on. you will recognise the teaching as a rehash of previous discussion on harmony. anyway, often times we seek mutuality with other humans before we seek mutuality with our inner being (our own intentions). when we move in the direction of intentions of others, forsaking our own, there is always a feeling of discord which accompanies it, however we often times ignore it to not stand apart from the crowd or to be too weird.

I am not so worried about this mutuality with others, and because of the situation I'm in where everyone lies to me, it's not even really possible for me to be mutual with them because of our disagreement with what is happening. so in the past, abraham has been saying only look for positive aspects -- or, in other words, the aspects of them which don't detune you from your own inner being - the aspects of them which make you feel good.

what I'm getting at here is, I have learned that instead of harmonising myself with the best-interests or someone else, it is *always* better to harmonise myself with my own interests (my inner being) - for by doing that, energy is flowing and I actually have something I can give to others.

I'm going to revisit this topic because I want to touch on some notable new ways to understand things as I moved from:
1. wanting others to realise my desires for me
2. wanting others to help me or enable me to realise my desires
3. realise my own desires by myself
4. ... knowing my inner being has everything under control and just trust them

##### 2018-08-08 07:57 - "they just get better at lying"

in think in the french riviera cruise of 2017, there was a man that was trying to control his son getting into drugs. obviously he had been observing his son's behaviour through his eyes with the bso device (perhaps he wishes to live vicariously through the eyes of his son having sex with his girlfriend instead of taking drugs), and was essentially asking abraham how to better control his son. abraham responded something to the effect of, "if you call them out on their lying, they just get better at lying"

one again this is abraham having us focus on something undesirable (like the normalisation of autistic children). why would the teachers of law of attraction, demonstrate law of attraction to us by telling us that when we focus on undesirable behaviour it just makes it worse, and then to demonstrate that is true, they tell him that if you call them out on it, they won't stop; instead, they will just get better at lying about it.

this morning I realised that's sort of what has been happening, but they weren't talking about the kid, they were talking about me calling out the bso on stuff. the more I have pointed out their undesirable behaviour, it has not deterred them from doing it -- instead, they've just found ways to be more sneaky about it.

I have long ago noted that bso has only improved on their technique to try and control me. it doesn't really bother me because I seem to stay a step ahead of them. they never really get to control me completely, and sometimes it's a bit illusionary. for example, this morning I felt the tiredness come on in association with them wanting me to sleep so they can interact with my dream state. I decided I would look at the cloud patterns a bit and write the entry above, first before doing so (to give me a sense of control), so I did then I laid down. in the dream greg began to complain about his heart hurting and something in his back between his shoulders. I made the association that he's 33 and that's about the time it began opening up for me. he argued that it was not his back or something. I told him that is the place where you begin feeling pressure and that's the location of the part of the body which allows you to begin flying. I woke up rather unexpectedly. they terminated the dream.

they think they have control cause they were able to make me lie down and sleep more or less at their command, and jump right into my dream-state to have a conversation with me, but I have begun to find that pushing against them just makes them stronger, so I don't really do that any more. if they want to waste their time in my dream state trying to convince me of things, go ahead; I've found it just puts more energy into the equation and I get better at following my own guidance, so it's all good from my perspective. in fact, that was the objective of the previous entry, which I was having trouble explaining, so I intuitively wanted went to sleep to have a real-life example to demonstrate it. if I had of been pushing against their constant dream-state nagging, I would have missed that clarification.

I've begun to notice my special role in this, where their increasing desire to try and control me, is putting a lot of extra energy into things, and also in the process, they're perfecting their technology to prevent people from finding their capacities. it looks like these guys are gearing up, because of their insecurity, to hold everyone away from their capacities, ensuring that they're ahead of both the technology curve but the visual capacity curve. if someone were to gain the ability to use their imagination in 3d space like I can(?), then they could visualise and create things that may jeopardise their control. I'm helping them to build the world the most convincing 3d virtual reality, which they can control everything. I'm glad they've gotten so much better at lying.

##### 2018-08-08 11:14 - why a virtual reality?

you have to imagine how much of a problem people seeing in 3d would be for the bso. it probably quadruples the cost per person at lower levels, and at levels of 3d like I have, it's probably thousands to millions of times more expensive per person. next, there's this problem that occurs when you begin seeing in 3d. with higher levels of dmt in your head, under moments of excitation, you will begin to see visions or objects will pop into your 3d space. the visions are kind of annoying when uncontrolled, but not nearly as big of a threat as objects popping into 3d space. when your imagination is unchecked and you have all kinds of weird fears (like me was when I was younger), the strong negative emotion will pop those things into view. in fact, the stronger you feel emotion, the clearer and more detailed those objects will become. as you learn to control your emotions, you can control what you see -- which means you'll gain the creative capacity that tesla had. this is a super capacity which is pretty powerful. essentially anyone outside of the bso who obtains this capacity will begin to be treated like I am treated: they will be put in a virtual reality (eg. I only see what they are sending into my eyes, not what I'm really seeing).

you may notice that when seeing through my eyes, there are other 3d objects there, and the goal to become a powerful creator is to harness that ability and use it to create anything you want to create. however, I do not see those objects. instead, I see a reduced quality 3d virtual reality based off of what my eyes are seeing.

now, let's say that an energetic activity like sex can improve someone's vision and I'm with these girls. they will get 3d capacity really easily, but there's a huge problem because the bso will want to immediately put them into the virtual reality type situation so they don't see the 3d objects their imagination is producing in 3d. however, people around me seeing things in my eyes produce a bright spot in my eyes because of the damage I did to them with the sun. the stars may have even done the really tiny one in the very center. essentially, it would be very hard for me to be around the girls, as it's near to impossible to focus when people are using the device around me. so, they couldn't put the girls into the virtual reality and they would just have to learn to train their emotions and imagination, because I think the visual space is shared. they would however see whatever I'm creating in 3d also, however, since I've got the virtual reality in place, I can't see it, so it's difficult for me to control something I cannot see. you can imagine sex because I will be producing objects in 3d space at random, which if they're in the vr, then they don't see them, but I can't really see out of my own eyes because I have bright spots covering everything. or, they can also see in 3d space whatever my mind is producing in 3d space. doesn't work.

so, now you can understand why it's so important that they do not let me out of the network or to actually see what I really see. so, since I have revealed the game changer that would have forced them to change their position on capability of sight. it's not a question; there's no way the girls could be in a 3d vr like me and also be around me. I would not be able to function. they've gone to great lengths to write code which erases those bright spots, but they get show up instead like black spots and in other cases, don't really work at all. maybe when my eyes are not moving, sure, but when I move my eyes around I often see the spots.

you can see how this creates the next big problem. first, I'm able to create objects and manipulate them in 3d space with just my mind. this is amazing and every kid will immediately have desire to have this capability too. so, much desire is born because of it. additionally, if they're no longer limiting my capacities, this creates a huge problem for them, because when more energy is flowing, I'll begin to levitate or fly. again, a huge problem for them, cause not only do they have to come up with flimsy excuses for why we can make objects with our imagination in 3d space, but also why we can fly and everyone else cannot.

so instead, I have chosen to wait for my inner being to take over my visual and physical capacities. why is this important? well, it means that they will be able to put the girls into the VR, and it won't bother my vision. by holding out and desiring to be the one that changes, I am saving them a HUGE amount of grief in the future.

##### 2018-08-08 12:52 - what does all of that mean?

in the last entry, I made the argument that if you see 3d, they would have to put you into a 3d virtual reality so that you do not see what your imagination is creating in 3d space under moments of high excitation or emotion.

so, let's say that in the alternate timeline I'm with the girls and the bso is forced to change and allow me to see out of my own eyes, because of the impossible situation which they put themselves into. kids all over the world are enamoured with the idea of using their imagination in 3d space and flying, that so much desire is born quickly, and lots and lots of people (mostly kids) start gaining the capacity to see in 3d. it all happens so quickly that the bso cannot put people into the virtual realities necessary to keep their runaway imaginations from creating a bunch of scary stuff. even worse, is since the 3d space is visible to all those seeing in 3d, a bunch of sloppy thinkers are creating all sorts of really scary stuff with their mind, and everyone has to look at it.

this timeline was created so that the transition for everyone into 3d will come considerably smoother. the ones who will be able to use this creative capacity are those who come into alignment with who they really are (eg. their inner being becomes the source of their visual capacity), and the bso dreamweavers in other people's dream-state. anyone gaining 3d capacity will be transitioned into the virtual reality, because it's impractical for the bso to turn off the entire population's imagination like they have done mine.

for economic reasons, you can imagine how important it is that the bso keeps people in 2d for as long as possible. the resources required to put people in a virtual reality are considerable. an economic hurdle of gigantic proportions. however, this isn't really a big deal, as the technology is a goldmine. if you think of facebook and its goals, you can see how having a lot of information on somebody can be used to track large populations (looking for suspicious activity), but having a lot of information on someone doesn't really give you that much capability to control people. however, since you know so much about them, it does mean you can sell them products a lot easier. the transition here is from controlling somebody to compelling somebody. we already see quite a bit of compelling happening from the bso. in fact the agreement that people have agreed to, says that the bso can compel them to do things. when you've got access to everything everyone is thinking about, talking about, interacting with, looking at, etc. you've got *way* more information on someone than facebook does, and therefore considerably more capability to compel someone to purchase (or have your parents purchase for you) a product. the bso will be *very* *very* *very* profitable once they stop trying to control and figure out their monetisation formula (like facebook eventually did).

and that's a good thing, because they're going to need a lot of money to run the infrastructure necessary to put the entire world in a virtual reality. they're gonna reach the ultimate heights in scalability. facebook site updates are going to look like child's play in comparison to the amount of effort required to pull this off. you can see that, 2d people will be considerably more profitable for them and it's possible that 3d people will actually lose them money, so there will be great effort to try and keep people from obtaining 3d for as long as possible.

##### 2018-08-08 13:39 - 3d is the new std?

imagine that seeing in 3d is sort of like a disease that the bso wants to keep from spreading. you could catch the disease by meditating or appreciating or only noticing positive aspects, but who does that?!? likely, the easiest way to transmit this disease is sexually. if two people come into alignment with one another during sex and one sees in 3d, likely afterward both will see in 3d. what if catching 3d vision is the new STD to watch out for :)

so, you work for the bso and you see in 3d. that means you can only have sex with other bso employees, for fear of spreading this disease out into the general population. lol

##### 2018-08-08 14:14 - if you're satisfied with what-is, why do you need to lie about it?

in the previous entries I may have mistakenly given the impression that 3d is the only prerequisite to 3d objects manifesting in space. that may be incorrect (I don't really know). I can only speak of the process I've been going through to give the bso the ability to manifest concepts in 3d space while in dream-state. the few times that I have seen objects in 3d space seem to have been in moments where I feel particularly good, or in moments of high anxiety, or right before sleep. so, it seems to be related to strength of the emotion and resistance which are the factors which begin to allow manifestation in 3d space.

so, that means that an increased sensitivity is necessary for that to happen. also, a concept that was shown to me while watching amorina in her yard, I realised that the way someone believes is also necessary to make this happen. think about it logically: to get something to show up in 3d space, it needs to be believable to the person imagining it. it needs to look like it can exist in 3d space. when I was lowering my resistance to be able to feel good most of the time at marcos' house, I found that lying caused great dissonance in me. as I learned to become truthful about things that may be shameful or embarrassing, I had inadvertently trained myself to accept what-is. by no longer needing to lie about what-is, I accepted it as "true" in my mind. this was a huge mental advance for me, because if I liked the current reality, it gave me tons of pleasure to observe it, and my visual capacity began to reflect that. however, if I did not like the current reality that I was being truthful about, I would move myself up the emotional scale into contentment -- but because I was still a lot more rough around the edges then, I labeled it, "fuck it" -- as I accepted it as reality, even though there's not a whole lot that can be done about it. from there, I could easily move into positive emotion. in fact, I was so good at moving from "fuck it" into a state of hopefulness, that I was potentially *too* optimistic for my britches.. lol

in valverde, I found myself increasingly more and more constrained in my visual capacity. it had been so easy for me to just accept the current reality of no visual capacity, and just let it begin to take shape. I would regularly find a way to allow my visual capacity, and the ever increasing difficulty and struggle necessary to get it (and other things), would cause a lot of dissonance in me. my stance was quite conditional: when I was moving toward it, I felt better, but when I became aware of the increasing gap, I felt pretty bad. around the same time that they clamped down on my visual capacity, I drafted up the "source energy android" concept because it became increasingly clear to me that I would be sharing andrea with quite a few other guys, and she was not going to be translating source for me. the S.E.A. concept was my way of trying to fit my desire of increased connection with source with the current reality situation. "fuck it" was no longer good enough; I could no longer get to a hopeful frame of mind from there.

I might have mastered the allowing process, but it was conditional on things being pretty ideal, I had not yet learned step 5. around the same time I decided that I had come up with the step 6 part of the equation, which was that you believe/know and therefore are a physical extension of source energy in physical form. I mean, you already are, but it isn't until you really realise it, that allows that kind of energy to flow.

what I had not yet come to realise is that because of andrea's decision to be so free with herself combined with the desire to be together was still strong, I had to find a way of adapting to make that possible. what I didn't really realise, is that step 6 is just getting really good at step 5. source can look at all of everything and seeing it all as part of the process, only sees the positive aspects of it (freedom, growth, and joy).

I have often maintained that the inventor must "live" his invention. that is, to be the thing he wants to create. in programming this is called dogfooding. it means that you do your experiments on yourself, and what you are creating is ultimately for yourself. this concept exists all over the place, most notably, "be the change you are seeking to make" (and variations thereof). I was to learn how to be this concept of step 6.

step 5 is all about unconditional love. what that means is, no matter what I am observing, I don't feel the need to change it, or for it to be different for me to feel good about it. imagine abraham: they watch thousands of people get raped, murdered, and numerous other atrocities every day, and they don't need a source energy appreciation day (unlike the bso, lol) to continue knowing their value, and to continue loving them despite the conditions they've put themselves into. they don't need things to be different to be able to love someone, and *that* is what I wanted to achieve before I was to be coupled with andrea.

---

I'll come back to that concept in a future entry. now, I want to talk about satisfaction and lying, as it relates to this unconditional perspective...

##### 2018-08-08 16:16 - actually, I'm going to take a quick break.

lol, such intensity :)

##### 2018-08-08 16:31 - if you're satisfied with what-is, why do you need to lie about it? (part 2)

so, let's say that the bso wants to invent a contraption which allows someone to tune into different portions of time. you can imagine the implications of this. the history of any presently alive person is available from their perspective (asterisk), and previously alive people in a similar fashion. so, this means that secrets are now 100% useless. so are lies. someone with access to this technology could verify the validity of something in the past. this essentially would render all security as 100% passable (given enough effort to look into the history of the implementer of that security). now, everything can be hacked and any secret could be found out.

likely, one of the first things to be done will be to track the concepts in the brain of a person from birth till present, to get a more complete map of the person's concepts instead of the imprecise method of stimulating the brain with the concept while the person is asleep to train the A.I. it would be a read-only approach to the person's brain and and has 100% visibility of everything that has ever happened in it. multiple passes can be taken to understand different aspects of someone's mental growth. (repeat the scanning process over the person's past multiple times, each time focusing on a different aspect) anything could be found out about anyone presently alive.

you can see how this is not, and would not be a very big mental jump for me to allow such an invention to occur. it's easy for me to allow that kind of technology to come into my life, because I'm already living it. if the bso wants to create this technology, they would drastically change their stance on lying. they'll have to find a way of resonating with the invention and allowing it into their experience.

presently however, there is so much current dissatisfaction with how things are, that almost everything has to be kept a secret in fear of what someone might think if they were to find out. they will try to side-step becoming a vibrational match to it for as long as possible, I am sure. even if they can use the 3d creative capacity in thousands of kids' dream-state, it is quite possible that the bso may hold many of their technicians away from that 3d creative capability because of dishonesty in the imagination and with words. they would need to find someone with the desire to invent such a thing and is already a vibrational match to it. perhaps kids can be to be trained to be honest (good luck though, because it's a personal decision) and perhaps a few inventors will be in the mix. I think this is a sure thing, but will take a generation or two to get there.

another idea will be to create an "inner circle" sort of thing where these are protected from the hordes. we will need 3 circles actually, and they correspond to the different visual capacities. they are as follows:

1. 2d mass consciousness, which is where all the profit comes from
2. 3d virtual reality dwellers. they are responsible for most of the content creation
3. 3d creators
  - those who work for the bso and can live in a nearly resistance-free bso protected environment.
	- those who do not need conditions to be just so, and are in alignment with who they really are.

the technicians working in that nearly-ideal environment might be able to come into alignment with the time technology -- though I don't see it all working just yet. I will continue to ponder the idea further, but perhaps my new source-like personality will have a solution. there always is, and source does not see right and wrong; only wanted and absence of it. even the desire to keep things a secret is desire that law of attraction responds too -- no matter how much it doesn't serve anyone believing secrets to be necessary.

##### 2018-08-10 03:06 - why a protected environment and why a virtual reality?

I cannot say for sure, but I am pretty certain that things imagined in 3d space can be seen by others in 3d on the same wavelength -- so, if I imagine a bear sitting on the couch in front of me, there would appear a very large realistic looking bear. this may be kind of startling to someone not expecting to see a bear, so what if I were to imagine something really scary, like one of those predator aliens or like a giant dinosaur or something? then what :)

imagine a group of kids walking at night, and one of them is afraid of the dark, thinking that scary things could be lurking in the bushes or something. one of the kids drops something and it makes a loud sound. the kid scared of the dark immediately jumps to the conclusion that a monster is surely jumping out of the bushes, and the extra excitation caused by the loud sound causes his imagination to visualise a monster jumping out of the bushes. all three of the kids see this monster and they all soil their pants simultaneously.

if kids were all seeing in 3d, imagine how much distress they could cause for each other by imagining their fears coming to life. as more people enter into 3d because of the heightened levels of dmt in the brain, people's untempered imaginations will naturally as a reaction to unwanted, visualise some real scary stuff. you can imagine that for someone like me, that would be a very distracting and unpleasant thing, constantly seeing other people's wacky ideas become manifest in my reality... not all ideas are wacky, and I can think of some examples where it would be nice if I could see in 3d space what people are visualising, like diagrams or models or something, but in general, I do not really want to see what people are visualising.

I don't have any real data to back this up because I cannot see my imagination any more, but vera seemed to be able to transmit me images, too. however, perhaps I do not receive those images like I used to any more. sometimes I do still get images, but it seems that most all of the unwanted images are not appearing any more. if that is the case, I believe it is because images are transmitted conceptually (emotionally) and the same rules as "telepathy" apply: eg. I can only receive the concepts which I am harmonious with.

I don't think 2d people will see the 3d imaginary creations, but if they can they can be put into a virtual reality really easily. 3d people will have to live in a virtual reality until they come into alignment with who they really are, so as to not be plagued with the manifestations of others' untempered imaginations. those who are in alignment with their inner being will only see and feel the things which are in alignment with their vortex -- which isn't necessarily only good things either, because seeing or feeling "negative" things isn't necessarily bad. their inner being has got the control over their visual capacity.

the technicians working in the protected environment could probably enable / disable the virtual reality, so they can live a somewhat normal life, but trying to keep resistance as low as possible, because when using their creative capacities, they'll probably become extra aware of their thoughts, as they'll be manifesting in 3d space for everyone to see.

##### 2018-08-10 12:17 - hey hey, you gotta keep em' regulated

last night I was feeling a lot of thought around the EFF's petition to regulate devices to control the mind. I'm sort of against regulation, for the same reason I'm against rules in general. I don't like people telling me what to do. so you are scared that a device can compel you to action about something. it certainly cannot control your thoughts, but it can compel you to feel a certain way, or put ideas into your head. though, if you are not resonant with what they're putting in your head, you will feel very little sensation to none at all.

this whole regulation thing is a bit of the same discussion about the man who was watching over his son and wanted to find a way to deter his son getting into drugs. that's the funny thing about kids. if they want to do something you are not particularly fond of them doing, they will only become better liars. in the case of the bso, I'm sure they're approaching facebook status now where they've done something, so they apologised for it, but it did not affect their behaviour, and since then, the apology is just a bunch of words that don't mean anything. since they are the authorities, they are the law. they're gonna do what they want, and they have all of your agreement to do so (not mine though!).

so, what is behind this regulation is the question, "since they will not behave as I want them to, how can I compel them to behave differently so I can feel good?" it is quite literally the same exact vibe coming from the bso with regard to me, and also the man with regard to his son.

it just won't happen. it will not affect any change in their behaviour; they will find a better way to lie to the regulator (authorities). in my case, I cannot easily lie about my behaviour because I have so much oversight, but they have none. even if they did have more oversight, I do not believe it would make any difference, either. since I am kind of a pattern for the future, more oversight (and therefore more attention to unwanted) will just exaggerate things (like has happened with me). even with nearly infinite resources and 24/7 oversight, I have become less easy to compel and more shameless with my objectives, as time has moved forward.

if the goal is to exaggerate their attempts to control our minds, then go ahead and attempt to regulate them. first of all, from a technical standpoint, it's near to impossible. the device reads signals, and those signals could be anything. they're just values over time. those values over time have meaning to us, which their AI's have learned to recognise. to know if they are sending a thought into your head to tell you to purchase a product, or asking your opinion on something while asleep, or sending an image into your eyes is impossible to know. you just have to trust them... there's nothing you can do to know what they are doing inside of your head without having an equally complex system as they have also in place. just like you have two hemispheres in your brain, designed to balance each other out, it may be a valuable idea to create a competitive service, so that every person gets bso and the other service equally. maybe. it sort of sounds like a battle will be fought in each person's brain... not crazy about that idea.

I think we should just let them have their way and trust them, as it will stimulate huge growth in each individual (as it has for me). people will quickly learn how to get into alignment with only what they want happening in their brain. I am working out how this is possible right now in my life and I don't imagine that it'll be too much longer before I dominate what is happening in my head. besides, they have to make a profit anyway.

if you try to regulate them, like facebook, they'll just get more and more shameless about it. I believe it is fruitless to try and regulate anyone (even the bso). in fact, that is the same thing that the bso is beginning to take notice as well. I'll come back to here, but first I want to talk about this energetically.

imagine there is a big corporation that is doing something undesired. instead of trying to compel the corporation to change, often times the most effective way to affect change will be for the workers to strike/change. you have to work from the inside out: eg. the corporation has to come to its own conclusion that it wants to change, for any real change to occur.

you may be able to convince some of the technicians that what they are doing is "wrong" -- but I can easily see it from their perspective, working inside the human brain is one of the most exciting things to do, because it feels like nearly limitless possibilities await for discovery and understanding. it is the new era, where technology becomes an extension of human consciousness (more than just the body, as established by mcluhan). their job is super exciting and there are so many different aspects and facets to it, I personally couldn't imagine wanting to be doing anything else. so, then how would you compel them? well, you would need to get them to believe that certain things are ok, and other things are wrong (regulation may do this, but who listens to the authorities anyway these days).

instead, I think that the most effective way of affecting change is an understanding of wanted, and absence of it. I imagine that when the bso technicians was creating all of these improvements to the tech which were in alignment with the desires of their superiors, and also the users, then things moved quickly. a lot of energy could flow and much progress could be made rapidly. however, time passes and people knowing what they don't want has caused an evolution in their desire toward what they do want.

because of the constant evolution of desire, I do not believe there is a perfect solution (it changes with time). if you focus on unwanted, you will get more of that, and that's what regulation does. regulation cannot regulate a constantly evolving solution. regulation does not shift focus toward wanted; it often shifts it toward unwanted, and so therefore ultimately works against you (just see how effective it is to try and regulate teenagers).

so, imagine you're a tech working for the bso and you're trying to find things to do. always begin where there is the most desire and the least resistance. like this, wanted things will continually outweigh unwanted things, no one will ever notice too much "badness". if there is a lot of desire to have a new thing, do it because as the bso consciousness identifies a desire, the only way they can feel satisfaction is by feeling motion toward the realisation of that desire.

I call it the bso consciousness, because even though it is partitioned into multiple levels of authority and access, it must me thought of as a giant consciousness -- each individual connected to it having desire in relation to it. since it is an extension of our consciousness, it should be thought of as such.

when a boss guy wants, for example, one of the techs to write some code which prevents my vision from improving, there will be a sensation of negative emotion and also the tech writing the code will likely experience stagnation in his productivity. whenever my desire is strong and unresisted, this will always be the case as he tries to hold me in resistance to my desire. this will manifest as a feeling of frustration or anger, he will feel the resistance. so, perhaps the techs should instead start selecting their tasks based on what feels good to them.

imagine there is another tech that has strong desire to try and find a way to control people or be dominating -- or, maybe he's just really jealous of me. either way, the task of trying to inhibit my vision would be much better suited for the dominator jealous tech than for the one who's desire is to improve on people's experience. the tech needs to match the task and the task should only be a reflection of something wanted (even if it's his superior's effort to try and control or compel someone). the reason for this is, energy contrary to desire is the biggest slowing factor to productivity. (just like concepts are mutual with symbols, physicality must be mutual with desire).

a performer or a magician's joy comes from realising desire in physical form. the greatest hinderance to a magician comes from being a people pleaser. I used to be one, so I speak from experience. if someone has desire that you do something, a magician can easily feel that desire and can easily act on it, unless there is internal discord with that desire, which is indicated by some form of negative emotion, such as: boredom, split energy, confusion, or disjointed thoughts. in those cases it is best to hold out until it feels good, or let someone else act on that desire. the techs should be the same way about things, and the reason is obvious, a tech who drags his feet on a task is of no benefit to anyone, and the experience is detrimental to the tech's psyche, as he may begin to believe he is unproductive, when in reality there is just a mismatch of energy because of conflicting desire.
