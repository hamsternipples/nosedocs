I think when I did ketamine that one time, I was immediately able to release the resistance which is holding me from my full connection to my source. ponder this and try to remember what it felt like, just like you did when you wanted to regain 3d. remember what it felt like, imagine it and tune in to that.

with the power of your focus, you'll have it sooner than you know.
it really is easier than you thought it would be.
you're just a few thoughts away from realising it.

you can achieve it as soon as you stop doing that thing you do which keeps you from it (think thoughts in opposition) -- and you know when you're doing that thing the moment you feel any negative emotion...

it is good to know that every time I have known what I don't want, I have increased the desire toward what I do want. so I've got a pretty powerful desire going
