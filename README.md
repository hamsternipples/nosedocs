# nosedocs

these are some documents which have been inspired by various nosebook reactions and some life experience. supposedly, I am making up 90% of my reality by inventing this giant conspiracy which I am calling, "nosebook".

I hope my perception of some of the topics this conspiracy has to offer, will be of interest to you. thank you for joining in on this journey with me; it has been quite the experience up until now :)

#### nosebook

a perceiver-net where the nose of the person's experience you are having is most noticeable. also, a network of people with their noses in a lot of places it shouldn't be.

#### history

the origin of the distinctive term, "nosebook" goes to abraham hicks. when I was living in valverde de la vera, I first became aware that others could actually see through my eyes, and in one of the abraham hicks recordings, they call facebook, "nosebook" -- "because you've got your noses in lot of different places that don't serve you very well." that phrase caught my attention and I eventually asked myself out loud something like, "I wonder if the reason they called it nosebook, is because you're not used to seeing through someone else's eyes, and so their nose is the first thing you notice." judging by the reaction that I got, I knew that my observation had some truth to it.

however, I did not begin calling it nosebook myself until just recently. I used to call it facebook, but that almost always garnered a negative reaction. part of the reaction was from facebook corporate guys who feared that facebook would be associated with spying in their user's minds. additionally, I think that most people perceive facebook as this really friendly place where all of their friends, family, memories, and anything of value in their superficial lives can be found. therefore, the things I was claiming nosebook is doing, caused a lot of mental chaos in a lot of people. the reaction felt to me something like figuring out that someone that you trust is actually betraying you. (sure, you can indeed say that is a projection of the way I feel about the main antagonist in my overarching conspiracy -- lol)
