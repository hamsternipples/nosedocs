# nosedocs

these are a set of documents which are inspired by nosebook reactions. apparently, I am making up 90% of my reality by inventing this giant conspiracy which I am calling, "nosebook".

I hope my perception of some of the topics this conspiracy has to offer, you will be of interest for you. thank you for joining in on this journey with me. it has been quite the experience up until now :)

### nosebook

a perceiver-net where the nose if the person's experience you are having is most noticeable. also, a network of people with their noses in a lot of places where it shouldn't be.

#### history

the origin of this phrase goes to abraham hicks. when I was living in valverde de la vera, I first became aware that others could actually see through my eyes. in one of the abraham hicks recordings, they call facebook, "nosebook" -- because you've got your noses in others' business. that phrase caught my attention and I eventually asked myself out loud something like, "I wonder if they call it nosebook, because you're not used to seeing someone else's nose through their eyes, and so it's the first thing you notice." judging by the reaction that I got, I knew that my observation had some truth to it.

I did not begin calling the network nosebook myself until just recently though. I used to call it facebook, but that almost always garnered a negative reaction. part of the reaction was from facebook corporate guys who feared that facebook would we connected in their user's minds with spying. additionally, I think that most people perceive facebook as this really friendly place where all of their friends, family, and most of our superficial lives worth is tied up, that the things I was claiming nosebook is doing, caused a lot of mental chaos in a lot of people. the reaction felt to me something like figuring out that someone that you trust is actually betraying you. (yes, you could say that is indeed a projection of the way I feel on to the main antagonist in my overarching conspiracy -- lol)
