my awareness of the missing things in my now are preventing them from coming
my awareness of now is preventing now from changing
my attention to my incapacity to realise my discoveries is what is preventing my discoveries from being realised.

I should be focusing:
 - more on the feelings which can produce those not-yet-manifested realities.
  - the feeling of expansion
  - the feeling of freedom
  - the feeling of the new
  - off of the feeling of disappointment that now is not more
 - more on the satisfaction I am presently experiencing in this bouncing off place

 more:
  - light-hearted
	- easy about things
	- aware that thing are already happened and I'm just tuning in to them
	- allowing

less:
 - making thing happen
 - determined

the more desire that is present in someone, the more the absence of that desire is obvious.
the more the absence is observed in reality, the more the presence actively exists (though still in non-physical).
so, that just means there is a lot of energy and the only reason why I don't feel good, is because I'm denying it's presence
