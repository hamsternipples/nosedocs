host establishes the arena and the game rules
rules are determined over time by constant feedback and therefore modification from the hosts
different game modes are created, then mods are proposed, tried out on hosts running that mod (or players that elect to use that mod), then over time the mods become a part of the mode (a new fork is made in the rules). over time these branches will need maintenance and most of the game will actually be focused around moving around logic inside of these branches and applying the artwork/animations to them

write out a condition that needs to change (very detailed). then, if that condition were to change, write how would that make me feel?

it's not that it's desirable, but that it's alright - meaning no action is required right now.

things being alright how thy are
allowing things to change

life is a bit paradoxical
you get too far to the left and never want things to change, and you contradict the expansion of everything.
or you get a bit too far to the right and want things to change so much that you are never ok with how things are right now.

if you visualise those two extremes (of being so ok with things that you don't want them to change and, wanting change so badly, things are never ok how they are) as a potentiometer with different amounts of resistance over the range of the dial, then all points between the extremes have some resistance to them.

we are always resistant to the opposite thing, so how does anything change then? it's our perception that changes. when something is new, things are good how they are, but as time goes on, we begin identifying improvements (or things we don't like about the present incarnation), and so we will begin to desire change.

*----------------------------------------*
|  *-- A (things can be how they are)    |
|  |                                     |
|  8                                     |
|  8 <--*                                |
|  8    | C (your point of attraction)   |
|  |                                     |
|  *-- D (things can be better)          |
*----------------------------------------*

you can see that all progress happens by alternating point C's proximity to points A and D. this back and fourth movement is similar to breath, time, or alternating current. movement forward, effort, or work done is determined by the frequency which connections AC and DC approach moments of least resistance.

(optimisation can be performed by reducing the least resistant states between connections AC and DC allowing more current to flow during those moments)

while pondering this today, I came to the greatest discovery of all time: while it is fun to alternate between AC and DC, the best is to actually live the paradox of being ok with things how they are, and at the same time, allowing them to change into something better -- is actually the best. this would be like taking a piece of wire and connecting points A, D and C all together. the only resistance involved is the resistance of the wire connecting those points together. this connection of "zero resistance" is analogous to the way that source perceives things: although there is slight resistance in the wires and the infinitely different ways of configuring those wires, those tiny changes in resistance are essentially imperceptible to us. I do look forward to one day being able to perceive those tiny resistances, but I first find it more prudent path to first practicing zero resistance perception by living the paradox of unconditional expansion.

how does emotion play into this? well, let's say that in this moment connection AC is of least resistance: you are in a moment of appreciation of how things are right now. things couldn't get any more perfect, and so it is time to begin identifying how things can be better

# how to effortlessly grow big solutions to unsolvable problems

the secret to this easy technique's success is its ability to leave other aspects of your daily life completely unaffected by these enormous problems your growing

#### testimonial

I used to wake up feeling horrible, spend the entire day focused on things that don't feel good, work really really hard at finding solutions to problems unsolvable problems, pointing out endlessly that they're only getting worse. passing out every night from exhaustion, I knew there has to be an easier way. there is! with this simple technique, I turned a truly exhausting way of life into a simple 20 minute daily ritual. you will not believe how easy it is until you try it for yourself!!

### practical easy to implement [...]

guiding principals
ok, let's get started

 - first, write out the problem as detailed as possible. include as many reasons why it is unsolvable
 - then, write out the way I think I would feel if things were different, or the way I want them to be.
 - also, write out different things that could potentially improve if a solution were to happen
 - finally, after all of that, shoot myself in the foot by doing a focus wheel about my core beliefs which are holding me away from realising the solution, to reinforce them further and prevent me from coming close to receiving any solution whatsoever
 - for bonus points, try and identify new evidence which corroborates my core beliefs and further proves the validity of them

1. since when we know what we don't want, then naturally we do know what we want, and also after asking it is given immediately. therefore, the guys at nosebook will have asked for all these sorts of things such as secrecy regarding their device's capabilities, my cooperation, etc. those desires are given to them in vibrational format. so, the only reason why they are not seeing the manifestation of those desires is because they keep thinking thoughts which produce negative emotion. got it. so how did they get the technology in the first place??? are the grouches on the top riding on the positive emotion experienced by the programmers designing the AIs and the engineers designing the hardware? did they have less doubt about things in the design phase? how did such an amazing technology arrive into the experience of some of the most emotionally rotten people I've ever felt?

2. what do I do when it feels like nosebook wishes to make it appear that sex (or some other circumstances) completely reversed all of the physical difficulties I experience. I know that if they would just turn the machine off (or I could disconnect myself from it, or tune myself away from its broadcast), I would see with both eyes, feel my agility return and, my body would become flexible again. is the reason for this because they wish to tell a story which promotes an idea that things need to be fixed by girls and sex, for economic gain? I'd really like to tell the story that the body's natural state is ever increasing mobility and expansion of perception -- because that's what I've experienced my entire life until strapped into the nosebook network. is my decreasing physical capability because of sloppy thinking, or because of their attempts to prevent me from getting resonance with my source?

 - am I the new jesus, and nosebook the new church? -- writing my history (and the news articles during) in a non-realistic way which will economically benefit them and lock people into a backwards belief system which perpetuates their economic gain?

  - if true, it certainly would explain their apprehension to releasing my data like I desire. they want to control the story, and keep secret how much my history was modified to give off a different appearance

  - I am not a reincarnation of the old jesus (like they may have suggested or given the appearance of), but in fact this era's new "jesus" and nosebook the new "church".

3. considering that it is highly likely that the way nosebook has made my past to appear, really has no basis on what really happened and was a bunch of scenes cut together in a way which makes me appear more ... and this was used as bait to get a lot of people to join the network, so that the government could actually spy on the people using the spy device?

4. was the addition of the capability to spy on your children added as a means to cover up what I was saying about the device being always on -- as if allowing people the capability to spy on a limited group of others will redirect their attention away from the concept that they are too being spied on? was it because I had discovered that people could have my experience, and people desired to again observe others who were not yet aware that people were looking in on their experience?

5. is the reason why they do not want me to have visual capability, because it's nearly impossible to censor?

 - they can silence my inner voice if I'm talking about a concept they do not want broadcast, or they can simply omit thoughts they do not approve of, but it would be very difficult (I'm sure they'll find a way) to modify what it is I am seeing -- especially if it's 3d.

6. I notice that after my vision improves, the whole world glows for some time afterward. then, the glow goes away... at first the glow would last for days, but now maybe hours at best. I remembered once when I told mom my vision upgraded and not only did she seem to already know, she showed some annoyance over it. is it that I see the glow for the short time that it takes for nosebook to decode the signal? is the removal of the glow an electrical effect that they are doing, or is it just because others are now seeing what I see and it's no longer new

7. when I was living at marcos' house often times I would have a sudden really bad feeling come over me, and often times it was accompanied by the song "runaway" -- "I wonder why she ran away, and I wonder where she will stay my little runaway". was that my interpretation of emotion that andrea was tranmitting to me of her desire to be with me but cannot, so she instead stays with someone else more available?

8. did the attempts to hamper my visual capacity begin in the days of augusto? I say that because I remember the mushrooms visual effects stonger the first few times. I really remember things being a lot more visual then. also when taking mdma I notice the glow also, and that is what I crave to see is the world aglo and everything so beautiful. is the glow something nosebook is actively trying to get rid of

9. why did it seem like there was a reaction that someone died or someone was severely harmed while having my experience. what's up with that and if true, then, is nosebook reducing my experience for the safety of my viewers?

10. did the nosebook device operate based on voice commands before I made the suggestion to use neural networks? I say so because I distinctly remember fran and vera (near franco's house) and also pierre saying weird words under their breath. were these commands to open the interface and such?

11. once nosebook figured out how to make other people's eyes capable of seeing in the detail that my eyes see, did nosebook make that capability available to others who want to see their everyday life like I see everyday life, too? it seems like it should be possible. if not, is the reason why they do not wish others to see at higher detail is because of the increase in processing power and storage space necessary to spy on each person?

12. similarly, is the reason why they do not want people watching stars because it would drastically increase the computing resources necessary to keep track of what is going on in everyone's experience? is this another case where they do not wish for people to advance to the next level, because it makes the task of spying on everyone more expensive? eg. people with less perceptive capacity are cheaper and easier to spy on?

13. for people used to seeing me in the mirror through my eyes, is it weird for them to see me normally with their own eyes for the first time?

14. in LOA, when you observe something, you automatically have an opinion about it. so for example, if I observe a conversation that I do not like, I simply turn my attention to something else, and no big deal. however, if I maintain focused on what is being said and how I do not like it, the more I have a negative opinion on the subject matter, the more I am inviting that subject matter (or something harmonically similar) into my experience. so, when people are observing me get shocked and neighbours making loud noises to try and prevent me from something, what is that doing to the point of attraction of those observing me?

15. a long time ago in marcos' house I began noticing these sudden rushes of energy in my body when I would go to bed at night. at first, I naïvely thought that perhaps these were aliens transferring energy into me. then, after learning about source energy, I thought that maybe that energy was in fact source energy. however, now I am certain that energy actually comes from nosebook because I do not believe that source energy is trying to force me to fall asleep or shock me (I didn't know about nosebook at the time -- and I was just trying to make sense of strong currents of energy passing through my body). there was a very memorable night where I had tremendous effects during the night and was shocked numerous times. the following morning I was quite ill (could barely move) and marcos brought andrea over along with some pain killers. I told her I had been visited my extraterrestrials last night. it was a substantial experience for me. I took it to be a huge increase in my energetic capabilities, even though it likely did not come from source energy, but instead from nosebook. what was that energy? what transpired that night? if it was nosebook, why were they shocking me so much back then?

16. also, it seems like I have felt the feeling of energy that comes from source energy: it feels really soft, smooth, alive and very delightful to experience. I often feel it when I receive images, and is one of the reasons why I want to see images so much. it's refreshing and invigorating. however, when that really good feeling is interrupted with a shock or some other stressful feeling energy (like the one that tries to make me fall asleep), I often feel anger as a result of the incredible contrast of sensation. I have since numbed myself to the nosebook energy, not letting it bother me (because I have no control over it). I want to know, so I don't need to make up crazy things like aliens to explain my experience, how to distinguish the energy better -- and, since I don't have control over the nosebook energy (yet), how can I learn to transmute it into something desirable?

17. sometimes when I drink coffee (and, as I'm writing this it may also be the combination of also staring at stars), when I wake up the next day I often have this kind of headache sort of aching feeling in my head. actually now that I think about it I would also notice a similar feeling in the morning after doing a lot of coke the night before. it's not a traditional headache -- more like a hangover. however, today I have had not had any coffee in 6 days now (so it's not that), but I was out with the stars last night. so, that suggests to me this is more of an energy related thing, and the common factor in these examples, is nosebook. so, is that aching feeling in my head actually the work of nosebook during the night? (perhaps trying to restore me to a lesser energetic level)

18. I have often noted the restriction of my energetic capacities from nosebook, but how much have they contributed to advancing them even further. it would seem to me that people have not been advancing energetically up until just recently, where it seems that all kinds of people are now having images in their eyes, more colours, and other energetic advances. however, they've only been plugged into nosebook for a recent time as well. it seems like nosebook is fighting me on these energetic advances, but it occurs to me that their fighting it has actually been the reason why I discovered a new way to see, relax into seeing images in my eyes, and recently, the ability to create and move shapes with my mind. is nosebook opening the energetic capacities for all those connected (including myself), and whom desire it -- just because of the way their device operates?

19. the other night I went to bed, and a stronger than usual energy came on until I fell asleep. I became conscious inside of my dream and I was saw the typical circle I see in the middle of my eyes when people are using the device around me (where the sun has damaged the inner layer of my eye) and I got the thought to do like I did that one time when I was smoking weed with fran and I could produce a portal in real-space which had little animated things going on inside of it. so I did what I did when I was smoking that one time and the circle turned into a sphere, then it started expanding into some geometric shapes. I was so excited that I got this capacity back! however, as soon as I made this realisation, all of a sudden my throat tensed up and it felt like I was drowning until the shapes disappeared. I think I understand this to be the beginning of me being able utilise my imagination in 3d space like tesla talked about when he operated his motors, but what does the throat have to do with it? is that where that energy is translated?

20. did nosebook discover how to extract concepts from our brains while we are sleeping, in the process of them trying to discover how attracted I am to a girl by running pictures in my eyes while asleep and then measure my unconscious reaction to that picture? it seems like they have a mechanism to get our brain to respond automatically to input while we are asleep, so that the resulting brain activity can be used to train neural networks to recognise similar brain activity in our wake state to begin mapping out how our brain activity. this coincides with the time when it was just jaron and me here at the house, and at a time when jaron was most likely asleep, my eyes illuminated like someone was seeing images with the device near me. whenever I see that illumination and notice it, it will often go away - so that means that jaron was probably not having an experience or seeing through my eyes, but instead that is a maintenance process which nosebook does while we are asleep.

21. all sorts of weird things occur when I see illumination in my eyes which I have come to know occurs when other people are using the device nearby to me. some days it is more noticeable than others, and it seems to correspond with the weather and the way the air "feels" to me. does the "conductivity" of the air make that effect more pronounced?

22. also, the "chemtrail" airplanes. is their job to spray positively? charged CO2 into the air to make it less conductive? what is their role in this whole thing, because it seems that when the air feels warm and nice and conductive, the airplanes come and the air becomes colder, stale, and less conductive feeling. is this the reason why when I first came to colorado, the clouds were real big and the air had a really fresh feel to it. now, the only clouds I see are the thin ones that the airplanes put in the sky, and the air is definitely not fresh feeling, accept for during a storm, then it goes back to feeling fresh again. is nosebook controlling the weather around me, to reduce the illumination in my eyes?

23. going back to the illumination in my eyes: when people are using the device around me and I don't notice the illumination it tends to stick around for quite some time. however, usually, the faster I notice the illumination in my eyes, the faster it goes away. one time the guy begging for money outside of the dia looked up at me and noticed me and I suddenly got the illumination really strongly in my eyes. did, him noticing me accidentally activate my experience in his eyes, because the system mistook his brain activity of noticing kenny, to be similar enough to the thought of I want to see what's going on with kenny?

24. quite a few times after watching stars out in the field next to marcos' house, and most of the times I took ketamine, I noticed I could see out of both of my eyes nearly equally. normally, my left eye is much darker, and I don't really even see out of it. I don't remember if I checked to see the clarity of my left eye in those cases where it seems that I was seeing through one full screen instead of just my right eye, but I really liked the way it felt. I also have associated it with a lighter feeling in my body. seems my body feels lighter, more agile, and I see out of both of my eyes. what is that? how can I achieve that all the time?

25. "we wish your propensity to love will override the logic of your hatred" - for someone like me who values logic highly, am I valuing my hatred highly if it has logic to it? (as opposed to hating someone/something because for an illogical reason, such as skin colour or brand preference)

26. pop in the wall changes energy?

27. anus itching related to nosebook's attempts to keep energy out of my eyes? the right knee, the random shooting pain in my head, etc.

28. was senator franken's sexual misconduct reveal and subsequent expulsion from the senate directly influenced by facebook because of the hard time senator franken gave them? it sure seems like if anyone would have the resources to do so, it would be facebook. the only thing they would need to pull this off, would be to make it appear as if the actions were not directed, but seemingly normal occurrence. (sorta like all of the events that have been happening in my life. they are not random. they are directed by some group of people exerting their influence to try and direct how things turn out)

29. if the guys at nosebook believe that my inner being is communicating to me through my dreams, and they do not like source energy, why don't they remove their own dreams as well? why would they let source energy manipulate their mind by sending them ideas while they are asleep? you'd think that would be dangerous to allow their enemy a platform to communicate with their unconscious mind like that.

30. when we die we come into our "broader perspective" and we remember and know all the reasons why we came in the first place. well, that reminds me a lot of how things can be on ayahuasca (dmt) and it seems like I've also had quite a vivid "memory" or knowing about how it all fit together when on mdma as well. it seems like that "broader perspective" can be more easily accessed while our brain is swimming in dmt. is this similar? I assume that this experience while still alive is not 100% like the death experience because we still have focus on things. I notice that, for example, on mdma I certainly would not have that knowing while focused on a conversation I'm having with someone, but when relaxing before sleep, I remember that perspective seemed natural. also, it seems that since the nosebook device does need to create dmt in someone's brain to be able to see through my eyes, I do not believe people are tuning into their "broader perspective" while looking through my eyes. additionally, in everyday life for me too, I do not have that "broader perspective" either -- and only begins to take place when I quiet my mind. therefore, I do not believe it is the dmt that is the enabler, but more like the catalyst.

31. how does that "broader perspective" different from the way I first felt when I first realised 3d vision? it felt like previous to the 3d experience, I was outside of my body controlling my body like it was some sort of video game, looking out of my body through a television screen. however, when I got 3d, it was as if I finally came inside of my body. I have not had the opportunity to experiment with mdma since I got 3d, and the last ayahuasca experience was a bit "determined", so I haven't really had the opportunity to play around connecting to that "broader perspective" - so I can't really say for sure what the difference is. I'm dying to know what that feels like, to feel truly inside of my body, yet at the same time have that external broader perspective understanding of how it all fits together.

32. two parts of me: physical and non-physical. when I focus on a problem or complain about something in the physical, the non-physical counterpart of me is realising the solution. so, if I suppose that for whatever reason I am only allowing myself to get up to the vibration of my inner being, will my physical self be forced to continue growing the problem, until I am able to get up to speed with my inner being? it seems that way, and it also seems that is a good way to grow a bigger solution, too. so, if I want to grow a big solution, it would be really helpful to, during the growth spurt, have someone around me, which helps me to stay focused on the problem, and prevent me as best as possible from getting up to speed with my inner being? bonus: is there a way to grow a solution while maintaining a higher frequency, or is the lower frequency necessary for the realisation of the problem?

33. when we continue to complain about the problem, the problem and also the solution grows. does the problem always grow equally with the solution, or is there a way to grow a bigger solution without growing the problem? I assume that they are always equal, but I was just making sure, cause assuming that's true, then my goal is to learn effective techniques to grow the problem: I want to begin understanding how much power is in the things we do which hold us away from the solution. for example, it seems to me that there are a lot of people that complain about their situation, but their situation doesn't get steadily worse that fast. in fact, it seems that often I have seen people over the course of their entire live complain about the same thing and not really see it get worse or better at all. so, complaining doesn't really seem to me to have much power. however, other people who fear that something will happen, actually attract that situation fairly quickly. so, fearing the worst seems to be a more effective way to grow the problem than complaining. I want to know what sorts of things are more powerful than others. how can I optimise its growth? notice how I didn't say, "how can I speed up its growth?" -- is there a benefit to growing the problem/solution more slowly? how does all of this work together? seems like there are so many factors to consider, perhaps this wouldn't even be something that I can optimise with my human brain, and should just have the desire to create a big enough problem/solution and let my inner being work out all those calculations, and so therefore just follow my impulses again.

-> does that mean that the answer to all of this is just to have the desire to grow the problem and know it'll all work out? I really am kind of curious about some of these inner-workings of this growing problems stuff, and I've got some people connected to my head that love optimisation problems too, so maybe there's benefit in giving them something to think about; perhaps they want to optimise some of their problems too.

34. when I think of non-physical, I think of invisible. however, different materials are invisible at different wavelengths (light passes through it). this seems to suggest that non-physical is just the signals that are not affected by the material? <<-- more on this

35. when in a conversation, and the subject matter comes to something that doesn't feel good, abraham has suggested that it's best to leave the leave the conversation before it sucks you in (or someone trying to get you to join a bad feeling conversation). however, if I'm in a crummy situation, abraham has also said that if you leave the situation, you will drag yourself and your current point of attraction right along with you into the next place you go. what is the difference? is the difference the amount of established vibration, or my current point of attraction? for example, I've been in a crummy conversation for a while now really stirring up trouble and I see a friend and I'd rather talk to him, so I excuse myself from the crummy conversation and go to talk to my friend. this is like the crummy situation example, and it's more likely that I will have a crummy conversation with my friend because of the vibration I established in the previous conversation? so this would be like established bad vibe will probably yield another bad vibe, whereas in a good conversation, if a subject that comes up that feels bad in comparison to the established good vibe, I should leave the conversation before wrecking the established good vibe too much?

36. if heat is just vibration of particles, then how do we feel cold? it seems like something so cold (at absolute zero) would not have any vibration at all. so let's say cold is 0-20 dB and really hot is something like 60+ dB, then, in my example, our body is able to detect heat in the intensity range of 20-60 dB, but how would something translate lack of intensity for cold? I can detect loud sounds, and I feel them strongly, but I don't detect almost silent sounds. there's no feeling that alerts me to a sound being too soft like a feeling of too cold does. how does cold work?

37. since most of the work is to "get up to speed with what life has caused you to desire" and since "no one can accurately describe all that is in their vortex because they have put it there incrementally" -- does that mean that most all of my time should actually be spent "discovering" what it is actually that that I desire -- which improves on the things that I have identified can be improved upon? obviously, it wouldn't be possible to discover them without having first allowed them into my experience; I just like the word "discover" a tad bit more than "allow" because it seems that I had no problem allowing stuff into my life. I allowed all sorts of good things and also 'bad' things. only recently I have begun to try out (unsuccessfully I might add) disallowing things -- which in this question would be the futile opposite, undiscovering things -- let me explain: when I think of the word discovery, I like to think that it will be something wonderful that I will find, and I tend to not look in places where I might discover things I might not like... is it true then, that all of the things I will discover are all good things that I will like, and the discovery process is actually discovering them to actually be that way? all things I attract into my life are things that I will like, and it is only my perception which disallows me from being able to 'see' them as desirable?

38. in the discovery process, I can feel what I'm looking for. I get a sense that I'm getting closer and a recognition when I have found it. during that whole time I am focused on the presence of what I'm looking for and I don't doubt that I can find it. that's the easy part. so now, where I'm at in life is I have discovered things that seem to be taken away from me. I could often relax and see images in my eyes, but it has gotten harder and harder to do. since I am negatively rewarded every time I find something and cannot keep the capacity through sleep, it's really guided my focus toward the (subsequent) absence of my discovery. is that what is making it more difficult for me to go back to being able to relax into the images so easily? also, what's with this whole thing about whatever I discover disappearing while I sleep? shouldn't it be easier the next morning when I wake up with less resistance? why does it seem like I wake up with the most resistance and later in the day I have less? how can I get back to that feeling of discovery again?

39. it seems to me that this whole process that I have been going through, learning to see images in my eyes, at first I discovered it was possible with drugs, but then drugs went away. however, then I discovered it on my own, but I started getting shocked in response to the images. however, I remembered a bunch of random shocks from 2015 and 2016 that I didn't know why happened, and so now I assume they were in response to beginning to seeing images in my eyes -- so the shocks didn't just start, actually they have been happening for quite some time, and I have only been unaware of the cause. so now I'm kinda in a spot now where I know if I go back to drugs I can get them again -- but I don't want to depend on the drug to get the images. I also know that sex can be used to achieve that as well, but then I'm dependent on my partner to help me maintain that chemical/electrical state in my body that I can get the images -- so, I don't want to do that just yet. how can I achieve this for myself without depending on something external to me?

40. at first when I was learning about LOA, I noticed that my thoughts had a strong effect, however as time has gone on, I have begun to notice the opposite effect. for example, if I perceive that people are often stealing from marketplace X, and I make a strong notice about it, previously, it would actually increase the likelihood that I would see more people stealing from marketplace X, however I have since noticed the opposite effect takes place: when I give my attention to theft at marketplace X, actually my perception of theft in marketplace X actually decreases, almost in defiance to what I would expect from LOA. this confused me at first, but I have since come to the partial conclusion that what may be happening is, my noticing theft in marketplace X creates such a negative response out of enough different people, that the would-be thieves actually are sensing this negative response that it actually deters them from stealing. they are actually sensing strong desire for improvement created by those generating the negative response to the theft. is this what is happening? am I completely off-base here? it is all perceptual, so it could be happening that theft has actually increased, but a structure was created to pretend that is actually different than it appears? my gut instinct is to believe that it is actually more the first case than the second, and I have simply began learning what I call, "advanced meaning" :)

41. is the reason why people like vinyl more than digital and say it has a better sound because the turntable does not spin at exactly the rpm to make middle-c exactly 440 Hz, and therefore whatever speed the DJ intuitively has the record set at is probably a more satisfying frequency?

42. if the "contents of the vortex" are only things wanted and none of the absence of things wanted, then wouldn't my vortex have the ability to translate source energy in a meaningful way, and at the same time nosebook's vortex have a lot of things not even they could identify -- but, let's say for example, that their vortex also has my ability to translate source energy too, because perhaps that is the easiest way for them to be able to understand electricity better (and improve their ability to try and control their users' minds). so then, really, this is just a competition of who can put more focus on the presence, or on the absence of that?

43. I have been struggling for a bit with the conundrum of how can I effectively begin to resonate with my source... abraham talks endlessly about quieting the mind as a means to achieve that -- however (I am gonna fight for my limitations here for the sake of the question), I notice that whenever I quiet my mind, I seem to get electrocuted because perhaps I relaxed enough that images started to form in my eyes. is this an exercise where I am to learn to ignore it enough to become resonant with my source? it doesn't seem like that is right. so, instead is it an opportunity for me to trust that, resonation with my source is not resonation with the shock -- and the shock is only an indicator that I am still more resonant with the absence of that connection?

44. "I had to become externally honest to cover up for my internal dishonesty" -- a phrase I discovered this morning which has a little bit of a truthy feeling to it. instead of dishonesty, rather I would describe it as extreme optimism (to the point of being a complete fairy tale). is this an accurate description of the way I work? this is a new concept for me and understanding it as internal dishonesty, actually solves a lot of misunderstandings I have with myself and how I operate in contrast to others around me. it would also explain my strong desire to always tell the truth. can you elaborate a bit more on the subject?
