Form</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Part I: the Magical Heart&nbsp;</font></font></b></center>
<font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">by Kathy (Kay) Williams</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">I am one who has been peripherally
aware of the term, sacred geometry, but couldn't quite figure what to make
of it. So what, I thought, if this form fits into that one in a mathematical
way. So what? And I was dubious about spiritual meanings, seemingly arbitrarily
assigned to geometric forms. I had put the notion of sacred geometry over
there, (out there), not really relevant at this moment.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Well, after learning about Frank
Chester's take on a particular geometric form, the heptahedron (a seven-sided
form), my attitude isn't "so what?" anymore. Now, its "so . . . wonderful!"</font></font>
</p><p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/frank1.jpg" height="190" width="178" align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Frank
Chester is an educator and sculptor who took it upon himself to investigate
the seven-sided form. His line of inquiry started with pondering this motif,
one of seven seals that Rudolf Steiner designed.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Mr. Chester wanted to take this two-dimensional
seven-sided image and make it three-dimensional. He thought about what
it would be as a platonic form. Not satisfied by the existing models for
what a seven- sided form would look like, he tinkered with clay and string
and straws and wire and paper and bubbles and whatever models he could
make, until he discovered a shape more simple and elegant than any presented
before. The implications of his discovery of this heptahedron affect notions
in mathematics, geology, architecture, medicine, and more; much more than
is touched upon by this article.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">This shape has seven sides: each
side has exactly the same surface area. There are four equal triangles
and three equal four-sided shapes that look like kites. In the picture
(below left) of his cardboard model, you see one of the triangles, and
two of the kite-shaped sides. Mr. Chester has found that he can draw all
the surfaces of this shape, flattened, by using two sizes of circles; the
arc tracings on the sides of this model show the remnants of that drawing
process. The relationship between the size of the two circles is the Golden
Mean, a ratio that artists and scientists have found governs many natural
items such as the proportions of a leaf or of the human body.</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/saturn-x.jpg" height="165" width="121"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/edgesonly.jpg" height="164" width="169"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The next model (above, right) of
the heptahedron, which he has named the “chestahedron,” shows edges only.
Mr. Chester did all kinds of things with his model to discover wherever
it might lead him. He was curious about the sacred geometry relationships;
in particular, how platonic forms fit inside each other. He found that
the heptahedron fits inside a cube with its axis at 36 degrees.</font></font>
</p><p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/small-in-cube.jpg" height="176" width="180" align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The
angle of 36 degrees was noteworthy to Mr. Chester because he remembered
that the human heart sits at that particular angle inside of a person's
chest. Various theories have been presented as to why the heart sits at
this angle—but none very satisfactorily. Does it have to do with the earth's
tilt? Since the earth's tilt is only about 23 degrees, not so likely.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">One of the things he did was to dip
the edges-only model into soapy liquid and then blow air into it through
a straw to make a bubble, a process which rounds all the lines and surfaces,
making the shape organic. Frank Chester compared his rounded seven-sided
shape with a drawing he found on the web of the left and right ventricles
of the heart. The right ventricle fits around the left ventricle.</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/bubblesmall.jpg" height="216" width="154"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/likeheart.jpg" height="217" width="262"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Mr. Chester had the idea of putting
his rounded seven-sided shape on its axis into a vortex generator, a tank
of spinning water. If he put the shape in straight down, the original vortex
is undisturbed. But when he puts the shape in at the angle of 36 degrees
and keeps it spinning with an electric drill, the shape of the first swirl
of water is changed. It forms a sort of pocket on the side. Mr. Chester
made a model of what he saw in that interaction, cut a cross section of
that model, and sure enough, it looks just like a dissection of the human
heart.</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/frank8.jpg" height="221" width="507"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Inspired by a drawing made by Rudolf
Steiner, Frank Chester has followed the path of curiosity and experimentation
until it led to a 3-D demonstration of the formative forces at work, creating
the asymmetrical shape of flesh that is the human heart. The manifest implication
is that the formative forces that actually build the flesh of the heart
are engaged as swirl, contained in shape and direction by the geometric
form.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The heart is not a pump. Instead,
the heart is a streaming device, and in the left ventricle, the spin of
fluid is captured and twirled back on itself. In this way, the heart acts
as a brake. The prime reason for this braking is balance. The heart is
a balancing organ.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The idea that the heart is a pump
has dominated medicine for centuries. Yet at the apex of the left ventricle
of the heart, the bottom point, the tissue is paper thin, not strong enough
to enclose fluid under pressure. With the vortex model for understanding
the motion of blood within the heart, one can see how this part of the
heart never receives dangerous pressure, which it would, if the heart were
indeed a pump. Other researchers have been able to show with cameras that
the blood courses through the blood vessels of the human embryo, before
the heart is even formed. Something else is moving the blood. This is another
reason Frank Chester believes that the heart is not a pump.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">He has found that the heart is a
streaming organ that is itself formed by a reversing, swirling stream.
The blood enters the left ventricle in a clockwise spiral. By the time
it moves out of the left ventricle, it is spinning in a counterclockwise
motion. It reverses direction inside of the left chamber.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">This thought is of interest to me
because it is my practice to bring my awareness to the space that is my
heart as a meditative practice. When I align my kinesthetic awareness of
my own heart-space with these new images of how my physical heart works,
I feel something new. Chester says there is a moment at the midpoint of
the reversing of flow where the blood actually pauses, no motion. I wonder
if that moment is the essential meaning of my meditation. What if my heart
is a bell, and the still-point is the ringing of that bell?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">If we go back to the edges-only model
of the chestahedron and spin it on its axis, the shape that is displayed
through that motion is like a bell. Rudolf Steiner reported that the evolving
soul, before it becomes living matter as you or as me, is apparent to the
inner eye as the shape of a downward opening bell.</font></font>

<p><a name="end part 1"></a><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The bell
shape has been used in ancient Egyptian paintings to represent the human
soul, coming down to earth from the heavens to incarnate in flesh. These
bell shapes, seeds of spirit, are the geometric templates for growing a
human heart.&nbsp;</font></font>

<br><b><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Part II: the Sentient Earth</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">What I have to tell you is no small
thing. I wish to introduce you to someone - someone who you will really
want to know, and know completely.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Before we start, consider this. In
the Tsunami in 2004, animals did not drown. People drowned, but animals
had made their way uphill before the waves crashed. They didn’t outrun
the waves at the last minute, they were already at safe ground.&nbsp; How
do you think they knew?&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1"><i>I</i> think mother Nature told
them to move, and they heard and took her advice. That’s what I think.
That sounds juvenile, doesn’t it, like a fairy-tale of a theory. Well,
prepare to reconsider.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Because right now, I can present
to your skeptical mind, proof that the Earth is a sentient Being who is
in sync with (us) her children. When we tune in, She can guide us through
the otherwise impossible.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">I can imagine you are thinking, here
we go. Eco-gobbledy goop. So let's say it this way: I can present evidence
that the Earth contains within, an energy field that is exactly the same
shape and energetic pattern as our own human core identity. Mature human
consciousness includes intuition and compassion, and conscience - all of
which resides in the subtle body at the heart.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The human heart we can see is governed
by the subtle energies in the shape that is the Chestahedron, the seven-sided
form. I can show you that same shape also forms the sacred geometry template
for the whole Planet, Earth Herself.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">To witness the proof we must keep
following the path of the intrepid investigator, Frank Chester, who continues
to explore the essence and ramifications of the seven-sided form. Once
again a clue came to Mr. Chester from Rudolf Steiner. The drawing below
was made by Steiner on a chalkboard during a lecture <i>The Forming of
the Earth and the Moon: Causes of Volcanism</i> by Rudolf Steiner (Sept.
18, 1924) about the subtle geometry of the earth, in which he said the
earth contains <i>a sort of tetrahedron</i>, and the points of contact
(written in yellow, in German) are South Pole, Japan, Mid-America and Caucasus.</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/drawing.jpg" border="0" height="228" width="360"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/clearglobe.jpg" border="0" height="229" width="216"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Chester wondered if the Chestahedron
were the right <i>sort of tetrahedron</i> . . . so he had to find out,
testing with a model. Chester found a clear globe showing the continents
of the Earth and fashioned a Chestahedron of right scale to put inside.
See how it matches up - it just fits. The points of the Chestahedron touch
the surface of the Earth in exactly the places Steiner had seen in his
clairvoyant vision. Mid-America turns out to be in Kansas.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The plot thickened for Mr. Chester
when syncronistically, Scientific American printed this cover story about
new ways to investigate the nature of Earth’s core.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/magazinecover.jpg" height="290" width="216"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Seeing this, Chester made his way
to California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA to compare notes
with Jeroen Ritsema, part of a team collecting seismic tomography data,
reported by this magazine.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/hotcoldworld.jpg" height="278" width="432"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">This map produced by seismology imaging
uses blue colorings to represent cool areas, red the warmest, and yellow
in between. Mr. Chester asked Mr. Ritsema “what do these patterns mean?”
Mr. Ritsema shrugged, told Chester that "they had no idea of the meanings
behind this data."&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">With that, Mr Chester compared his
data points and the map produced by Mr. Ritsema. The rounded triangular
tracings are added by Frank Chester, superimposed as how the Chestahedron
fits in the Earth according to Steiner's contact points. Consider the many
correspondences that are there.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Next piece of evidence: it turns
out that tornado alley, so named because that area suffers the highest
incidence of twisters, (map provided by the National Severe Storms Laboratory),
is a tracing of the point of contact where two of these global lines meet
in Mid-America, forming parts of two edges of the Chestahedron form.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/talley.jpg" height="162" width="216"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/tornado-line.jpg" height="168" width="288"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Until now, no one has given any meaningful
theory as to why tornados reliably take a turn to the northeast, as it
were, at Kansas and Nebraska. Tornados have been seen forming a line. The
unseen force that organized this arrangement comes from the edge of the
Chestahedron, which formative power in the Earth follows. The organizing
power that puts them in a line is not atmospheric in origin (coming from
the weather), it is geo-spheric (coming from the earth).&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">As described above in Part 1, the
subtle template underlying the formation of the heart is a 3D shape that
is formed by spinning the angular seven-sided Chestahedron. At the bottom
of the Chestahedron is a triangle; when the whole shape is spun, that triangle
traces a ring, visible at the opening of the&nbsp; inverted bell-shape.
That same proportional ring is visible as the walls of the left ventricle
of the heart, shown in cross section, middle image, below.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/purpletop.jpg" border="0" height="137" width="113"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/ventricle-ring.jpg" height="137" width="153"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/paurora2.jpg" height="137" width="137"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/earthring.jpg" border="0" height="137" width="121"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">It turns out that a matching ring
is also visible on the surface of the Earth. The next two photos, above
right, show the north pole (in the blue photo, at the axis) with the Northern
Lights showing. The two white rings are drawn to show the pattern revealed
to scientists, as yet not explained. Photographic evidence from satellites
have shown that the Aurora Borealis displays light within the confines
of that ring. The Northern Lights show up anywhere within the ring, and
do not cross or flash into center circle. The circle immediately surrounding
the North Pole stays dark, while the Borealis flare up most boldly all
around.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">But look at this picture (below left)
of the Aurora Australis, the lights over Antarctica. The light streams
across at the South Pole, in the center area too. There is an explanation,
using the seven sided form, as to why the Southern Lights show up differently
than the Northern.</font></font>
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/australis.jpg" border="0" height="217" width="220"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/earthcones.jpg" border="0" height="216" width="200"></center>
<font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Frank Chester demonstrates with a set
of clear cones in a globe, (image, above right). Two cones are placed inside
the globe, where the wide ends of the cones are at the top, concentric
circles, describing the same ring that the Aurora Borealis does show us.
The cones are created by extending the northern circles down towards to
the south at the exact angle proscribed by the spinning chestahedron. The
inner cone ends at a point at the South Pole. The outer cone ends at the
wider circle the same size as the South Pole light-show ring, as seen in
the above photo.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">At the South Pole, the energies describe
a point with one circle around. There is no inner ring created by the formative
forces, aligned with the spinning seven-sided shape. There is just open
space at the South Pole, apparently where energy can stream with the same
fervor and flow across the center. Isn't this a remarkable explanation
for why the Southern and Northern Lights display differently?</font></font>
</p><center>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">This is the Planet I want you to
meet.</font></font>
<br><a href="http://www.motherworld.net/shared/2001_295_small_rle_99f.mov"><img src="./Remarkable Chestahedron, Part I_files/halo-planet.jpg" height="240" width="320"></a>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">She has halos.&nbsp;</font></font></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">This is a NASA image spacecraft photo.
(Click the image to see this as a motion picture.) The light is from actual
satellite photos. These are the polar auroras: Aurora Borealis and Aurora
Australis. These visible halos and their shapes, together with the seismology
maps and the points provided by Steiner, provide undeniable proof that
the Chestahedron shape is governing the subtle energies of the Earth planet,
<i>just
as they do our human hearts</i>.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">How odd and completely different
to get my head around this. When I put this together with recently reading
that the heart is actually as much or more of a consciousness-displaying
organ than is the brain, its almost overwhelming to think of what this
means about the actual nature of our Planet.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">The article <a href="http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=395" target="blank">New
Spiritual Awareness in Neurosciences</a> states that thoughts or cognition,
as brain activity, are revealed by MRI as visible tracings of light. Monitors
show that the blood vessels deliver extra blood into that area of the brain
right before the neurons fire. The heart-system knows, before the nerve-system
thinks. HeartMath Institute research shows that connecting with heart-centered
awareness sets up for measurable improvements in intuition and more. I
know from my own experience that when I remember to center my attention
in my heart area, there is a quantum leap in my ability to transcend differences
of opinion with others—far more enjoyably. That is wider intelligence,
the making of love.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Perhaps the raw material of consciousness
isn’t intellect, it is energy. <i>That particular seven-sided construct</i>
of energy ... that is the same stuff our entire planet is made of. That
energy dynamic is the result of the seven-sided spinning template. We cannot
help but be connected in resonance with this identical energy frame.&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">How can we, with integrity, deny
the possibility, nay, <i>probability</i> that the Planetary energy <i>is</i>
a conscious loving Intelligence, which we infinitesimally mimic in our
human heart-Identity?</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Humanity needs to wake up and reconnect
with our Mother. Surely the path there is through awareness at the center
of heart. She is as close as our own Heart.&nbsp;</font></font>
