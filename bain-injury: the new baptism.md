## brain injury :: the new baptism

### survivor vs. thriver (or overcomer)

jaron has a sheet of paper on his desk brainstorming new ideas for what could be called instaed of "brain injury survivor" - he had the word "thrive" down there, and while I see what he's going for with that idea, last night after feelign nick talk about "maintaining" -- I realised that although thrive is a better word, when you don't feel like you're thriving, then the world only makes the feeling worse. I think that's why people identify so well with the word "injury" or "trauma" or maybe even "victim" -- because that perfectly descibes the way they feel, you know.

when maria was talking about maintaining, I kinda blew up a bit (sorry about that!) because I strongly disagree with the idea of maintaining, and I'm kinda even against the idea of "hand holding" even, because in my case I took an almost militaristic approach to my recovery, self-motivated of course. it has become quite obvious to me that not everyone shares the same amount of motivation that I do.

I personally call it desire, because the word "motivation" feels like something external to me is doing the motivating. when the motivation comes from within, I call it "desire". I think that internal motivation is important, but it's difficult to inspire that inside of someone -- especially when that isn't the second-nature to the personality of the person.

---

one of the major things that influenced my recovery, was that mom always said to me that I was a new person now -- but even more importantly than that, prior to the brain injury I had identified a number of things that I found deficient in my personality. I had very little emotional control, and I *really* wanted to learn to program computers.

when I had the brain injury, so many parts of my brain got disabled, I really was a new personality. I had the opportunity to begin anew. I took the opportunity to try my hand at it. the brain is extremely flexible and can reconfigure rather rapidly if you'll let it.

for me, I found that I experienced difficulty moving my left side when I felt stress. I used the example last night that I became quite sensitive, and for example if I noticed that a girl liked me, it stressed me out because I didn't know how to act. it turns out, if I didn't want my left side to be completely ridid and difficult to move, I had to learn how to simply continue on doing whatever I was doing, and not pay attention to their attraction. that was a temporary fix, at the beginning, and allowed me to not be paralised in certain circumstances.

the next step was to, because I began actually liking girls, so now I cared how I acted again -- this time, instead of continuing on as if she wasn't there, or wasn't important, but to actually actuate from the core of me .. from who I really am. if I tried to act in a way that I thought maybe she wanted to see me, again I froze up, and became rigid and paralised.

this next part was the most difficult thing for me to learn, and to be quite honest, it took a lot of drugs, specifically mdma, mushrooms, and weed to finally get a hold of the feeling of just letting myself "flow" -- and I really liked it, because with drugs, espically mdma and mushrooms, this "flow" became really easy. it became almost as if I was outside of my body watching myself interact. I wasn't trying to act any way, or be any certain way. I was simply observing myself in the moment. it was a wonderful feeling -- and even though, I maintained vision through my eyes in the process, what I got addicted to was that feeling.

### why do I say baptism?

water baptism was an old praciice used by crazy individuals to give people a near-death experience. they literally held the person under the water and let the person begin to feel as if they're drowning. the baptist isn't going to let them literally drown, but to simulate the experience of being so close to death that you really desire to live.

in the process of coming that close to death, you gain a new desire to live life. this is what happened to me when I had a brain injury. I came back with a renewed sense of desire to want to live and to experience things in a new way (the old me was depressed and emotionally repressed).

in the wake of the near-death experience, the person being baptised (or "surviving" a brain injury) comes back a new person with a new perspective on reality.

### what about "traumatic rebirth"?

one of the things that I like about the idea of being reborn or having a traumatic rebirth is that it doesn't need to apply to only brain injury survivors or anything like that. it could be anything really. it could be anything from a brain injury, to psychotic episode or even the loss of an apendage.

it also sets the frame to letting the survivor know that they are a new person and will have to tackle reality now from an entirely new perspective.

sincererly,
kenny
