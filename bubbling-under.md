# bubbling under

I woke up this morning thinking about this concept. the term "bubbling under" was something that my mom used to describe amorina. so, what is it and what makes a child bubble under like that? I was reminded of two very clear examples of this very thing happening and I will attempt to try and describe what I think is happening.

the two examples that popped into my head was andrea and myself, and you will be able to see what I mean as I explain. I think that children build up such powerful desire when they are young. the desire feels good to them early on. they know it's just a matter of time before they will be realised. there also might be some adjustments that need to be made as we become clearer and clearer about what it is we really want. that's all a part of the process though.

so let's l

the "adult" forces the child to become aware of "reality". the child persists for some time feeling good about the desire. the bubbling under happens when the child begins to make the decision that the child will now begin to feel bad about their own desire just like the adult does. you see, the desire doesn't change. only how the child feels about it changes. if the child were able to maintain feeling good about what they want, knowing that it is in the process of becoming, then it will eventually come about -- and it'll come about in a way that is more of what they really wanted, not less.

it is a difficult thing though when others are trying to convince you with words and action that what you want is not possible. "fine, I'll feel bad about my desire now, and trying to go in the direction of it, while I feel bad will only further separate me from what I want." "you like me (as a child) to be able to continue feeling good about the things that you say are not possible. in fact, I will try out feeling bad about the things I desire until you realise that you liked me better when I wasn't so convinced of what you call, 'the real world.'"

it may not come about exactly like originally imagined to be either. it may not be with the same person or exactly the same circumstance, but it'll be similar, and actually better than originally imagined.

let's say you find me attractive. it might be possible that you are attracted to what it is that I know, and you find me attractive because your inner being knows that I am the path of least resistance to figuring that out. [...]

take for example raquel: she found me attractive in a physical sense, that she thought that I could provide for her in the ways that she thought were necessary to have a good relationship. however, I was really her path of least resistance to finding out that no person can satisfy you in the same way that your inner being can. likewise, she was very attractive to me because she was my path of least resistance to knowing that one cannot perform in enough ways to satisfy another person; that satisfaction only comes from within.

now, take that example as a simile of what is happening with nosebook. can you figure out what nosebook is providing as my path of least resistance to realise X? what do you think I am the path of least resistance for nosebook to realise Y (besides me being the path of least resistance for them to easily fill their network with all of your brains)

consider of the paradox of two conflicting desires: to be happy, and to figure out a way to get back at someone.

both of those exist at the same time (along with many others), but why does your mind generate happy thoughts sometimes and other times generate thoughts of revenge?

I believe that it is momentum. in a moment of feeling revenge, you do still want to be happy, but the thoughts of revenge are much stronger. I noticed that some time ago, my desire to be happy was so strong, that virtually no situation formed a strong enough negative desire for me to change lanes. this is kind of how I see children. they bounce right back to being happy very quickly. eventually, I got worn down though, and like most children, I think this happens as the child is trained to feel bad about their positive desire or good about their negative desire. at some point in time (around adolescence), I think the child kind of says, "I'm tired of trying to feel good about what I desire that I cannot have, I will begin feeling bad about this thing that I want."

... a desire is any thing that we think will make us feel better ... so, when feeling good about a negative desire
