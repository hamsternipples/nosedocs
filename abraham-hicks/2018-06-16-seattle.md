#### context

after a few days where my visual capacity began to be utilisable (and I even had a few visions), they decided to clamp down on that, and as a result, I began feeling worse and worse. I guess my great realisation was a good one, but if it were to have been implemented immediately, it would have been probably too fast. the idea needed more energy.

this came at the same time as having some pretty major vision improvements, which also garnered impressive attempts to control the weather and some new very significant loud new sounds in my head. obviously now, I feeling quite a bit worse again, so I came up with new creative ways of transforming my perception in real-time, as to not let all the new energy that's flowing through me (cause I have less resistance, so more amps) come out through an unproductive perception such as anger or frustration.

other notable things were various groundbreaking emails sent to babel. (reminder: you can use those emails also as another source of context). there are some moments (like earlier today) where everything feels distant, unreachable and like the longest waiting game ever. then, other times I have a really strong sense of a growing connection with lyia.

I suppose I have come to "peace" with where I am. there may be a fair bit of depression, because I'm really struggling to program anything. I'm having a difficult time conceptualising anything right now, and anything creative feels difficult and not quite right. I never get to that place where I have the concept. I know what I'm making; I just need to write the code.

on that subject, I'm having a hard time feeling anything at all. I am considering to go back to sleeping with the headphones for a bit so I can get started on some programming again. also later today I had a realisation that I might be able to work something out with a sponsor so I can have a little bit of money so I can purchase the things I feel necessary to still have a creative output while I'm waiting for these guys to figure their stuff out. I don't really know what to do really. I'm literally sitting around all day, and I'm so close to making some really great new web ideas come into being, but I can't feel good enough for it to happen naturally.
