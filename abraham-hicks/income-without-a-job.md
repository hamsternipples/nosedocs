I was thinking about this very conversation this morning. I'm glad you uploaded it to remind me :)

I understand there is a link between the pressure of time shortage in this conversation and what's happening in my life, but I cannot accurately identify what is the "shortage" or limitation that I feel is being imposed on me is, and neither do I have enough information to identify what beliefs "the people at my work" hold which are "grounding" me.

it feels like I keep losing sensitivity on a daily basis, becoming more and more disconnected from my inner being and most everything is a reaction to that feeling of disconnection. I have never in my life ever felt so disconnected as I do now, and yet at the same time it feels like I'm right on the cusp of becoming more connected than ever before. the things that I wanted to be doing with my life to obtain that connection, I feel, are being kept just out of arm's reach. I know they're on their way, so that's not *that* big of a deal to me -- so I guess it's the sensitivity because I do not feel the constant emotional guidance I have been so accustomed to feeling all my life. it feels like I do not have an accurate way of guiding myself, and that's the main problem.. I know it's all coming but if I have no way of detecting its proximity to me, I feel I cannot navigate accurately toward it.

all of this comes from a sense of instability, however I do trust my emotion well over anything or anyone else, and can identify directions that do not feel good to me -- or is it my perception of the direction that doesn't feel good to me? I don't know. for the rest of things (including ones that previously brought me much joy), I now cannot feel much more than a muffled sense of frustration and pain, so everything is pretty obviously in "hell no" territory. some days though (can't figure out the pattern), all of a sudden the light turns on and I feel good and my creativity begins to flow, but then I begin to receive images and then subsequently I get shocked. I got over the shocking bit; it doesn't really even bother me anymore (happened twice today even), but it just keeps escalating. last time one of those brief spurts of creativity ended with my right ear hearing at half volume and a loud whirring in my head. it has since transformed into something different, but I'm really not super excited about anything.

the guy in the conversation wants to find a job somewhere else to which abraham replies by calling him a lazy creator. I get it that no matter where I go I take myself with me. I'm the guy who was telling people in spain that there is a difference of opinion over my ability to use my visual capacity and whether I stay in spain or go to the states that problem will continue to exist. there is no escaping this job for me. I cannot "go somewhere else" -- other than to commit suicide and finally feel that connection with my inner being like I crave so much here on earth... since I've got these guys stuck inside my head, I'm very aware that I do *literally* take my problems with me wherever I go.

so, that being said, I can emotionally identify things that do not feel good to me, but there is no indication how I can begin to move in the direction of things that feel good to me, because of the shocks and ... stuff. then, there have been multiple occasions where I have received ideas that felt good to me (but not really emotionally good, just physically good) so I don't really trust a lot of what I feel. I'm still really good at getting impulses to go read something or write something or ... and it even feels like I have on occasion received impulses to do things which some may consider violent or negligent. I don't really know what's up anymore.

I gave more thought to the problem presented yesterday, "what is it that they believe that is grounding me" I woke up this morning with an idea that maybe they do not believe source energy exists. the reason why I never gave that idea credence is because logically it doesn't check out at all:

1st. there is no way they are spending as much resources as they are on something that they do not believe exists. you don't see them mounting such a concerted effort to try and keep bigfoot or the boogie monster off of their network. as far as I know, they are not in the business of trying to mitigate empty threats. IMO, they clearly see source energy as a very *real* threat.

2nd. from their perspective, surely they do not honestly think that my game plan is is flail about looking for a change in perception, biding my time, waiting for the moment when I am able to control the images in my eyes, to pretend it's source energy by concisely illustrating my situation in succinct way which allows me to change my perception. lol!

3rd. they have access to esther's experience. those things that abraham says like, "when your desire is strong, you light up for esther". well, they can check that; they can look through her eyes and see if it's true or not. we cannot, so we just take them at their word and believe them blindly because it feels authentic enough to us, or the quantity of other things they have said which our life experience has verified to be true, lends us to believe them.. however, they have the luxury of actually seeing it electronically. it's even likely that they train their AIs with esther's brain signals to be able to alert when abraham-like energy is flowing through mine and to prevent this energy they do not believe in from also flowing through me -- by making lots of noise, then if that doesn't work just shocking me, lol.

we know they've been to the gatherings too, because there was this one time this guy got into the hot seat and was so excited, he said, "omg ... who wouldn't want to be here!" and abraham replied, "he doesn't. (assume they point) he doesn't want to be here." I know of no reasons why someone would show up to a gathering who does not want to be there *AND* be publicly shamed by abraham, unless he was in fact a govt. agent investigating.. so they've done their homework I'm sure. it has to all check out too, because if there were a way to discredit esther for being phony, they would have made sure it was well known, I'm sure. perhaps it's a very real thing, but since it's something they cannot control, they're trying to fight against it.. something still rings true to the idea they they do not believe it exists, though... I don't get it.

I just cannot imagine them having literally all the evidence they could possibly need to know it's a thing and yet *still* believe that it doesn't exist. they are literally fighting against something they do not believe exists. it'd be like them making a concerted effort to ensure that I never talked about the boogie monster. absolutely ludicrous. up until now I had thought of craziness as fighting against something you misidentified (like don quijote fighting windmill dragons), but after the reactions this morning to my idea I am beginning to believe this might in fact the case. they are likely fighting against something they do not actually believe is real

HAHHAAHAHHAHAHHHAHHHAAHAHAHHHAHHAHAHHAHA! omg hang on a moment, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! what a bunch of tools!! anyway, now all this makes total sense to me now!! let's fight against source energy and make it bigger!! lol, what a great idea!! I'll even fight with them :D

ahem, seriously though ... I'm gonna fight a good fight! we're gonna make the HUGEST problem! you just watch; it's gonna be epic!

thanks for all your reactions and everything! sometimes I just need to kind of talk it through a bit to understand a bit better what's going on. I feel sooooo much more at ease with the whole situation now. it's gonna be all good :)
