we just got back from our visit to caÃ±on city.

#### 6. drugs, relief and satisfaction

###### drugs can give you a spiritual awakening, but you're usually not awake enough to make anything of it.

the obviously implied point here is that you must find relief from the dissatisfaction in order to receive that spiritual awakening. and since that relief from dissatisfaction usually happens because the drug takes away your ability to focus (on what's causing your dissatisfaction). so unfocusing yourself from the problem lets you begin to allow the solutions to form in your mind (the spiritual awakening), but you're too unfocused to conceptualise it in a meaningful way.

this is why I've developed techniques of being these concepts that happen in the unfocused state back to reality (focused state). it is possible to bring back and implement a good portion of the concepts that you can realise in that unfocused, more allowing state. this is why I tend to do drugs alone, rather than with people, because other people will usually distract me from those realisations as we talk about things that only both of us can conceptualise.

that's why a group visionary experience interests me, because it seems that if we can all see the same thing, then we're all going to have a slightly different, and therefore potentially more complete understanding of the same abstract visual seen in 3d space.

###### drugs can provide relief, but they cannot give you satisfaction

satisfaction can only come from feeling the motion toward your vortex (or, better stated: feeling your vortex get closer and closer to you, because your thoughts are in harmony with what's in your vortex).

I have come to understand very clearly that drugs will never help you to close that gap, because they're temporary. drugs are good for discovery purposes, but you have to close that gap with your focus, and drugs hold you in an unfocused state.

#### 7. magic is happening all the time

[...]

#### 8. from fear to satisfaction

"because if you're awake, you're going to be offering a vibration, which is going to be having some vibrational relevance with the emotion and the focus of your inner being."

so, imagine that life has caused a desire in me to be born. let's say it's seeing images in my eyes and things of my imagination in 3d space. so then, the people working inside of my head make sure that I cannot see those images or the objects in 3d space, and I'm constantly in a state of dissatisfaction. satisfaction is identifying a desire and moving in the direction of it. dissatisfaction is when, for whatever reason, I choose to go in the opposite direction of my desire.

"in other words, you just cannot turn that off. you just can't turn that relationship sensor off."

so then, obviously what they try to do is to figure out a way of deactivating the thing that's making me feel bad, but you cannot turn off that relationship sensor. in other words, there will never be a way for me to not see images now and still feel satisfaction. sure, I can use drugs or sex to mask my dissatisfaction by making me feel better in the moment. however, it just means greater contrast between how I felt on the drug (or sex) and the dissatisfaction which now feels more, once that drug wears off.

I had an interesting time living with raquel in this sense, because she had nearly unlimited amount of weed to smoke, and I could bring her to feel physically quite amazing -- yet even still, she had this looming dissatisfaction.

it does not matter how good I can make myself feel in the moment with drugs or sex, if I cannot move in the direction of my desire, I will continue to feel that dissatisfaction in a greater and greater way, causing more and more friction in the relationship. I have to find a way of finding satisfaction.

"so, if you're feeling less than satisfied, it just means you're focused screwy."

they don't want me to unfocus. when I meditate and I a reach that detached (unfocused) state, I used to see images, and then get shocked, so they just run a frequency that keeps my brain active, so it cannot unfocus. same thing happens when I am going to sleep: they don't want me relaxing and unfocusing because then I will see images, so they keep me focused while at the same time slowing my brain down to a speed where they can rip consciousness away from me. they hold me perpetually focused. any time I begin to unfocus to feel relief, they focus me right back.

"we don't mean you don't have justification for focusing there, because maybe something happened and you keep remembering and bringing it forward, and bringing it forward.."

maybe this has something to do with the seeing of my future self that one time, which is why they are working so hard to not allow any visuals into my experience. only thing is, if life has produced that desire in me, I can't avoid it. remember how much pain it caused me when I would try to avoid the idea of a relationship? well, the same thing is occurring with my visual capacity. the more I hold myself away from that, the more dissatisfaction I feel.

"you hold yourself in that chronic place, but it really is a choice you have to start making now"

what I said above, about being perpetually focused in a way which does not allow me to move in the direction of that desire, but it is a choice that I have begun to make. that's why I'm such a big hold out, until I get this visual capacity thing sorted out, I will continue to experience dissatisfaction. there's no other way around it.

---

so, they don't need to find a way of conquering that fear (of talking directly to me about my visual capacity?), they just need to find things to be satisfied about (and there are a lot of them).

"it's not just hard to work against law of attraction; it's impossible"

"it's hard to offer a vibration that is opposite of how my inner being feels, and not feel negative emotion about it. it's not just hard, it's impossible"

---

"first you gotta find relief, then you gatta find satisfaction. then life purpose starts showing up"

#### 10. is he ready to day trade?

"the charts excite me" -> ready
"but I'm afraid" -> not ready
"I need help" -> not ready
"I understand" -> ready
"I need help" -> not ready

"your readiness is all about your in-the-moment emotion, which is what you want to practice first before you turn your attention to this subject"

"does it feel too simplistic when we say, if you feel worried or dissatisfied, in that moment, don't take an action because you're not hooked into any clarity and it probably won't go well.."

"but when you feel truly eager about moving your furniture around, call somebody and move some furniture around and then watch what happens."

---

the imagery they presented of life causing more to be asked, but then you didn't go. then more and you didn't go. I didn't become less satisfied. my inner being became more satisfied.

so, if we take this to mean my visual capacity, and not what everyone thought they were talking about: girls, then that means that life just kept producing more and more desire relative to that subject. back when I was at marcos' house and I was able to watch stars and feel the satisfaction of me moving in the direction of my visual capacity, I was quite satisfied. at that time, marcos was the holdout. but then that changed around the time of the pueblo (when I saw my future self?) when I began to be prevented to move in the direction of my desire.

since then, my desire for my visual capacity has grown so much, that the enormous gap between where I am now and the realisation of that desire (where my inner being is), so so enormous, I experience chronic dissatisfaction. however, I could turn that dissatisfaction into more satisfaction by appreciating more and more things and staying off the visual capacity subject as much as I can. I have been doing exactly that, and as a result, I have noticed marked improvement in the detail of the image I see in my eyes, when it's not blurry. every time I get on the subject of my visual capacity, I have a bit of a meltdown.

so, I'm doing well, as I have been learning to appreciate and find positive aspects in difficult to find positive aspect situations.

#### 12. quick message

"you get so used to the status-quo, that you don't expect something to be different than what you've been getting, even though you want something to be different than what you've been getting"

lol, that's me. I'm so used to things how they are, I don't expect them to ever change. perhaps, I'm even holding others there with my expectation, as well.

in fact, I believe I've nearly achieved perfect alignment with, the "satisfied with what-is" part of the equation, that I'm not really able to conceptualise the "eager for more" part of the equation. I'm sort of used to things constantly becoming less or more difficult than they used to be.

#### 13. a different approach

so what are you eager for...

"you were so sure, when you decided to come into physical form, that you were not going to wait around for others to get you, that you made sure, you were ungettable"

"give up on getting them to get you, because not only do they not want to get you, they want to change you to something they do get" ... "and they think they're calling you forward, but they're really calling you backward"

why won't you change? (because I don't want to) "because I was born to give you an opportunity to not need conditions to be exactly what you think they should be in order to feel good, because a belief in conditions -- a conditional life is one where there can be no motion forward"

lol, so I'm actually giving the bso the opportunity to give up such a conditional life, so they can have even more motion forward :)

"if you're just focused on the conditions that are, nothing new happens"

if you just understand people's brains how they are, and keep them that way, then nothing new happens.

"you have had a magical experience, because you came in knowing so much, and others had to come to understand your different approach, and you magnificently created so many others around you that gave it up pretty early on, and *just let you be*, and that's a tribute to your .. stubbornness and powerful intentionality which is serving you very well"

... lol, I've always said, "just let me be! I will find my own way. I have more confidence in myself than ever, and if you would just stop working against me, everything would work out beautifully"

#### 12. emotions and physical well-being

"everything is an extension of thought, and emotion is an indicator of the extended thought"

"if you have strong negative emotion that is chronic, we sort of have been saying, don't worry it'll get more ... then we've been saying that physical pain is just physical negative emotion that wasn't turned around, and so it became more"

"if you've figured out how to become physically stronger and feeling better, then you've figured the other out too, and you're just not giving yourself credit for it -- because the physical situation does follow the emotional situation"

#### 13. uplifting others and inspired action

"there's only receiving"

"you've been giving and giving and giving, but unless you're receiving and receiving and receiving, you've got nothing to give"

"isn't it nice when others are *asking* and you can be one of the cooperative components"

this speaks to these uplifters in my dream-state that are trying to help me out with things I'm not asking help for. I think one of the reason why I'm not asking for help is because I don't see it as a problem.

I will propose an idea here: life has you ask, and you do it all day, without even really knowing it. but when you those little "asks" accumulate enough that you become aware of it, then you can put all of those little "asks" together and formulate a question. so, until a question has formed, it's kind of hard to uplift someone who has not yet formulated the question.

think about it like a cantankerous little kid (like me): if you come over and tell them the answer to some problem they're trying to solve, it will frustrate them. it isn't until they come asking for help, that you can really do anything other than annoy them.

#### 17. simplicity and feeling overwhelmed

when they're speaking of more detailed and more faceted, they must be referring to the signal that is in my brain when they were meditating me.

"it starts simply but then it becomes more complex. but, because you're in sync with it, it never becomes overwhelming and so it becomes so detailed, and so faceted; so multi-faceted, but your ability to comprehend it stays right up with it"

"humans want to equate faceted, complicated, and more detailed with overwhelming, but when you stay up to speed with it, it feels simple all along the way"

so, probably my brain is giving off a more and more detailed signal all of the time, and the people trying to use my creative capacity at this detail level are feeling a bit overwhelmed. lol, they're just going to have to figure out how to stay up to speed with it.

she then says she feels her stream is moving so fast it feels overwhelming..

"well, that's because it got a little bit of a head start on you, and you're kind of standing still in some beliefs that aren't serving you"

I didn't have that much of a head start.. and they're standing me still with the belief that they don't want me to see images (because likely as I use things at that detail level, it'll be more obvious to them what the bits are, so the operators can stay up to speed with it.) they may also have the belief that they don't want me to know about their operation in my head. but, like I've said numerous times. if I can have access to do what I want in my wake state with my brain, you can have my sleep state, and also watching how I interact with my own brain at those detail levels will probably be huge clues to how to stay up to speed with it.

(they tell the story about the ocean view and circumstantial evidence) -- the story that lead me to the understanding that the images of my future self in the pueblo were likely the reasons why they are limiting my visual capacity so much

it just occurred to me when they said, "going to jail" that they are potentially trying to hide some damage that they did inside of my brain (probably with the vallecas incident) and they're trying to cover it up, because it was something harmful(?). that could explain the constant effort to try to affect a healing. perhaps the whole working against yourself bit is about the one group trying to get me into alignment with a healing, and the other group working to prevent me from seeing images.. so, the first group gets me feeling better, then the second group undoes any progress that was made... lol

it could be that they think caused some sort of damage or harm, when really all that happened is they became aware of damage that had already been done?

#### 18. old beliefs that don't serve

"instead of trying to talk yourself out of something, you're trying to talk yourself into something"

#### 20. decline as a false premise

"closing the gap is good, but a gap that isn't widening is good too"
"so, getting up to speed and kind of moving in the direction, that's not a bad way to live."
"moving in opposition: not so good. standing still while life causes your inner resources to move on, not so good"

so, instead of standing still, while your inner resources move on is a reference to the gap between where I am and my improved visual capacity -- so, are they suggesting then that instead of trying to close that gap, just don't don't let it get wider? getting up to speed and then moving in that direction (even if it never fully closes) isn't such a bad way to live.

I have toyed around with this idea since I heard him say, "you ain't gonna change me carlene" -- because I will be the one that changes, not you. in fact, if they would just stop changing (inventing new ways to keep me standing still), I would go back to feeling satisfaction again because I would begin feeling that gap close again, instead of it constantly widening because I'm standing still.

a while back, I sent an email to lyia saying that I didn't want them to fix my visual capacity or my motor capacity. I'm noticing improvements already as it is, so all they need to do for me to feel satisfaction would be to stop working so hard against me. I figure I can eventually close that gap. it may not be at first, but I certainly can close that gap.

however, since I'm in the whole paying a price and hardship (religious) way of thinking, I decided I liked the difficulty level increase, because I wanted to find a way of overcoming the opposition all by myself.

---

"it's not necessary to decline as you move though time; that's a byproduct of resistance"
"be willing to accept that decline as a false premise"

I have always said this, and it's nice that it comes right after the closing the gap conversation because my belief that things are always getting better will allow me to accelerate a bit, and hopefully one day I can close that gap

"satisfaction is a state of mind, not a state of condition"
