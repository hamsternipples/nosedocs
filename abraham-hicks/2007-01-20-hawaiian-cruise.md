what thoughts am I thinking about you, that have me pointed upstream?
what am I thinking about you, right now, which has me pointed upstream?

in the segment about relationships, the premise was that one should never use someone else's behaviour as the reason why I feel bad. I suppose in the past I learned with raquel that I could not (and neither wanted to) try and control her behaviour. therefore, I came to the conclusion that I would prefer in most circumstances to be alone. I do not really attempt to try and control any else's behaviour, so I suppose the reason why I even began with the premise that I had some control over her behaviour, came from a feeling of possession.

I do not really feel possession in a strong way any more, and I suppose it came from an idea that if I were going to invest a lot of time and energy into something, I would like to be responsible for it, as if I had a sense of ownership. I think this was a reaction to my involvement in tuenti where I invested a lot of time and energy into something that was not "mine". since then, I have been pretty disillusioned with the idea of possessions, and do not find to be all that permanent anyway.

I suppose there is value in diversity, and should I embrace that, I can find through a multitude of different perspectives, form a more complete picture (an even greater understanding) of how things fit together.

#### 12-05 depriving a child of fun in effort to protect her from a little contrast

about the guarded guardian: in the spirit of protection, you will try to become the guidance for the child. instead encourage their development of their sensitivity to their own guidance. see their value and trust in their ability to follow their own guidance.

actually, as I was thinking about it, this is kind of an "old" response. abraham is speaking to an adult which is not as sensitive to her guidance as I am. in the case of me interacting with kids, I think it will be really very easy for me to trust in their own guidance, because if, for example, a kid wants to do something that would seem to be "bad", yet I see it as ok -- if my own guidance is not giving me a negative reading, that means that my perception that it is ok, is the same one as my inner being has, and therefore it's all fine. I'll be able to easily navigate and create an environment which has very few rules, and an emphasis on everyone finding their own way. I think in that kind of environment, the contrast between each own of our different ways of perceiving things, will greatly enrich the experience, and we'll gain an appreciation for each of our differences in perception. (eg. no one way to perceive something, is necessarily the right way - but more like the starting point of perception)

#### 12-07 layers of perception, permanence and "reality"

"that's why when those like you begin to explore your deliberate connection with who you are, and you begin to view life through the lens of that broader perspective, you begin to see everything differently; and when enough of you do it, you have a paradigm shift that is visible to those around you as well"

it does seem like sometimes others around me are able to see better. so perhaps when more of us are seeing things in 3d, the entire planet will make a paradigm shift, so we all begin seeing like that.

#### 12-09 focus on the dream

"governments look long range at things"

"[a group of you] could focus on the dream that you have dreamed, and you could sit for an hour each day and talk only about the way that you would like life to be"

"when you start taking a more global view, you come into alignment with the source within you. because the source within you will not stand up against anyone - and when you use your enemy as your reason for what you want, but you are focused on your enemy, you do not come into alignment with your dream, and so it cannot be"

#### 12-11 timing about finding a relationship

"just because you've thought a thought, doesn't mean it's part of your point of attraction. but, when you focus on it and activate it, then it is"

I like this concept because I think a lot of things (even quite a few not so good things), yet somehow they are not a big player in my POA. it's the focus that matters.

"if you come together while you're still vibrationally mismatched, you won't stay together anyway."

"if you force the timing issue, through your determination and through your action -- and you come together physically before you've come into alignment with you, it won't be a good experience."

although it seems that there has been some form of thought around the idea that I would find a way of coming into alignment with me *after* the relationship has started, I believe it prudent to follow my initial instinct and wait for me figuring out how to be a vibrational match to my inner being. I tend to think of this as a consistency in the way I feel (feeling good no matter to circumstances) and will be evidenced by certain things such as no longer believing that nosebook has power over my experience. I feel I should also be capable of tuning into my inner being both visually and audibly, as it's my desire to have that kind of connection as the basis, because I think any other way would simply be too chaotic.

#### 12-12 - 12-14 koalas and taking action on a big dream without flowing the energy

"what is the experience of this physical manifestation"

"if you have a physical condition, and you can simply acknowledge how that physical condition if affecting your experience. the first things that occur to you, help you to identify it"
