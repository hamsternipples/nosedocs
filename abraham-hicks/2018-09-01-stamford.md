I was pretty conflictive leading up to this. I think I let out the air in the tires of mom and greg's car on wednesday or something like that. mom confronted me about it and I threatened to find a way of putting myself in the mental institution. I think to sum it all up, I don't really want anything to do with these guys. I didn't want to continue this constant dissatisfaction for the rest of my life.

as a result, it seems that they have been looking for any possible way of absolving themselves from being the reason for my limitations. it has appeared that they are trying to find any sort of phoney excuse to be the reason for my sudden change. looks like they don't want to give me the credit for figuring it out, and they don't want source getting the credit for it either. all options feel like loss of control for them and they don't want that

sometime after this session, I wrote about moses, elijah and a potential future (but I forgot to record the date, apparently... lame).
