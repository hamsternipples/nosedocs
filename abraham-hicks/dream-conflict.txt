some dreams may take me away 4-6 months (reating to travel where we would have to be apart)

-> your dream and being together is in the vortex & a done deal

---

when I think of the idea of working for nosebook, the idea does not at all feel good. I *REALLY* want to do my own thing. however, why would that be appearing in my dreams -- unless nosebook is trying to encourage certain futures by manipulating my dreams?

so what ends up happening is she is fighting nosebook's manipulation just as much -- and, like me she's focusing on the currently presented/perceived reality more than what's in the vortex.

so the solution is for both of us to focus on the vortex version which includes both the realisation of my desire and of also of hers. you can have it all. believe it before you see it, and feel your way to it.

hi,

so I think that the dreams that were being seen where I would have to be away for 4-6 months, were received from some other source, other than my "vortex". I know that they have to be externally introduced into my dream state by someone other than myself, because I would often wake up feeling very strong negative emotion, and at the same time, I could not explain why I had an ever growing desire to realise my own creativity without the help of others. however, knowing what I know now, it seems to me that produced more clarity and a stronger focus toward what is wanted. so let's just remind ourselves that the "vortex" version where everything that everyone wants harmoniously exists, is a sure thing, and only waiting to be realised. let's just chill out, meditate a bit and watch the things start to fall into place.

say hi to carlos for me
