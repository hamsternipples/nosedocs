part 3:
47:47 - talking about past lives, but the discussion continues to give a perspective that from our non-physical vantage point, past lives are like going to the movies: eg. no one expects one single movie to contain every element you'd want to ever see in a movie. I liked that example a lot because it answered a question I had about consistency of consciousness, and you wouldn't want to start your movie already having a general sense of everything that will happen (my non-physical vantage point)

vibration of cop == vibration of perpetrator

allowing well-being == resisting illness
there is no source of illness -- just resistance to well-being
