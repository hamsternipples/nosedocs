#### context

right around the time I stopped sleeping with headphones. I had made an effort to try and let there be an understanding that I could enjoy living an unresisted lifestyle during the day, and they could have my dream state. then, on the 7th I got my hand device removed and felt considerably better for a day and began to have more visual things in my eyes. the mood was probably pretty good. it was also associated with another one of those big changes. I gave up on the idea of constantly calling the guys trying to direct my life different names and settled on "well meaning hardasses". that began a series of aquisitions of more girls that would be apart of my planned later experience.

it got so out of hand, I sorta didn't really know what to do. I went out to watch stars and began to come to a series of realisations that after all, the fact that there would be so many of them would mean that they would all be much more independent and I perceived that they would become strong women.

this perception began to take more and more form in my mind as I began seeing an opportunity for something really cool (which I had never thought about before). it would be something like all of the girls would have the same visual capacity as I do where I can summon the thing in 3d space. in tesla's autobiography he makes special mention to note that when he was visualising the motor in 3d space, the guy with him could not see what he was seeing. in other places too, it seems that there is evidence that if we're all on the same wavelength, we could all see the same 3d object as if it were really there.

that idea really interested me ... I began thinking about maybe some sort of thing where I provide the desire and then these girls could awaken their capacity to physically manifest the things we visualise and create. sorta like some super team or something.

##### sidebar about 3d creativity

my experience has lead me to believe, that girls tend to perceive themselves not to be as mechanically oriented or builders/constructors, so there is some sort of invisible barrier to entry to invention. so, if they had the opportunity to create things at the speed of thought, it could really be incredible. I personally, am very curious to see what kinds of mental experiments or ideas they would toy around with in their mind as some sort of an afterthought. for me, those quiet inspirations can turn out to be the beginning of a road which leads to a major discovery or breakthrough. so, imagine if all they needed to do was to think it and the thing they were imagining could begin to exist in a visual format where others could see it and interact with it. I believe, amazing things would begin to occur because mechanical and physical creativity would no longer have such an intellectual barrier to entry. for example, it could be interesting to try reimagining many ordinary things from a fun or nurturing perspective. (something previously impossible because an entire team of people would have to give a "dumb idea" some thought)

additionally, I believe they are in for quite a surprise because when the thing they are "imagining" has to fit into 3d space and be believable, it introduces quite a few physical constraints on the form that the imagination does not have. it seems to me, that the realisation of this kind of visual capacity comes more from a "knowing". or, in discovery mode, it would comes more from a sense of how it should feel. therefore, it will be of utmost importance for their "feelings" and "knowings" to be tempered enough to produce the desired form.

when I was younger, I had this problem where I would physically see in 3d space things that would scare me. that's why I didn't watch scary movies. essentially, I had to shut down that capacity waiting for better emotional control. so, that means that in my vision of these girls with mastery over this, meant that I was also seeing them dominance over their emotions as well. very strong and self-empowered women and that's very very attractive to me.
