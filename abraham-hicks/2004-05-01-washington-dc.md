### 1. a hole in my bucket of well-being

«the worse you feel, you have achieved somehow legitimately, we agree you are always justified in every moment you pinch off your source. inotherwords, we never see you do it without reason. you always have very good reasons to cut yourself off from life-force. from our perspective never very good reasons; from your perspective: valid reasons»

I know it seems obvious, but to me I really like this because I've got a lot of really "valid reasons" that I have used as my excuse to cut myself off from life-force. I have been moving away from it as much as possible, mostly because my valid reasons just aren't getting me anywhere. it doesn't matter how valid they might be, I still have to find a way of feeling differently about the circumstances than I have been trained to feel about them. it doesn't matter who or how I got trained to respond to those valid reasons, this quote really helps to illustrate for me that I should really be wanting more the life-force than to validate or emphasise my reasons.

«so if you find yourself angry, feeling hateful, seeking revenge. if you find yourself in that strong negative emotion, what that always means, is that you have found something that you are pondering which is so vibrationally different from who you really are»

guilty :) lol

«that's why it's fun for us... we like to sort of shake things up a bit by talking to you about how much you love you.. because usually, you loving you is the last things that you try to do on purpose. it's the first thing you do naturally, but it's one of the last things you try to do on purpose because almost everybody around you is naturally loving themselves so much more, they find it odd when you love you. they would rather you love them»

I'm really getting good at this. even though I have been guilty in the past of finding myself in that strong negative emotion, I think me loving me is really what got me out of it. no matter how valid my reasons were, the negative emotion it was causing me was really beginning to slow everything way way down. I like to go fast, and I really like me, so I was a bit forced to find a way to feel good instead of validating my negative emotion. I know, I sacrificed so much to feel good like that.

«when you do align with the source energy that flows to you naturally, you feel valued. you feel valuable. you feel worthy. you feel light. you feel free. you feel sure-footed. you feel clear-minded. you feel such reserve of well-being that you can pour out your attention and your affection endlessly, and you never run out»

I really like that feeling light and free bit. that's what I feel like in my dream state before I begin to fly. it's such a good feeling. I also really like the clear-minded stuff too. I feel pretty naturally clear-minded and sure-footed now (in contrast to previously I didn't). I've never questioned my feeling of being valued, valuable, or worthy. those are obvious to me, so now I'm looking forward to the light and free feelings.

«you picture a bucket with well-being flowing in at the top and well-being running out the bottom. if it's runs out the bottom faster than it's flowing in at the top, you don't feel so good»

just the other day in my @[entry](2018-09-13 14:36) entry, I made the metaphor that my head was like a bathtub and dmt (well-being) was being created and flowing into the bathtub. when I watch stars, it makes a big hose filling the bathtub. when they run their machine, it's like a big drain. the reason why I don't feel so good is because I'm almost always running on empty. I have to find ways of lowering resistance so my brain produces more. I tried to explain this last night with the coke example in the @[entry](2018-09-16 06:51) entry, but a bathtub is much easier to understand.

most people have a bathtub that's filled by a small water spout. it fills up the tub at a rate of 1 gallon an hour. in order to produce images in your eyes, let's say you need 20 gallons per hour. if the standard bathtub is 100 gallons, so you've got 5 hours of reserve in there. you also use this reserve for other things like mental clarity, inspired interaction with others and other good feeling things. for me, this well-being is the chemical my brain produces which allows me to express love and improves my perception of everyone / everything around me.

let's say they need to keep my reserves at less than 10 so I don't see images. what I have to do is to up production then. they have to drain my bathtub at a faster rate than I can fill it. normally I cannot do this, so I watch stars (or do drugs). this is similar to getting a big hose to fill the bathtub. for some time I can fill the bathtub quicker than they can empty it, so I can sometimes see images in my eyes after watching stars.

if I want to see images, I have to find a way of increasing my own production to be more than they can drain. every time that I release resistance, I am able to increase my production capacity. this is what I'm doing while watching stars...

«but when you open your valve and you realise that it flows endlessly, and that you always have a huge reserve because you are tapped into the source of that which is the reserve of well-being»

so that's what I'm learning now is how to hook up to the source of that which is the reserve of well-being. I may have the ability to produce 10g/hr, and the stars may be able to produce 60g/hr. I have a net gain of only 10g/hr if they're able to take up to 50g/hr from me. increasing my production is a bit of going about it the hard way, so I'm learning that even if they could figure out how to take 500g/hr, and it makes no difference if I can learn to hook into a 1000g/hr hose.

having that kind of well-being (dmt) deficit requires me to figure out how to hook into that source hose instead, giving me a new unlimited source of well-being which I can now flow toward and love others with.

«then you don't worry about attention that you're giving to others or love that you're giving to others -- or anything that you're giving to others»

coming soon, I will be looking for ways to retrofit my bathtub into a more efficient conduit cause it'll only be flow since my reserve comes directly from the source. the limiting factor will no longer be the size of the reserve (capacity), but the volume (amps) that can flow through in a unit time.

«..because it is always replenished proportionate to what you are flowing. in fact, that's how it get's into your bucket to begin with. you flow it through your perspective»

it's funny to me how all of this is coming together. as you realise that when I speak of how your emotion is encoded into what you see (and feel), the high frequency portion of the physical experience, the more you flow well-being, the more and better you see everything, the more and better you see everything, the more well-being you summon (produce), and the cycle is endless and infinite to how detailed and rich the experience can get. you flow it through your perspective, and you summon as much as you are flowing (through your perspective).

«you say, "I am not comfortable thinking of myself as a vibrational being" -- so we say, "think of yourself as an emotional being, because it is one and the same thing". an emotional being is aware of emotions ... when you are aware of emotions, you are aware of vibrational variance»

yay me :)

«you understand radio frequencies enough to know that that they've got to match up, so we want you to say, "when I have been focusing on things that make me feel this ornery or make me feel this vulnerable or make me feel this angry, or make me feel this bound or not-free -- I cannot be, at the same time a vibrational match to the well-being I've been telling the universe I want"»

I really like this because I've been wanting a lot more well-being in my life, but clearly I'm not a vibrational match to it yet. I have been focusing on things that make me feel bound or not-free.

### 2. my good stuff is being held in escrow

«there isn't anything that we could say to you other than you hold the key *now* to opening the vibrational vortex to allow the emotional journey that will make you feel better now»

«and when you feel better now, *consistently* -- doors open, circumstances change, the world caters to you in a way that few of you have realised yet -- and those who watch say, "who decided that you were the the blessed one. who anointed you king of the world. how is that you have to only softly give a thought of preference and next time you turn around, there is an avenue through which it can be fulfilled" -- and you say, "oh, haven't you heard, I am the blessed one? haven't you heard, I am the centre of the universe? haven't you heard, I only have to ask and then not get in my own way, and it happens to me every single time"»

sounds good, I guess. I don't think I want to (called) be king of the world though, but it is a bit like that already. I don't really mind about the other stuff, but I'm still a bit confounded about the part about not getting in my own way. I already get in my own way very little but it seems that I'm still not quite a vibrational match to it. it does seem like more and more, anything I want is becoming possible. there seems to be little physical evidence of it right now, but I suppose I do feel it coming. that's the weird bit -- because, later on, they talk about feeling better even when the circumstances don't change. that's kind of where I'm at now. I am getting so good at feeling better now, that I do feel like I'm gaining that kind of consistency.

I've always said that practicing the feeling place of something, because feeling comes immediately previous to physicality, that physicality has to conform to a strong feeling. I'm learning that this can also happen visually too. like, if I feel an object's presence really strongly, it takes visual form in 3d space too. so I mean, I guess we'll have to wait and see. I'm in no rush. I'm going to be getting consistent at feeling good no matter the circumstances, as I think this skill will also be important for me to hold the feeling of a visualised invention, idea, or explanation stable, even when others' perception of it previously would modify the feeling. I've proven to myself that I can maintain stability on the feeling when I was programming. so, I've gotten way better at maintaining the feeling even with others in the mix, I'm just learning to connect that feeling to reality (or 3d space) in my imagination.

we'll see soon enough. I guess all I have to "do", is to *feel better now, consistently*.

### 3. how soon can cats and humans reincarnate?

«it is possible for the energy or consciousness that is at the source of your father, or any of you, to be present in many physical beings all at the same time»

I really like this idea. I was first introduced to this idea when I was working for essembly and noah had made a few alternate accounts for himself, thinking that he would use them to poke a bit of fun at zaryn. I always thought this was quite an interesting idea. also, when I was younger, I made pen and paper superheroes, and my favourite was one that I made called multiplier man (or something equally poorly named). he was able to instantaneously make multiples of himself and direct them all from an over-arching non-physical consciousness.

the deficiency with multiplier man is that he was a duplicate of himself, but what noah taught me is that someone could, having multiple personalities, and having multiple different physical instantiations (accounts), one could actually affect change. he manipulated joe and zaryn endlessly with his alter-egos. also they were of different gender than he as well, so even having conversations with himself, he could make contrive something to his benefit. that *really* got me thinking.. :)

«when you talk about the second-coming of christ or you talk about the source energy, or the love of God, you have to understand that it is a stream that eternally flows»

«your father did not have to die for the inner being or the source energy of that is him to come fourth into yet another and yet another, and yet another physical being»

as I'm beginning to come to know myself less and less as this physical being (thanks to such a deemphasis on my physical experience by my nosebook friends), I am coming to know myself more and more as the over-arching non-physical stream of consciousness that resides in multiple bodies here on earth right now, and also in the past as well.

what if all of this is on purpose? what if the reason why the guys at the bso are so adamant that I have my physical experience reduced further and further, because that guy calling the shots in the bso is also an extension of the non-physical stream of consciousness that I am learning about -- who I *really* am (just pinched off). the irony would be quite a bit, but it sure would explain why my circumstances are pointing me in the direction of getting in tune with who I really am, the non-physical consciousness that is me, my inner being..

what if additionally, I am also some (or all) of the girls too, and I thought, from my non-physical perspective, that it would be just absolutely fantastic to make love to myself, too.

you know, the probability of something that crazy to be actually happening, is high enough, that it really wouldn't surprise me at all.. in fact, I think it's probably the most likely explanation.

«so, when you consider someone that you know and adore, and you say, "I'm hoping this person may come back", and we say, even if you do, you may not recognise them because the person that you knew as dad or you knew as whoever -- that person was a combination of allowing who they really were, and disallowing who they really were»

it doesn't surprise me, because no one making fake accounts is who they really are. they are an alternate personality of theirself for the contrived purpose of achieving some goal, or just to have fun. the part that strikes me as interesting is the part where you could easily recognise yourself if both of you are not pinched to who you really are. that's really cool. all I would want to do then, is to allow myself to learn, have fun, and expand along with them -- and how much fun it will be when we're all allowing that connection to that non-physical stream of energy all at the same time.

crazy cool.

«most of the human personality that you come to know as the person next door, is not a perfect reflection of who they really are. it's a muted, distorted, pinched-off version of who they really are»

«and, we say this to you lovingly, but you are pinched off versions of who you really are. any time you've been *ornery*; any time you've been *angry*; any time you've been *fearful*; any time you've been *lonely*; any time you've been *disrespectful*; any time you've *felt disrespected* -- you are a pinched off version of who you really are»

yeah, lol, ok :)

«the way it is, is as varied as the individual mind who focuses the energy and creates the realism around them»

man, a broader, more diverse perspective really can create so much more fun. I can see now, that you really don't want everything to go just perfect. if you can see yourself as a multiple person consciousness living many lifetimes, you definitely want difficulty so as to build up to quite a crescendo. nice :D

sidenote: the idea of multiple instantiations of the same consciousnesses is a strong theme in my life, actually. while writing, I was reminded of the long discussions I had with marcos about the way I programmed the "user" system for affinaty. you had an "identity" and each identity could have multiple "muns" .. I frequently had serious multiple personality disorder, and I wanted to streamline the ability to switch back and fourth between them, especially on a website where you relate and communicate with others based on your ideologies. as I think about it more, man is this theme strong in my life... bipolar, nope, try tripolar and soon to be quadrapolar :D

### 5. who was hearing while refusing to hear?

in this segment, the woman talks about hearing voices in her head. now, I hear voices in my head all of the time, but they hardly ever make any sense at all. abraham then went on to say that esther is receiving blocks of thought from her broader non-physical perspective and then translating them.

so, since these voices don't make a whole lot of sense, is what is happening is they are sending thoughts into my head and then I'm translating these thoughts. however, only sometimes I can actually hear the translation in my head. as soon as I become aware of the voices, all of a sudden a loud whirring begins, much like the one that happens when I see images, and now I don't hear the voices again.

it must mean that my bucket of well-being (dmt) filled to enough capacity to amplify the signal enough to be able to hear sound and see images. the whirring sound must be them emptying the reserve again so that the image and sound are no longer big enough for me to hear or see (though their machine can still read the un-illuminated or un-amplified signal -- so then, on their end, they can amplify the signal so that they can see it or hear it). frustrating. I want so badly to be able to use that capacity to tap into non-physical consciousness, and they want to hold me from that just so they can translate my thoughts into words they can send to others :(

really, if we worked on the nexus idea, then I could have once again control over my translation capacity and enjoy translating these blocks of thought into things meaningful to me. the nexus would provide a means to retransmit out thoughts, not dependant on language, to others in a way which the same thought would be translated by them in a way meaningful to listener. here isn't the place for this, but it's something that needs to be done.

### 6. can the holy-spirit co-create their business?

«freedom is an emotional journey»

«I am wanting to connect with the holy spirit, so that the holy spirit can show me the way to get me to the financial freedom that I want»

rewritten in my case, this becomes: I am wanting to connect with my source so that my source can show me the way to get me to the freedom I want.

it's not exactly like that, but let's go with it for now.. abraham responds, to their words by saying «oh, the detours involved in that sort of journey»

so, I can say that I do have the expectation that finding my alignment to my source will help me to find that freedom. I see the detour involved... they suggest instead, «help me to *feel* what I expect to feel once I've achieved that --financial-- freedom. it's the feeling I'm going for. and when you go for the feeling, rather than the process which takes you to the action, which takes you to the manifestation, now it's something that you can do fast.. and then, the circumstances and events align to help you with the manifestation»

I know this sounds a bit ironic, considering just days ago I was encouraging the girls to find the feeling place of what they're desiring, and I get it. I can (and do) utilise my feeling to point me in the direction of what I want and achieve it, but those specific words helped. I don't really understand why. anyway..

«it's a big difference from allowing the universe to yield to you, and demanding of yourself that you jump through the right hoops in order to earn...»

«earning doesn't feel very good, does it. earning sounds like somebody else holds the strings. somebody else gets to decide whether I have jumped through the hoops in the right way»

«earning and allowing are not the same thing, are they. earning is about action, and allowing is about the emotional journey»

«you show yourself when you are ready to allow good stuff to flow to you when you stop worrying about every little thing. when you are really at ease, no matter what, you've really made it»

«as long as you're worrying about what you're doing, or worrying about if it's the right thing, or worrying about what somebody else thinks about it, you're not in that vibrational place of allowing»

«as long as some sort of action ... when, you believe, that you need to do something differently than you are doing, then you're not feeling worthy»

no action!! I love it. I'm so sick of feeling like I have to *do* something. there's nothing to be done for me to be worthy enough to receive the good stuff. awesome :)

«when you are ready to say, "here I be. give me the good stuff"»

«and you've erased all those records playing like, "nothing ever comes easy" or, "you have to be in the right place at the right time" or, "you have to have done the things that make the holy spirit love you"»

often times I feel like I have to live up to some unknown meta that the people pulling the strings are doing. they seem to be like the "holy spirit" in their example of how some people think. expecting me do the right things so that I can be worthy enough to earn their love.

«you can't have broken those rules. you can't even *think* about breaking those rules, let alone break those rules. there are lists that have been offered to our dear human friends by other dear human friends, in an effort to help you *earn* the well-being that is your birthright»

I often times wish there were a list, cause then I could find my way a whole lot easier, but there is no list. the "rules" are constantly changing, and they often times change depending on what I think. they're constantly evolving the rules to ensure I am held away from my well-being (dmt) which my own body produces.

«and we would like so much to help you to get back to that place where you just say, "here I be. let it flow"»

I'm getting there, little by little. the continual improvement that I experience tells me that while others may have the privilege of letting their machines flow a lot of well-being to them, I still have an above average experience. it shouldn't be long before I'm hooked into that which is the reserve of well-being. I feel like it's a step-by-step process, where the main limiting factor is my capacity to flow such a quantity of energy, which is expanding every day now...

«and when someone says to you, "what are you doing to deserve it?". you say, "absolutely nothing. it's just the way it's supposed to be. it's supposed to be this way"»

that is precisely the reason why I'm so hard on this issue. it is the way it's supposed to be. so, as far as I can tell, there is no reason for which I would be undeserving of it, unless as postulated in the reincarnation bit, perhaps I'm playing both sides of the field, and the objective is actually to heighten my sensitivity to only high-frequency vibrations by having a reduced physical experience. who knows. since it's my birthright, and I'm hard-headed enough, this really is a non-negotiable thing for me. you will not be able to talk me out of (like so many others have done to forfeit theirs) my own connection to my own full experience.

«now, you can't be there if you're *demanding it*, or if you are feeling guilty about it coming»

I have begun to step back from demanding it, even though I do feel quite justified in my having it (considering I was the one who discovered it), I am realising that feeling of injustice or whatever feeling it is that produces the need for me to want to demand it, is holding me in a state of disallowing. like they said in the opening segment, I may have some very valid reasons for not letting that energy flow, I'm still disallowing the energy stream.

I think the feeling guilty about it coming bit was put there as a potentiality in case they were able to make me feel bad by convincing me that getting my capacities will deprive so many other people of some part of the experience (maybe a visual or audio translation experience, who knows what), so then that I should feel guilty not sacrificing for the "greater good". lol

I do not feel I need to demand it either, as I'm realising, especially with the reincarnation realisation that all of this is probably part of a bigger process to realise a newer even greater capacity which is only achieved once I come to the realisation of who I really am (fwh told me to ponder the words "I AM"), and I hook into that energy stream. so, no biggie. I can tell, as I get a bigger and bigger picture, that it's all going to work out just perfectly.

---

«when you feel like somebody else needs to do something in order to change the way you are, so that you can feel differently, there's no freedom in that. you've got to show yourself that you can feel differently, even if not one other being anywhere does anything differently»

«true freedom comes in understanding that you can adjust the way you feel without any circumstances changing»

I believe this is right where I'm at right now. I will write this in my wall to remind me, because I remember listening to the recording from the workshop @[abe](2017-04-08) which I listened to right before my 34th birthday which there was something about freedom which resonated really strongly with me back then which solidified my pretty much already made up decision to skip the carlota event. I wanted very much to feel my freedom, and at that time I can't remember what exactly that meant to me, but I would often say something like, "true freedom is only realised when you can feel however you want, whenever you want" (an idea I obviously borrowed from abraham).

I guess what impacts me in this quote is the "without the circumstances changing" bit. I sort have always just expected my change in feeling to create different circumstances. lately though, I have had to realise that I can change how I feel and I do it, not to affect the circumstances, but for no other reason than to just feel better. it's weird how little circumstances have to do with true freedom. throw all common-sense logic out the window there and replace it with an unwillingness to deviate from universal principals. I'm getting there :)

---

«when you say, "freedom is over there, and I'm over here, and I've got to get over there before I will get free" -- *you're stuck where you are*. you've got to stop saying there is no freedom here or you can't get over there where there's more freedom»

«what's happening is you're wanting so hard to sell what's over there, that you're shooting yourself in the foot talking about how bad what's over here is»

I don't really know if I do this. something strikes me about it though. I don't believe I try very much at all to sell where I'm going. I mostly am interested in finding out what my visual capacity is all about. I already know there will be so many things yet to be discovered, and I can also feel the bigness of it, just by feeling others' reactions to it. I guess it's pretty amazing. I don't really believe that I justify it's amazingness by comparing it to the horribleness of my everyday experience. maybe I do that a bit with my vision or with the shocks, but I don't really see much correlation right now. I'm going to think about that a little more I suppose.

maybe I do. maybe I justify its amazingness by their shocking me and working so hard to prevent me from having it. if they're willing to work *that* hard to try and prevent me from having it, it must be really really really awesome. I do know that they produce insane amounts of desire in me to have it because of that, and I suppose it maybe figuring out how to overcome their opposition to me having it, is becoming a bit of a thing like "earning it". hmm, I guess we've come full-circle.

«what you have to start doing is to look for positive aspects of where you are -- and as you find one little glimmer of something that makes you feel better where you are, your vibration will shift and then you can move just a little bit»

positive aspects of where I am. hmmm. that's a good one. I don't know that I can find that many right now. I'm not trying to change my situation though. I kinda like it because it's a relatively comfortable little place for me to have a place to live, food, etc. and I essentially get to watch stars all I want. any other place, and I would probably have much less stars or less ease in regard to the daily things like food, laundry, etc.

### 7. he's feeling pressured to manifest his dreams

«we think that the reason they're tapping into your dream, is because they can believe in the manifestation of your dream, even more than they can believe in the manifestation of their own»

«we think what's bothering you, is not that they're pressuring you, because we can feel that you would like to fulfil your dream too. we think that what is happening is, it is amplifying your awareness that things aren't quite lined up -- and it's easier for you, when things aren't lined up, to just take a deep breath and say, "well, I'm pushing it too fast" -- but it's harder if have other people around you to get them to understand that»

«but this is a wonderful opportunity for you to show them what you do when you can feel that you are out of alignment»

«we watch many of you who are coming more into your conscious awareness of your own vibrational alignment, and there is almost a feeling of resentment when you find other people around you that are making sort of shockwaves in your vibration. it's sort of like what you're wanting to say to them is, "either go away and be a non-vibrating issue in my energy field, or get it right"»

my initial reaction to this piece was that I don't really care so much that people are excited about my dreams. it doesn't really bother me much at all. however, the specific words, "non-vibrating issue in my energy field" made me think more of the energy field of my body, not the energy field of the conversation. so many people want so many things, and what other people want really doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me. it kind of reminds me of an episode where a woman was concerned about her son's wedding. she wanted to make him a big wedding, but didn't have the money to do so, and they just wanted to get married on a beach. by nature, I would also reject the whole celebration thing, too. I get that. especially in spain I could feel it, but people needed a celebration to have an excuse to feel good, and that bothered me a lot. I just simply refused to participate.

this section also brings that whole problem to the surface. I have made mention many times that I would prefer a trial period of some time before any deals or celebrations are made. the reason for this is my experience that celebrating when no energy is in motion is the most sure-fire way to kill something. often times the celebration gives a sense of an arrival to a destination, or some sort of accomplishment, when really nothing has been achieved. it's sorta like celebrating that you arrived to work (probably much later than expected, too). or, maybe celebrating that you just had a good idea.

so yeah, I guess I do feel this a whole lot more than I originally realised (but felt I needed to write it down anyway). furthermore, the whole energy field in the body is a whole nother issue which is a complete deal-breaker for me. you cannot expect me to perform well without energy movement, and I refuse to do so until I am comfortable enough with the energy that I have and am satisfied with my capability in it. I understand that they believe that they must drain my battery as much as I charge it. that's fine with me, when my charge pressure and current are enough for me to feel capable enough to transmit the energy, then I'm ready.

they will not likely ever become a non-vibrating issue in my energy field though, which is fine too, because instead of getting mad at them and demanding they get it right, I will be the one to get it right. the physical energy field is just a matter of time and practice that I'll get right before moving forward. the celebration aspect I won't be participating in (because when they're celebrating, I'm beginning the most difficult part of my life yet: all the problems now has to offer, combined with many more desires and wants). the out of alignment with myself aspect is a non-issue, because I won't be out of alignment with myself when the manifestation occurs -- cause it won't manifest until then. the details not quite feeling right, is also a not an issue either, because I don't worry about them. LOA takes care of all of that for me. my only work is feeling good no matter the circumstances.

«... neither of them [that they'll go away or get it right] can happen, while you've got your eye on them -- and so you kind of hold to you the very thing that you are not wanting»

I purposefully kept this separate from the above. they're saying that neither will these people making shockwaves in my energy field go away or be able to get it right, while I continue to notice that they're making those shockwaves in my energy field. I know this, very very well. I've tried to minimise (especially recently) my conversation on the subject, not even bringing it up at all, but I am sure that the people monitoring my thoughts will know that, even though I'm not talking about it, it's quite present in my thoughts. I may be making headway though, because I am actually beginning to not think about it as much, and just feel it. my thoughts are quite burdensome as they seem to be perpetuated by their machines that are trying to "guide" my thoughts or something, or maybe they're constantly poking at my mind trying to get my opinion on what I think about something or -- maybe law of attraction, I dunno. the point is, I don't really like thinking so much any more. I'm beginning to convert to a more feeling based approach, as it feels like I have considerably more freedom in the way I feel, and best of all, I don't need to translate those feelings, as they're a bit off of their radar (for now. I'm sure they'll upgrade their technology soon and hose my safe-zone yet again)

«they, and what they think, have to become a real non-issue to you»

the other reason why I wanted this to be a separate point is because I don't know if either of those happening is a huge desire of mine, either. it did kind of bother me, but that was back when I needed conditions to be good to feel good. however now I don't really mind that they're making shockwaves in my vibration, as I seem to be still able to navigate, regardless. most importantly, I don't believe that they have any desire to leave me alone or to get it right, either. they seem pretty insistent on doing things their way (which I may consider the "wrong way", perhaps). so since their desire is for neither of those, and my desire is to learn how to navigate with shockwaves, it's unlikely that'll be changing any time soon.

so, since the desire seems pretty much mutual, the shockwaves will continue to increase in size as they learn, I figure I might as well give it extra attention perhaps. at the very minimum, I need to just accept it as normal, cause it isn't going to be changing. this obviously implies that there will be a growing difference of opinion between us, naturally, but I am learning how to navigate in the freedom of my feelings instead of trying to navigate with words or action to make the feeling. it's really becoming a non-issue for me :)

«have you ever been around someone, who -- maybe it was a child who was making up a complete fantasy -- an absolute fabrication about something, and you didn't really think that they were going to get a unicorn and jump over the moon on it, but they're talking to you about it -- and so you just smile and say, "that's nice", and you don't try to dash their dreams; you don't try to set them straight. you just, you're willing to let them have their fantasy while you go about whatever you're doing»

I did, I finally got here. they can make up complete fabrications about me and send them off to millions of people, and they can make me say or do things in my dream-state that let other people have their fantasy, and then I just wake up and I say, "that's nice". enjoy living out your own fantasies in my dream, but I'm still in the phase of figuring out how to align with it, instead of trying to make it happen.

«well, what you're going to want to do with these people that are trying to hook into your fantasies or your dreams, is sort of think about them like you would that child: just say, "that's nice" -- don't let what they think be so important to you»

yeah, it used to bother me a lot, like they were using my dream as a method of taking advantage of a whole lot of other people. I don't mind any more... I didn't realise how much I've already getting this naturally, this workshop is only helping me to confirm and reinforce my resolution.

«how do you go about that? you go about that by letting what you think be the thing that is most important to you»

nailed it.

«so you say, "well that's sort of how I got here. I want to feel good. they're sort of in there, not making me feel so good. why don't they just mind their own business and dream their own dream, and leave me in a place where things can sort of level out"»

before I even began listening to this workshop, that is mostly how I felt. just leave me alone I would often say, knowing that if they would just stop trying to help me so much, it would all work out. I have since learned though that the extra friction they provide actually adds more energy to the dream.

«we want to say to you, powerful creators like yourself will always have others who are sort of following the jet-stream; it's just the way that it always is, and it's time for you, sooner than later to become comfortable with whatever they do in relationship to you»

yeah, I definitely have noticed this in my life. it doesn't bother me so much. I've only been pretty miffed because they are actively trying to hijack my dream from me, attempting to prevent certain parts of it from happening. the idea of the jet-stream implies that they have a less resistant ride flying behind me. that I don't mind, and they definitely are already. you see this with my visual capacity. they certainly have a much much easier time understanding how the visual capacity works because I'm lowering my resistance to get the continual upgrades, and they're just enjoying that benefit without needing to lower their own resistance. if they were just flying in my jet-stream, and not actively trying to steal my dream away from me as their own and hold me from it, then I wouldn't mind.

«and that is something you very much want to teach and you very much want to understand: is how can I maintain my own vibrational frequency regardless of anything anybody is doing around it»

well, that is indeed precisely where I am at. I am learning how maintain my vibrational frequency no matter the circumstances. I really am getting pretty good at it now, too.

«because, the thing that you're wanting to teach.. the thing that really needs to be taught (it would benefit anyone who learned it), is don't ask circumstances to change in order for you to feel good»

that's kind of where I'm at now. we've got to give up on the idea of trying to change the bso or trying to attempt to regulate them or whatever. we've got to figure out how to feel good even when the circumstances don't change.

«you're wanting to not need them to be different in order for you to feel good»

ditto.

«we know, sometimes very well-meaning people can just make you nuts -- and, there is this desire to please them that is at the root of you letting that happen. when you release your desire to please them... so, how can you let go of that desire to please them? well, it feels good to please them, and it doesn't feel good to not please them. but, what's at the root of needing to please someone else is you tried (not just you; almost everyone) you tried to fill the void of your not connection to your inner being by pleasing someone else who could shine a little approval or appreciation on you. inotherwords, it was sort of a flawed substitute for true connection -- and now it's sort of a vicious circle because you're in that habit of trying to please them because it has paid off some times in the past but in trying to please them, you are at the same time, sometimes not able to please yourself»

thankfully, I feel no desire to please anyone other than myself. actually, that's how I got into this whole mess to begin with. my desire to no longer try and please anyone or need them to do something for me to feel good, put me into a series of events whereby I proved to myself that I could feel good all by myself. I didn't need to (and definitely couldn't) please a woman enough for her to fill that void inside of me. when I abandoned that whole idea of looking for approval from someone else and made my priority and my dream, connection with my inner being, the dream is also the solution here.

the dream opened up all kinds of other things. it is true: seek ye first, the kingdom of heaven and *all things* will be added unto you. making that the top priority and the dream has given me a new concept that *all things* are possible, and that did not come from someone else's approval of me.

«how can I feel so good about myself that it's alright with me even if somebody is looking at me and they're not approving of who I am? that's ultimate worthiness, isn't it. I like me so much, it no longer matters to me what you feel about me. which means now I'm free from standing on my head to get your approval. but, the big payoff is, when you really feel that free and you really feel that worthy, you're delicious to be with and everybody who's with you benefits»

nailed it. I'm sure that I will be delicious to be around. that's why I'm unwavering on my resolution to make my connection to my inner being my first and only priority. soooo nailed it :)

«so then you say, it must not be about them; it must be about me. these emotions that I'm having, must be about how *I* feel about this. inotherwords, maybe they're just helping, through their attention, to shine a spotlight on my awareness that I'm not lined up with what I want ... they're just reminding me that I'm not doing what I'm saying I want to do. so then, I'm saying, "well, that's because I want the universe to give it to me" -- and we want to say to you, "if you were in alignment with your dream, the universe would be giving it to you right now" -- but, it's alright for your dream to be an expanding dream»

once again, that's why I'm unwavering on my resolution to make my connection to my inner being my first and only priority :D boom! HEADSHOT!

«that's the hard part about co-creating. whey you co-create with others sometimes -- every time you co-create with someone else, the things they want get vibrationally factored in»

I am aware now, more than ever about this. I seem to be making a lot of bso dreams a reality which harmonised with my own.

«it's very important, especially when co-creating, that you continually talk to yourself about what is important for you, so that what is important to you becomes the dominant vibration»

yes, I know. it seems that my dreams involving my visual capacity and understanding about how my brain works harmonised with a lot of bso dreams, which worked out for them quite well, but then their desire that I don't have a visual capacity and that I don't have access to, and understand how my brain works is in disharmony with my own dreams. watching my dream vanish enough times now, I have learned how to ensure it is the dominant vibration. it is very important you know what is important for you, to ensure that it remains the dominant vibration.
