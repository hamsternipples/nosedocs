«freedom is an emotional journey»

«I am wanting to connect with the holy spirit, so that the holy spirit can show me the way to get me to the financial freedom that I want»

rewritten in my case, this becomes: I am wanting to connect with my source so that my source can show me the way to get me to the freedom I want.

it's not exactly like that, but let's go with it for now.. abraham responds, to their words by saying «oh, the detours involved in that sort of journey»

so, I can say that I do have the expectation that finding my alignment to my source will help me to find that freedom. I see the detour involved... they suggest instead, «help me to *feel* what I expect to feel once I've achieved that --financial-- freedom. it's the feeling I'm going for. and when you go for the feeling, rather than the process which takes you to the action, which takes you to the manifestation, now it's something that you can do fast.. and then, the circumstances and events align to help you with the manifestation»

I know this sounds a bit ironic, considering just days ago I was encouraging the girls to find the feeling place of what they're desiring, and I get it. I can and do utilise feeling to point me in the direction of what I want and achieve it, but those specific words helped. I don't really understand why. anyway..

«it's a big difference from allowing the universe to yield to you, and demanding of yourself that you jump through the right hoops in order to earn...»

«earning doesn't feel very good. earning sounds like somebody else is holds the strings. somebody else gets to decide whether I have jumped through the hoops in the right way»

«earning and allowing are not the same thing, are they. earning is about action, and allowing is about the emotional journey»

«you show yourself when you are ready to allow good stuff to flow to you when you stop worrying about every little thing. when you are really at ease, no matter what, you've really made it»

«as long as you're worrying about what you're doing, or worrying about if it's the right thing, or worrying about what somebody else thinks about it, you're not in that vibrational place of allowing»

«as long as some sort of action... when, you believe, that you need to do something differently than you are doing, then you're not feeling worthy»

no action!! I love it. I'm so sick of feeling like I have to *do* something. there's nothing to be done for me to be worthy enough to receive the good stuff. awesome :)

«when you are ready to say, "here I be. give me the good stuff"»

«and you've erased all those records playing like, "nothing ever comes easy" or, "you have to be in the right place at the right time" or, "you have to have done the things that make the holy spirit love you"»

«you can't break those rules. you can't even *think* about breaking those rules. there are lists that have been offered to our dear human friends by other dear human friends, in an effort to help you *earn* the well-being that is your birthright»

«and we would like so much to help you to get back to that place where you just say, "here I be. let it flow"»

«and when someone says to you, "what are you doing to deserve it?". you say, "absolutely nothing. it's just the way it's supposed to be"»

«now you can't be there if you're *demanding it*, or if you are feeling guilty about it coming»

I have begun to step back from demanding it, even though I do feel quite justified in my having it (considering I was the one who discovered it), I am realising that feeling of injustice or whatever feeling it is that produces the need for me to want to demand it, is holding me in a state of disallowing. like they said in the opening segment, I may have some very valid reasons for not letting that energy flow, I'm still disallowing the energy stream.

«when you feel like somebody else needs to do something in order to change the way you are, so that you can feel differently, there's no freedom in that. you've got to show yourself that you can feel differently, even if not one other being anywhere does anything differently»

«true freedom comes in understanding that you can adjust the way you feel without any circumstances changing»

I believe this is right where I'm at right now. I will write this in my wall to remind me, because I remember listening to the recording from the workshop @[abe](2017-04-08) which I listened to right before my 34th birthday which there was something about freedom which resonated really strongly with me back then which solidified my pretty much already made up decision to skip the carlota event. I wanted very much to feel my freedom, and at that time I can't remember what exactly that meant to me, but I would often say something like, "true freedom is only realised when you can feel however you want, whenever you want" (an idea I obviously borrowed from abraham).

I guess what impacts me in this quote is the "without the circumstances changing" bit. I sort have always just expected my change in feeling to create different circumstances. lately though, I have had to realise that I can change how I feel and I do it, not to affect the circumstances, but for no other reason than to just feel better. it's weird how little circumstances have to do with true freedom. throw all common-sense logic out the window there and replace it with an unwillingness to deviate from universal principals. I'm getting there :)

«when you say, "freedom is over there, and I'm over here, and I've got to get over there before I will get free" -- *you're stuck where you are*. you've got to stop saying there is no freedom here or you can't get over there where there's more freedom»

«what's happening is you're wanting so hard to sell what's over there, that you're shooting yourself in the foot talking about how bad what's over here is»

I don't really know if I do this. something strikes me about it though. I don't believe I try very much at all to sell where I'm going. I mostly am interested in finding out what my visual capacity is all about. I already know there will be so many things yet to be discovered, and I can also feel the bigness of it, just by feeling others' reactions to it. I guess it's pretty amazing. I don't really believe that I justify it's amazingness by comparing it to the horribleness of my everyday experience. maybe I do that a bit with my vision or with the shocks, but I don't really see much correlation right now. I'm going to think about that a little more I suppose.

maybe I do. maybe I justify its amazingness by their shocking me and working so hard to prevent me from having it. if they're willing to work *that* hard to try and prevent me from having it, it must be really really really awesome. I do know that they produce insane amounts of desire in me to have it because of that, and I suppose it maybe figuring out how to overcome their opposition to me having it, is becoming a bit of a thing like "earning it". hmm, I guess we've come full-circle.

«what you have to start doing is to look for positive aspects of where you are -- and as you find one little glimmer of something that makes you feel better where you are, your vibration will shift and then you can move just a little bit»

positive aspects of where I am. hmmm. that's a good one. I don't know that I can find that many right now. I'm not trying to change my situation though. I kinda like it because it's a relatively comfortable little place for me to have a place to live, food, etc. and I essentially get to watch stars all I want. any other place, and I would probably have much less stars or less ease in regard to the daily things like food, laundry, etc.

### 7. he's feeling pressured to manifest his dreams

«how can I feel so good about myself that it's alright with me even if somebody is looking at me and they're not approving of who I am? that's ultimate worthiness, isn't it. I like me so much, it no longer matters to me what you feel about me. that means I'm free from standing on my head to get your approval. but, the big payoff is, when you really feel that free and you really feel that worthy, you're delicious to be with and everybody who's with you benefits»

«every time you co-create with someone else, the things they want get vibrationally factored in»

«it's very important, especially when co-creating, that you continually talk to yourself about what is important for you, so that what is important to you becomes the dominant vibration»
