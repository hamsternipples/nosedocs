#### context

last night was the solar eclipse seen on the north pole. I set my alarm to wake up and watch the stars but my alarm was deactivated by someone while I slept and it never went off. we were going to go to the church movie night at mom's church.

last night was really energetic and nice. the sky was extremely clear and I had begun to get that crispness back in my vision (not realising it was the eclipse that was providing the extra energy). it felt like they wanted to do some plan where I go and meet the girls, and the weird thing was, I didn't really feel very much resistance to the idea. I set my alarm, cause I wanted to catch a 40-50 minute nap before going back out. they deactivated my alarm and I didn't wake up until the morning. when I woke up I was surprisingly conscious throughout my dream state. the dreams seemed pretty clear, but I noticed later that they had (and also while watching stars) a feeling of unreality to them -- like not really definite.
