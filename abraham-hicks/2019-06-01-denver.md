#### context


#### questions I would ask...

if I were able to go to a workshop this year, I imagine that this one would probably be the most likely. I am beginning to compile a list of the questions I would ask here.

I'm not even going to attempt to try to make this happen. instead, this is a test, to see how well law of attraction works :) I figure, if there is enough desire for me to ask these questions, LOA will make it so. so, let's see how well it works..

---

1. if the whole girls thing had of happened, would I have very quickly got my visual capacity? if so, is the strong desire for me *not* to have my visual capacity actually the primary cause for things being held up?

2. why are my eyes blurry all the time? (I have lots of reasons why I think this is happening) is it true that other people see out of my eyes considerably better than I do? how can I see out of my eyes clearly?

3. I seem to easily come into alignment with my desire to cultivate the capacity to conjure images in my eyes and in 3d space -- however I often get shocked or something. how can I come into alignment with my desire without getting shocked?
