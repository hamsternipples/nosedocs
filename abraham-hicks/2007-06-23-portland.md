#### 31 - A school principal asks What about conformity

(!!! pages of positive aspects !!!)

(... quote about purposefully oblivious to bad behaviour and only seeing their success ...)

#### 33 - Your perception of your life is everything

about teleportation and other bending perception of time and space

#### 35 - Change your thinking and change your finances

I don't like my life, so I'm changing it all

> that's not really making peace with where you are

my life, as I have lived it, has put all kinds of things in my vibrational escrow that I'm looking forward to embracing and experiencing. and, I'm feeling nothing but appreciation for the life that put all of that there.
