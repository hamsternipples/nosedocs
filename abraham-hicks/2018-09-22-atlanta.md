my disillusionment has grown to such heights now that I pretty much have given up on the whole thing entirely. steadily, more and more I am realising the new personality of saturn. it's quite strange how different he is. I still have bouts of strong negative emotion, but it's getting considerably better..

leading up to this event, there was hurricane florence and along with it came with lots of clear night skies, whilch allowed for some visual capacity progression. I also had another one the night following this workshop. whatever happens in the workshop, it seems that things change drastically as a result. the most notable of these sorts of events were for example, meeting serenity and olivia or meeting aaron and the people at the new day(?) bbq.

I find myself today feeling quite a bit more sure of myself and what appears to be a considerable vision improvement after last night's star watching. I've really come to a strong resolution that I will simply find my own way for right now.

it is possible that this whole thing is just a big episode of learning how LOA works for oneself individually, not needing others to do things or conditions to be just right. I have a new conspiracy theory regarding this, too.

anyway... leading up to this workshop, I have been devouring the @[abe](2004-05-01) workshop. quite intense how much more relevant their older workshops are to me now.
