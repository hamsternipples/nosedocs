## have you ever thought about the possibility...

(a letter to mom, concerning the predicament that we're in, as I'm beginning to kind of see through their illusion)

that all of these sales and real estate things are just a big sham to keep you in financial bondage?

I say this because when your phone rang, I looked at it and I didn't see who it was (my vision is far too blurry to see stuff like that) but I felt a reaction to my looking at the phone. normally, I wouldn't really think much about it but when I was out eating the sandwiches it seemed to make sense to on an emotional level.

I will now enumerate some ideas:

1. you say I'm not the centre of attention, but based on various reactions to things I've written, I think my form of perception either indirectly or directly affects more than 50% of their product. therefore, you must imagine then that I am quite valuable to them, and they would probably need to protect their investment "at all costs"

2. I am pretty certain they are trying to keep me in financial bondage as well, considering that if I had any amount of money I would smoke weed relatively regularly and I would be gaining influence and interfacing with people (things they don't want). financial bondage is the easiest way for them to ensure that I don't have the money to be out in less controllable social interactions (just the brain injury group).

3. I could see why they may want to control who you interface with (and confide in, when you have to let off steam about the situation we're all in). I could also see how keeping you in financial bondage would be beneficial because it means less probability you have to support me. you're always trying to buy me things to help and stuff and they probably would want to keep that to be only purchases you can afford (so say like $50).

4. you've already expressed instances where it seems they're trying to prevent you from having certain dreams, so that means you're under 24/7 surveillance also, and they're actively trying to keep you from something in your dream state.. you're important to them, so they need to make sure you, like me, do not ever make any progress.

5. I could imagine them doing a sort of setup similar to the disconnect that has been happening to me with my programming, where they take you to these locations that are lavish, get you to confide in them about your situation, get you all pumped up about some real estate thing. they probably teach some form of dependence on their formula, then when you get home to try it, you find yourself completely unmotivated and unable to make the connection into real actual progress, because everything is all jumbled around and no longer feels good.

6. you may be wondering at this point, what about the other people there at the conferences? well, people are easy to dupe. they're probably real people and it's probably a somewhat real conference, too. I think about my past where I was wondering the same exact thing, thinking to myself, man they must have paid everyone off. in reality, those people were already going to be in those places, and they were willing to take orders from the voice inside their head.

7. they've probably improved on their technique and don't give direct commands very often any more to people in their head. I have often wondered if they've moved to putting ideas in people's heads, instead. you can imagine how valuable this would be if you were a young man working for amazon and you wanted to have the ability to plant ideas in your date's head and have those ideas feel good to them. the same technique is probably used to manage large groups of people without giving them orders.

8. an example, I can think of was the last two times you took stuff away from me: my star watching gear and my weed. were those direct orders, or were they seemingly really good ideas that popped into your head right as soon as you walked away? I say this because I've been tracking these "good ideas" that seem implanted in my head, and they seem to come as a response to the previous set of events.

just some ideas to think about. remember they are "relentless" and they have to do things "at any cost"

a few more things I thought of:

1. I've noticed that it seems to be about a rate of 4 in 5 times when we're talking about my situation, you seem to get a call from these sales guys or have to disappear to a training. for me this seems to be evidence that they are behind the trainings and are using them or the phone calls to try and cut the conversation short.

2. I've been really coming to get to know their ways about saying one thing and then acting in a completely opposite manner. the most notable of this is likely the way the way that they present the girls situation, and then actively sabotage any outcome that they don't like. it's understandable because they're the "authorities" so anything they don't like, they should try and actively ensure that behaviour and conditions are as they see fit.

3. when I ever needed to blow off some steam, daniel would show up (he was like my babysitter in spain) and he would try and get me to talk as much as possible to him because he was under their control. any time that I began to open up to a person in a random bar or whatever about my situation, I could tell that they did not want me talking to them, because I would say things that probably didn't fit in line with the image they were presenting to the public (see #2 about saying one thing and doing the opposite), so interfacing with the public was something they tried to avoid by giving me a designated person to confide in. I think this is likely happening to you as well.

if I think of more I'll add them
