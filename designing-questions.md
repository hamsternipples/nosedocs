question

---------

a question may have an answer that I am opposed to, because I feel like the answer may make me feel bad.

for example, when I was in the pueblo and I did my test where I did not look at my penis in the shower on purpose. instead I waited to look at it out in the middle of nowhere (where there could not possibly be any cameras), I still got a reaction to what I saw. I thought perhaps they had some sort of super duper zoom technology, but instead began to realise that other people could in fact see what I see. I rejected this answer to my problem for a little bit because it made me feel bad. so I looked at what part of it made me feel bad. I did recognise that source energy is seeing through my eyes and hearing, smelling, etc. -- every part of my physical experience along with me. I knew that is how non-physical has a physical experience: by focusing through our sensory apparatus along with us. remembering that made me feel better. however, non-physical doesn't judge. they have the benefit of seeing the bigger picture, where even what we would call the worst of behaviour eventually has benefit. so, as a result, there is no behaviour that I will receive a strong negative reaction from them.

however, I was in fact receiving negative reactions to my behaviour. and, I was noticing, that the more attention I gave to the reactions, the more I noticed them. it took me a bit to figure this one out, but there is nothing I can do to modify other people's reactions to my behaviour. I could attempt to try and please my audience by behaving in a way which they react to better. however, that is a futile effort because in almost everything I was doing, I could feel both positive and negative reactions. the real thing I eventually realised is that the reactions that I felt had more to do with me and how I felt than people reacting to my behaviour.

concepts <-> concepts

there are some words which link the two

concepts should be:
- zero
  - evidence based
  - data based
- one
  - idea based
  - feeling based
- two
  - logic based
  - appearance based
- three
  - principal based (whether true or not, doesn't matter)
  - desire based
