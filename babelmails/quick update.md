quick update:

I tried meditating. I've concluded that I do better without it, and don't not want to meditate right now. the ups and downs which result from a quieted mind are so much bigger, I prefer to steadily improve how I feel by guiding my thoughts.

the influence I receive which is preventing my visual capacity during my wake state is also making me feel pretty bad, and while that does prevent me from feeling good enough to see images - it also holds me away from my vortex, and so ultimately I believe I will remain in pretty much the same place I am right now for some time more. time may need to pass though, and it's ok because every iteration it gets bigger and better, so sure... why not, right?

I could ask for the device to be removed, or I could find a way of disabling it myself -- but then, that would mean that the guys in charge will not have made the decision, and I would have acted in opposition to their desire. I could force it, but I suppose I really want them to choose to disable the device (I know how much frustration it causes me when they override my desires and force me to do things their way, so I have personal experience of how that would feel if I were to do that to them). that way they would be given the opportunity to choose it for themselves (also something I can relate to and understand how important it will be for them to choose it). though, I don't mind so much if they do not wish to change, and think many future kids like me will benefit greatly from learning that no one ultimately has any power over anyone's experience. so, part of me wants to instead find a way of bypassing its effects so they can remain exactly how they are and teach other lucky kids this valuable understanding in their continual efforts to control others' experiences in effort to soothe their insecurity..

plus, I think all the extra pain along the way might make them think I've really earned it a lot more, so they'll be able to perceive me as more worthy, I guess lol. I'll just keep finding novel ways of getting around the pain cause by increased energy while learning how to reduce resistance at the same time. fun stuff for a masochist :)

I'm passing the baton to you guys. I'll stay here for now and continue to become more and more satisfied with what-is. I promise I won't smoke weed (so I don't feel too good so nothing will move forward and I won't see any images). I will spend any extra good feeling (serotonin) I obtain from reducing my resistance on improving my vision (dmt) and I'll only take ibuprofen as a defensive measure to stabilise myself after they bump up the power level on their end to prevent me from seeing images.
