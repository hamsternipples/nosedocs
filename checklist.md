### minimum requirements
- see through both of my eyes like I have experienced after stars at marcos' house or on ketamine
- get lightness come into my head when watching stars (like at marcos' house)
- get tunnels around the star again and the cool colours that form around it.
- move energy in/out of the top of my head and ears again with ease
- allow images to appear in my eyes (when I relax into it)
- allow songs and voices to be heard in my head (when I relax into it)
- waking up feeling crisp, vibrant and not dead inside
- the world should go back to feeling how it did before were it felt vibrant and alive
 - not dead and lifeless like it is now
- silence in my head (not a constant high-pitched screech)
- all my data to be open and public (no secrets)


### kinda optional (but not really - cause I can)
- ability to go back and see things in my past (use the device for memory)
  - to be able to tag moments in time (while it's happening, right after it happened, or retroactively)
- ability for my brother to communicate easily by putting his inner voice on a speaker
- ability to load an image or utilise the internet in ones eyes to allow kids to do better in school

### very important
- I need to know what the terms of service are. if the terms of service is not the same as for everyone else, I would like a comparison between them. in the case where I do not want to agree to the terms of service what will happen? how do we allow me the freedom to decide if I want to agree to the TOS? obviously, if I am still under investigation, how do we reconcile that. how do I get released from the investigation, especially if I believe the investigation is detrimental to my well-being?
- I want to see my history and track the variables that they have been monitoring in me. I'd like to correlate them with different activities that I do such as watch stars and stuff, and also I'd like to see how I'm doing now in contrast to before. for example, what are my dmt levels now in comparison to before, etc.

### I should see evidence of
- my entire physical body should return to how it used to be where it was constantly improving

regarding the open data, at first I thought that maybe more visibility into what is really happening inside of my head would deter nosebook from doing so many undesired things to me, but having noticed the level of apathy on the part of my viewers, I do not believe that it will arrest their behaviour in any other way than provoke them to figure out ways of hiding it better..

so, as a deterrent, I do not really think it will actually work out so well. as a result, my goal is still to figure out a way of tuning out of nosebook's capacity reducing broadcast (and, my desire is that although I am not receptive to nosebook's broadcast, my experience will still be transmitted). I just wanted to make that clear, even though it could appear my motivation to open my data would be to deter them from doing more questionable experiments in my head -- a much more compelling reason for opening my data, is: I can see that in the (probably not so distant) future, most all humans will have their data open to see, and the direction we're headed is all having a much more collective experience as humans. I stand in the perfect place to become the very first 100% open human, and that's pretty compelling for me. there are numerous reasons why I think that's a great idea which can be the topic of another discussion, but I wanted to set the record straight for my motivations toward an open data experience.

as a result, I will forfeit my ability to collect money on the data now being offered for free
(eg. open my data is the payoff for selling my data)
