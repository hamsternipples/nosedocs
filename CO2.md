##### 2018-08-14 14:29 - is CO2 instrumental to the creation of clouds and rain?

I just watched a video on youtube about how many wildfires are in california. there was one response which stuck out to me:

```
Everyone talks about California getting wildfires, (which is all fine), but no one seems to be talking about Oregon and Washington getting wildfires it seems.

In most years, OR and WA have seen far larger and worse fires than California relative to the size of their states (although with much less destroyed housing and property by far). Based on historic burn maps of the U.S., the most heavily burned regions are located in the Pacific Northwest. It's sad to see all our beautiful forests and mountains on fire–especially as an avid hiker, myself. A history of wildfire suppression, intense/unrestrained logging leading to dense re-growth in past years, and climate change (causing lower spring snowpacks and drier summers) have all made fires worse in Oregon and Washington. We need to do more controlled burns, halt ALL logging on public lands, fight climate change, and designate more protected land to to save our last remaining old growth trees that are more resistant to wildfires.﻿

I have often wondered about the CO2 thing, because there are a lot of airplanes in the sky which should be producing massive amounts of CO2, then it seems to me that the vapour that they are emitting, their "contrails" are also CO2. so, it seems that a lot of carbon is being put into the air. I have noticed that the more carbon in the air, the hazier things look, but also the easier clouds can form. I had often wondered what makes clouds, because they would often form right inbetween me and the star I was trying to watch. then I found gerald pollack's presentation on EZ (exclusion zone) water, which talks about water in its 4th state and its electrical properties in that state.

after a few really intense nights watching lightning happen inside of the clouds when I was trying to watch stars, I began to warm up to the idea that clouds were sort of evidence of something else happening, much like smoke is to a fire. I mentioned this to jaron one day and then my theory began to take shape.

I think that fire is to rain, as smoke is to clouds. so, when you see smoke, a fire is about to become visible. fire is evidence of the oxidisation of carbon, eg. CO2 being created. so, what if clouds are evidence of rain, not the cause. before a fire begins, there is smouldering for a while, then all of a sudden a flame bursts forth and the smoke becomes significantly less. if the clouds are the smoke, then you should see smouldering for a while (heavy cloud growth), then it should all of a sudden begin raining after some threshold has been passed. often times a lightning strike will occur right before it begins to rain, so that must mean that there is some sort of electrical thing that is occurring.

let's go back to EZ water now. it is H3O2. the key here is the O2 bit, because that is ozone. ozone is created when lightning strikes and can be smelled quite easily after a tesla coil has been run for a while. now, I am quite deficient in chemistry understanding, but it seems to me that only carbon is needed to make CO2 from O2. however according to this page on air ions:

https://www.n-ion.com/e/theory.html#02-b

```
Electrons are released from molecules in the air when radiant or cosmic rays in the atmosphere collide with the molecules. These electrons are absorbed by molecules (e.g. oxygen or carbon dioxide) in the air to form negative ions. Actually, they combine with water molecules to exist stably.

Here are some examples of small negative ions.
Oxide molecule ion: O2- + (H2O)n
Carbon dioxide ion: CO3- + (H2O)n
Nitric acid ion: NO3- + (H2O)n
"-" of O2-/CO3-/NO3- means a neutral molecule in the air has received an electron.

"n" of (H2O)n shows the number of water molecules and it changes depending on humidity.

A large negative ion is formed when a small ion is absorbed by a larger particle.
```

so it looks like ionisation of O2 and CO2 suck water (H2O) out of the air to form clouds.

O2 seems to be important because it is the byproduct of photosynthesis, according to this page: https://www.lenntech.com/carbon-dioxide.htm

The part carbon dioxide plays in environmental processes
Carbon dioxide is one of the most abundant gasses in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide plays an important part in vital plant and animal process, such as photosynthesis and respiration. These processes will be briefly explained here.

Green plants convert carbon dioxide and water into food compounds, such as glucose, and oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis.

The reaction of photosynthesis is as follows:
6 CO2 + 6 H2O --> C6H12O6 + 6 O2

Plants and animals, in turn, convert the food compounds by combining it with oxygen to release energy for growth and other life activities. This is the respiration process, the reverse of photosynthesis.

The respiration reaction is as follows:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 --> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

Photosynthesis and respiration play an important role in the carbon cycle and are at equilibrium with one another.
Photosynthesis dominates during the warmer part of the year and respiration dominates during the colder part of the year. However, both processes occur the entire year. Overall, then, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decreases during the growing season and increases during the rest of the year.
Because the seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres are opposite, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing in the north while decreasing in the south, and vice versa. The cycle is more clearly present in the northern hemisphere; because it has relatively more land mass and terrestrial vegetation. Oceans dominate the southern hemisphere.

Influence of carbon dioxide on alkalinity

Carbon dioxide can change the pH of water. This is how it works:

Carbon dioxide dissolves slightly in water to form a weak acid called carbonic acid, H2CO3, according to the following reaction:
CO2 + H2O --> H2CO3

After that, carbonic acid reacts slightly and reversibly in water to form a hydronium cation, H3O+, and the bicarbonate ion, HCO3-, according to the following reaction:
H2CO3 + H2O --> HCO3- + H3O+
```


so, what if all of these wildfires are just a way to get more carbon into the air so that more clouds can be formed, so that more rain can happen, so that things can cool down?
