so why do I really want to do mdma again?
what does it symbolise to me?

maybe, that I want to feel like I am once again in control of my emotions
maybe, that I want to feel like I am accomplishing new discoveries in myself
maybe, because I am sure that I can conquer that territory

---

what would be the hidden benefit of missing my goal?
(to help me process failing the goal so I don't have to shame myself for failing the goal)

am I looking to achieve this goal to make myself different than I am now?

I do not. I believe it will be an expansion of who I already am.
