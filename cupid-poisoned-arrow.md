It dawned on me that women who do not orgasm easily might actually be ahead of the rest of us—provided they realize there is no reason to amp up unnecessary frustration in pursuit of the "Holy Grail" of orgasm. At some level women who don't settle for orgasm as the measure of their sex- ual satisfaction may be holding out for the bonding behaviors that would deepen their relationships and offer both partners more satisfaction. It may even be that gende, generous lovemaking, with no performance objectives, is the best possible way for women to unblock their sexual energy, and that forced orgasms only make it more difficult for them to fall into relaxed, openhearted, union.

This meant that if men wished to become "safe pilots," to use Taoist terminology, they needed to learn sexual self-discipline. But women needed to check their inner temptresses at the bedroom door and find other satisfying ways of nurturing their mates. Both sexes would have to move beyond their automatic responses if they wanted to experiment with the mystery of bonding-based sex.

Lasting contentment is bad for genes. If you have your children with different mates due to your inability to remain faithful, their immune systems and other traits will be less similar. So, for example, if a deadly new organism appears, chances are better that one of your children will be able to fight it off. This is one reason genes drive us to have affairs, divorce and remarry, and avoid incest.


Dopamine is released in response to expectations—rather than actual levels of pleasure.


#### notes

dopamine seems to be relatable to pleasure, and serotonin to happiness

I want to contemplate (and find out more) what is happening in my brain with regard to reward circuitry -- because I do not remember the effects of cocaine to be how they describe in the book. I do not experience a "down" time -- and neither from mdma (which it is also reported to have a big down the following day). it seems that I am not as driven by this reward circuitry as the book describes. I don't discount what it is saying though, because for example I do experience those effects with marijuana (previously) cigarettes and various other things when I was younger. what I mean is, it may be possible that the rational brain may have some sort of effect on this reward system. every time I quit smoking I learned something new about the addiction's attractive power.

it seems that all things exhibit both attractive and repulsive power. this book greatly outlines these principals in a way which reminds me, for some reason, of gravity.
