originally, the 7 layers were:

1° monad
2° atmic
3° buddhic
4° abstract mind
5° soul (mid-point: beginning of translation into form)
6° mental
7° astral

the 7 layers thing reminds me a bit of the network stack where it's an overly-complicated thing that the kernel does and user space has to just fit into this mould of how things are done. while I do think that the 7 layers are genius, and have found them to be very helpful in understanding many concepts, I feel like it's sort of like a compartmentalised standard that all userspace programs need to adhere to.

when I say userspace programs, I imagine that all galaxies need to utilise the protocol stack of the 7-layers just like all programs need to talk to the kernel so that the kernel can do the right thing with the data. tcp/ip is the "right way" of doing things. anyway, along came this idea that someone wanted to make a p2p file-sharing program (torrent), and tcp/ip just was way too slow to do that kind of thing, so it built it's own safety mechanisms to ensure the transfer was successful (hash), and used udp as the network protocol, spitting packets out and not caring if their delivery was successful.

I remember this caused a huge change in mindset as to how to transfer data. various other protocols have been built on top of udp which do a similar thing as tcp/ip.

however, I think the takeaway from this story is not that tcp/ip is bad, because it's not, just it's a whole lot of extra overhead to provide guarantees and safety at a packet level.

so, instead of forcing everyone to utilise the same mechanisms for packet safety, a lot of these layers could become userspace, and an application which doesn't need safety (like a game observer, or a broadcast) can be treated the way that it feels best. for example for a torrent, you do not need to guarantee every packet is correct, instead depending on the size of the torrent, it's verified after it's received the full chunk of 4KB to 4MB.

another interesting thing I find about the transition from the previous layers to the present layers, is that 3° is what we would call now the "source energy" or 4° layer now, and in-between the atmic and the source layer a different layer was added: structure. then, abstract mind got moved down below source (4°) into physical form in the emotion (5°) layer and the soul, mental, and astral planes all got smooshed into the imagination (6°) layer and the physical one was added.

it's almost as if the layer model got flipped inside out to make room for the physical layer.

one of the things that we as humans struggle so much to do is to try and make things happen. this is the structure layer where we determine that achieving certain things means other things, and there is a logic to how that is all done. the desired outcome and almost all of that logic is imagined.

the added layers are structure which connects to imagination, and the previous layers with form or meaning, have become the imagination. to ensure this works properly, the imagination was placed between the physical layer (visible form), and the abstract mind (emotional/conceptual) layer. our emotions are directly connected to source, so anything we feel is a reflection of your perception (imagination) of what you're giving your attention to.
