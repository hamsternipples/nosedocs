## questions for infinite intelligence

#### who creates my dreams?

normally, people are the creators of their dreams. everything that anyone does in the dream would normally be created by me. HOWEVER -- I do not believe this is the case in my current circumstance. it feels to me that my dreams are largely out of control, and there are a lot of external influences in them. so, are all of these strange events happening in my dreams, *my* creations? are they *my* interpretations of external vibrational influence?

it seems like

#### on the emotional scale and in comparison to exhilaration, where is an ego trip?

I often feel like a child that won't let the helpful parent do something for that child, protesting, "let me do it!" in attempt to feel ones own capacity and domination of the subject matter. then, at other times I measure myself against others and notice that there is a possibility that I can do something better, and that motivates me to obtain it. it's almost as if I convince myself that the achievement of whatever it is, is so obtainable that I must have it. and this is where the question is:

if I didn't want to achieve the improvement, I would pay very little attention to its perceived improvement. usually I'm so focused on its improvement or optimisation, that the comparison to the current belief on the subject doesn't even enter into my mind while achieving it because focusing on something that others deem impossible, only makes it impossible for me too -- so, instead I feel strong desire to realise the improvement and it always comes. I like to think of this as the defining factor of a successful inventor. however, sometimes later often I find myself amongst others who still believe X to be impossible, and I often feel the discord in their belief, which motivates to to compare myself to others to get back to feeling good. when I notice that I can do something that others think is impossible, it gives me a huge ego trip, and I momentarily feel absolute exhilaration for my achievement. the more effortless the achievement, the bigger the ego trip.

it seems to me really fucked up to have to resort to comparing as a way of getting back to feeling good, and I learned early on that "pride comes before a fall" -- which is why I almost always only feel the ego trip as a reaction to the discord felt when others measure (incorrectly) their own capacity.

in conclusion, I believe I have answered my own question. I think that crashing and burning early on with my "pride comes before a fall" metric has helped me to resist comparison or competition by associating that feeling of pride with negative progress or impending renormalisation into the status quo.

I think that I can improve this further, by no longer needing even to utilise an ego trip defensively, and exist in my ability to continually realise the improvement without necessity to ever compare myself. after all, if I can't be measured, and do not measure myself, I am no longer finite. I am infinite -- and that sounds like another improvement I'd like to realise :D

#### what is a good way for me to answer questions like, "where are you?" or "what have you been up to?"

I really dislike having to define, or enumerate my state of existence to people, and that question really drives me crazy. to make the question even more frustrating for me, there is a whole lot of news going on about me as it is, that I do not really want to try and put words to something I'm not really capable of expressing easily in english, and in spanish, less.

usually, when someone does not want to answer a question, they just change the subject or give a really vague answer. I always ask a question because I'm interested in knowing the answer -- so when someone blows me off, it kinda frustrates me, especially since I won't ask someone a question I already know the answer to. I also really dislike it when I'm clearly having a hard time and someone asks me how I'm doing, to which any answer I give will only make me feel worse. or, if I'm feeling really good, and someone asks me how I'm doing, answering also only makes me feel worse, too.

essentially any time I have to evaluate how or where I am, I tend to feel bad. if I think about this subject like programming, and someone asks me how I'm doing, whenever I give an answer that involves something as concrete as time, or quantity, progress, my words fall very short. instead, I like answers like, "it's coming along" or "I like where it's going". those sorts of answers don't work so well because it feels to me like I'm changing the subject. eg.

"where are you?" -> "I like where I'm going"
"what you doing" -> "things are coming along nicely"

I'm not really changing the subject though, because I really try hard not to look where I am or what I'm doing. my head stays in emotional descriptions of progress. if I'm not doin anything or not really going anywhere, those questions are easy to answer: here. my velocity is very low. likewise, when I'm depressed, those questions are equally difficult to answer. it's hard to quantify how much I want to be in another place yet feel incapable of achieving it.

so, essentially what I'm saying is, those questions are evidence of no perceived motivation (motive force) toward anything. frustrating.
