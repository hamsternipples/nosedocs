# the list

these are the girls that I had a notable enough good feeling about that I want to remember them here.

- the girl that just moved in to end of carefree (23?)
- the girl with the chaotic writing (and her friend) that I missed in the multi-family yard sale down on gamble 155
- a few weeks ago (or maybe it was last friday? I dunno), I saw a few people walking around in the appartments that I usually cross (the preserve), and I saw them walking toward the centre area near to the pool, when all of a sudden I decided that I wanted to go a different way, making it so that I didn't walk past them. I sort of feel obligated to follow my instinct, so I just do what pops into my head that feels good. anyway, I didn't know what that was about, but since then I've thought about it a few times... I figured at the time that they would just need to try again another time when desire was stronger or something. I really didn't know. I just have to follow my instinct. it's had me thinking about it since because what if me following my instinct *was* actually what was the clarifying thing to build stronger desire. I dunno. anyway, it was cool because it helped me to realise that following inspiration may be the "right path" -- but it could also be the "right way" to build more desire. either way following inspiration is the correct thing to do, and then just let it sort itself out later. so, if that was a thing, then sure. (I'm not really sure it was)
- whatever happened with with what I was feeling with poncho has improved tramendously, however, now I'm just not sure what I was feeling anymore. it's totally gone, however, I think he's a cool guy and I like they way he feels a lot now, so yes, if that was a thing. I don't feel anymore conflict anymore, and I'm sure everything is all good there.

- about an hour ago I was outside and I heard a girl make a screaming sound, and it reminded me of another time that I was walking back on briargate and heard a girl make a similar screaming sound from a house with a trampoline -- probably on newpark(?). anyway, she reminded me of that, and I want to invite them both.

- in the video where robert is talking about hungarian gypsies, there is a girl dancing in front here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/QvKp1WKc-MQ?t=114). as I was taking a shower I was feeling different things...

so, this is where I pause to wonder to myself wtf is going on, cause this video was produced in march 2019, which means the footage is a little older. my mind is specifically geared to suspect the most extreme and then work my way back to reality from there. however, if I begin to explain, I will launch off into a multi-page explanation much longer than what I want to put here, so I'll just leave it as a suspicion because I don't really understand how this could logically be happening unless something quite a bit bigger is happening. I just don't know, and additionally it's really weird because when watching the video again just now to get the timestamp, I have this extremely familiar feeling with her, as if I know her, but I assure you I don't and very likely (judging by the architecture) we're in different continents as well -- so I'm totally puzzled about this and how it could be happening, yet at the same time my heart is like kinda jumping around with excitement too. I dunno...

- walking home, I saw a guy walking on the field near to me, and I didn't think much about it, and then a thought popped into my head that he wanted me to invite his daughter. I thought it was a terribly strange idea, but it persisted. anyway, I decided I'm gonna go with it... welcome :)

- walking home, I met dan, poncho's socio. we shook hands, and then when I got home, I started to realise that he must have met me for a reason. it feels like his daughter or something. anyway, I quite like the way she feels. welcome :)
- dang well, it's really hard for me to locate what I'm feeling here on this one because it feels like there are more than one different signal. in this same video, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/QvKp1WKc-MQ?t=114), I believe I can feel the one in the back with the red and the white pretty strongly. however, I just don't know. I'm just going to say that if any of the girls there in the back that are playing around there that want to join, I think is fine. I don't have anything that says no and it actually feels pretty good, too.
- as I was going out to the field and a few other times as well, I was reminded of this girl in pink shoes I saw very briefly in what looks like isreal: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Bny_mt_6N-I?t=812). yo, I dunno cause I don't really feel her very strongly, however the idea did pass through my head a few times, which honestly doesn't really mean a whole lot either cause lots of thoughts pass through my head... anyway, not really feeling anything solid on it, I'm gonna let it sit for now. however, I did want to write about it so that LOA begins to take effect and either amplifies what I don't really feel right now, or brings about something more in line with what is really wanted.
