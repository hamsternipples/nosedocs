# the list

these are the girls that I had a notable enough good feeling about that I want to remember them here.

### 2020-08-25 13:43

- the girl that just moved in to end of carefree (23?)
- the girl with the chaotic writing (and her friend) that I missed in the multi-family yard sale down on gamble 155
- a few weeks ago (or maybe it was last friday? I dunno), I saw a few people walking around in the appartments that I usually cross (the preserve), and I saw them walking toward the centre area near to the pool, when all of a sudden I decided that I wanted to go a different way, making it so that I didn't walk past them. I sort of feel obligated to follow my instinct, so I just do what pops into my head that feels good. anyway, I didn't know what that was about, but since then I've thought about it a few times... I figured at the time that they would just need to try again another time when desire was stronger or something. I really didn't know. I just have to follow my instinct. it's had me thinking about it since because what if me following my instinct *was* actually what was the clarifying thing to build stronger desire. I dunno. anyway, it was cool because it helped me to realise that following inspiration may be the "right path" -- but it could also be the "right way" to build more desire. either way following inspiration is the correct thing to do, and then just let it sort itself out later. so, if that was a thing, then sure. (I'm not really sure it was)
- whatever happened with with what I was feeling with poncho has improved tramendously, however, now I'm just not sure what I was feeling anymore. it's totally gone, however, I think he's a cool guy and I like they way he feels a lot now, so yes, if that was a thing. I don't feel anymore conflict anymore, and I'm sure everything is all good there.

- about an hour ago I was outside and I heard a girl make a screaming sound, and it reminded me of another time that I was walking back on briargate and heard a girl make a similar screaming sound from a house with a trampoline -- probably on newpark(?). anyway, she reminded me of that, and I want to invite them both.

### 2020-08-25 20:18

- in the video where robert is talking about hungarian gypsies, there is a girl dancing in front here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/QvKp1WKc-MQ?t=114). as I was taking a shower I was feeling different things...

so, this is where I pause to wonder to myself wtf is going on, cause this video was produced in march 2019, which means the footage is a little older. my mind is specifically geared to suspect the most extreme and then work my way back to reality from there. however, if I begin to explain, I will launch off into a multi-page explanation much longer than what I want to put here, so I'll just leave it as a suspicion because I don't really understand how this could logically be happening unless something quite a bit bigger is happening. I just don't know, and additionally it's really weird because when watching the video again just now to get the timestamp, I have this extremely familiar feeling with her, as if I know her, but I assure you I don't and very likely (judging by the architecture) we're in different continents as well -- so I'm totally puzzled about this and how it could be happening, yet at the same time my heart is like kinda jumping around with excitement too. I dunno...

### 2020-08-26 09:58

- walking home, I saw a guy walking on the field near to me, and I didn't think much about it, and then a thought popped into my head that he wanted me to invite his daughter. I thought it was a terribly strange idea, but it persisted. anyway, I decided I'm gonna go with it... welcome :)

### 2020-08-27 14:17

- walking home, I met dan, poncho's socio. we shook hands, and then when I got home, I started to realise that he must have met me for a reason. it feels like his daughter or something. anyway, I quite like the way she feels. welcome :)
- dang well, it's really hard for me to locate what I'm feeling here on this one because it feels like there are more than one different signal. in this same video, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/QvKp1WKc-MQ?t=114), I believe I can feel the one in the back with the red and the white pretty strongly. however, I just don't know. I'm just going to say that if any of the girls there in the back that are playing around there that want to join, I think is fine. I don't have anything that says no and it actually feels pretty good, too.
- as I was going out to the field and a few other times as well, I was reminded of this girl in pink shoes I saw very briefly in what looks like isreal: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Bny_mt_6N-I?t=812). yo, I dunno cause I don't really feel her very strongly, however the idea did pass through my head a few times, which honestly doesn't really mean a whole lot either cause lots of thoughts pass through my head... anyway, not really feeling anything solid on it, I'm gonna let it sit for now. however, I did want to write about it so that LOA begins to take effect and either amplifies what I don't really feel right now, or brings about something more in line with what is really wanted.

### 2020-08-29 09:41

- in the previous entry I mentioned this girl here, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Bny_mt_6N-I?t=812) yet I still have not felt her, wait well kinda now... ok, well I'll just let it build but, what I think happened is that the reactions I felt were nosebook, not the girl. as a result, I was going to say that nevermind about her, but I can definitely feel her now, so nevermind that.
- also, in the previous entry, I mentioned the girls here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/QvKp1WKc-MQ?t=114), and I said that any of them who wanted can join, but then later I felt some chaos over it, so I'm going to change it to the ones that I originally felt which were the one in the red and white on the right in the previous one, then I suppose I'm feeling, and therefore going to add the one in pink on the right as for sure (@[youtube](https://youtu.be/QvKp1WKc-MQ?t=791)). then, I can maybe kinda feel the and also the one in pink on the left and maybe the one in the orange too, but I'll let them develop a little more.
- when I was watching this video for the first time, @[youtube](https://youtu.be/kc7OJmZrGcQ?t=77), I can't remember because I can't really feel it now, but I think I felt something like really really strongly with this girl here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/kc7OJmZrGcQ?t=77). however, like I said I definitely don't feel it now. I just wanted to mention it... like wtf, I seriously have no idea what happened... was it this one? @[youtube](https://youtu.be/kc7OJmZrGcQ?t=40). I'm gonna let it develop too.
- also, yesterday when I was writing to daniel about my difficulties with work, I was feeling this weird feeling from a girl which didn't want me to sabotage my conversation with daniel. I dunno who or where she is, and it's weird anyway, but (I have no idea, because it feels like I'm making this stuff up, maybe a little and at this point I'm kinda doubting things but anyway...) it felt like someone like daniel's girlfriend's sister or something like that. yep. something like that, anyway yep. definitely yes.
- yesterday, right after crossing troy, there was a car just passing me. I felt something yesterday and today I was reminded about how important it is that I remember her. ok, sure :)
- lastly, when I was out at the field, I was thinking about lyia, and I mean I already said yes, but catch me if you can :)

ok, there we go. I went to the field this morning and I'm telling you it's kinda like really weird because all of the difficulties I have feeling some of them and then other times it seems like they return a moment. it's strange and I haven't felt out the pattern quite yet, but I'm starting to get there where I can feel them more and more. nice :)

it was funny to me too because I understood that the different girls can get whatever it is that they want. some can choose to do the black tantra route or the white tantra route, and that has one effect. some will be more motivaated by the audience and/or directors, and others will wait to procreate with me, and others will do other different things too. it's not like they're all going to be the same. the ones who want to release their resistance to competition and allow their vibration to rise will join me in the source like perspective too.

I could see that a lot (most) of them will end up joining me there over some course of time, but we're gonna take the worst manifestation path forward so it's garanteed to be the "only improvements" from here path, which is where things just keep getting better as we move closer and closer toward manifestation. I know that as we go along, they'll all find their own way to whatever it is that they really want, their own ways. maybe not at first because nosebook wants to make sure that we make the most contrast manifestation, but as I continue to rise my vibration up and up, I think it's likely that I'll become aware that a lot of these different things are happening at once, and I'm just doing my own thing, keeping it on the one.

from my perspective, I just keep finding the way toward the best feeling spot, not needing the manifestation because if the manifestation hasn't happened yet, it means that I still have part of me which resists unwanted (evil). if I resist unwanted, I attract unwanted so I just keep going (know what I mean??). also, if the manifestation hasn't happened yet, it only means that there's still a bit more of an evolution to go, which makes the manifestation become more wanted (for everyone).

along the way, I'm going to throw out some bad ideas, ok? so just don't worry about them. they're probably pivot points to make it easier to find the frequency of what's wanted (for everyone). don't take me too seriously, or rather, I should say, someone has to get the bad ideas out there. no need to be scared or try to resist them from happening. (eg. there's a common idea that if I say a bad idea out loud, I will certainly attract it into my experience. this is not true if you can find the evolution, and focus on, and therefore attract, the evolved manifestation instead).

some more interesting additions here. I had some more thinking about the whole "resist not evil" idea, and I think it's totally all about my perception, and what I attract that matters. so here we go...

- the iran girl in robert's latest video here: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/kp6H0VSvi9Y?t=681)
- the girl across the street that just moved in that I was puzzled about.
- the girl I saw in the park while picking mushrooms today with a little dog.

dang, I can't really remember any more. when I walked through the park the day before yesterday, I felt some ideas, but nothing concrete. experience tells me that those ideas are likely nosebook, so I'm just going to let them sit for now.

man, I thought there were more than just three. it was a weird feeling because the magnitude of the feeling I had to want to make sure they were written down made it feel like there were more... dang... I can't wait to meet them :)
