# the list

these are the girls that I had a notable enough good feeling about that I want to remember them here.

- the girl that just moved in to end of carefree (23?)
- the girl with the chaotic writing (and her friend) that I missed in the multi-family yard sale down on gamble 155
- a few weeks ago (or maybe it was last friday? I dunno), I saw a few people walking around in the appartments that I usually cross (the preserve), and I saw them walking toward the centre area near to the pool, when all of a sudden I decided that I wanted to go a different way, making it so that I didn't walk past them. I sort of feel obligated to follow my instinct, so I just do what pops into my head that feels good. anyway, I didn't know what that was about, but since then I've thought about it a few times... I figured at the time that they would just need to try again another time when desire was stronger or something. I really didn't know. I just have to follow my instinct. it's had me thinking about it since because what if me following my instinct *was* actually what was the clarifying thing to build stronger desire. I dunno. anyway, it was cool because it helped me to realise that following inspiration may be the "right path" -- but it could also be the "right way" to build more desire. either way following inspiration is the correct thing to do, and then just let it sort itself out later. so, if that was a thing, then sure. (I'm not really sure it was)
- whatever happened with with what I was feeling with poncho has improved tramendously, however, now I'm just not sure what I was feeling anymore. it's totally gone, however, I think he's a cool guy and I like they way he feels a lot now, so yes, if that was a thing. I don't feel anymore conflict anymore, and I'm sure everything is all good there.

- about an hour ago I was outside and I heard a girl make a screaming sound, and it reminded me of another time that I was walking back on briargate and heard a girl make a similar screaming sound from a house with a trampoline -- probably on newpark(?). anyway, she reminded me of that, and I want to invite them both.
