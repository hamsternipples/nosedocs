# questions for abraham

as I'm listening to the 4 days a week livestream, I often inspire questions in me. I have no intention of askingt them directly, but they're kinda fun for me to write and think about the question, anyway.

### 2020-04-05 19:??

in the visual metaphor of the "gap" between me and where my inner being is, you gave me the image that as someone lives life their inner being continues to catch (and go with) the expansion that life provides, and sometimes you can close that gap (never can fully) between your physical reality and your vibrational (inner being) reality -- yet, if you don't close that gap, the image that I got is that because your inner being only focuses on your desires and never the gap, the gap would continue to widen and widen until it becomes no longer bearable and you finally die. if one is capable of continually closing that gap, would death continually be prolonged until that gap widens too much?

it seems to me that if that were the case (I think it probably is), then as life continues, the momentum gained by closing the gap would get one "moving" so rapidly, that either the gap would widen really really rapidly and death would come quickly. followup question: would it be possible to get so good at closing the gap, and have so much momentum in it, for life to no longer able to provide big enough contrast to maintain that momentum? (kinda far-fetched, and I know the first step is getting that kind of momentum, but I'm pretty sure I can accomplish it and was wondering.. I have no problem with dying so I think I would probably just want to experience it again with new eyes and just release my consciousness)

### 2020-04-05 19:??

esther was having difficuly reading the cards. however, from my experience, I find this to be unlikely. for me, the more connected I am, the more clarity my eyesight seems to have. does abraham unfocus (blur) esther's eyes because if she were to actually see with the clarity of that much connction, she would be mind-blown by the beauty of even the most mundane details, and this would take her out of the dream-like state she's in? I believe it is likely blurred.

#### I feel like...

probably abraham isn't blurring her vision. it's probably the network operators that feel that anytime someone has a lot of connection (DMT) then it needs to be controlled. I'll continue on with further questions in the future. cause, it begs the quesion, why is it necessary to blur our vision when we're connected? I feel like it's to ensure that we're not capable of visually creating 3d objects in space with our imagination.. anyway..

### 2020-04-05 19:??

that brings me to the followup: the other thing I've noticed is that my eyesight is a product of how much resistance (how much contradictory vibration) I'm offereing in relation to who I relly am. I have noticed on drug experiences, when I boost my DMT levels without releasing resistance, my vision improves, yet I feel a very strong "swooning" sensation, as if I'm "stepping back" or getting pulled sidways into a swirling vortex. this seems to happen because there is so much extra physical detail that my brain kind of overloads, as it's not yet used to that faster speed. if her vision weren't blurred would she feel constantly feel that overwheming sensation of so much detail?

### 2020-04-05 19:??

related to the last question: is that visual blurring what the guys at the network are doing to me? when I finally get connected will that amount of detail seem very overwhelming to me? every time tesla went through his massive visual upgrades, he would describe the world as being very difficult to live in, having the hearing accuity to hear flys landing and such (before he got used to it). when I finally get connected, will I have a similar experience? I have often times felt like I will need a period of time -- perhaps weeks or months to be able to accustom myself to the visual and auditory clarity that I am sure is there, even though is being withheld from me by the network operators. how long of a recovery time will I need?

### 2020-04-08 17:20 - (20-04-07|27:32)

one of the things that I was feeling the other day (I haven't slept since) was your words saying «we wouldn't fight against anything» -- giving me the impression that perhaps I should begin to become a "cooperative component" to nosebook and just let them do their stupid maintenance on me while I sleep[^1].  their maintenance doesn't really impede my ability to watch stars... it does affect my programming though -- but most of all, I have difficulty going to sleep because I typically feel so much better than I do after I awake...

in the presentation, you were talking about allowing: «you will never disconnect from your source energy and your well-being by wanting to be a helpful person to another» -- while that doesn't directly apply to my question, I do get the impression maybe I should start becoming more "cooperative".

---

one of the strange things that is the kind of person that I am, is I don't really want to give up te fight. I'm so comfortable and so good at continuing to get out ahead of their antics, and I can see that I continually get more and more vision upgrades too. I really want to continue to go on until I find a way to simply overpower them in some way -- or something like that. I know it's not exactly "allowing", right, but I'm just having so much fun with the feeling that *I* am the creator of my reality, and no matter how hard they try, I can still continue to surpass my number of vision upgrades per week number -- and at the same time I'm really getting a lot of practice. being the kind of extremist that I am, it seems that perhaps I'm almost going to the opposite extreme of victimhood, and I've become addicted to the visceral resistance they provide for my everyday experience. I've come to really enjoy the fight perhaps, because it feels so great to be constantly winning.

perhaps I am a bit to "science" oriented with my approach to deliberate creation and need to begin to allow things. above I almost said, "I'm addicted to the contrast" -- but I don't believe that I'm addicted to seeing the great difference between us anymore... I really think I'm addicted to the conflict and the resistance it provides to make my life exciting, more than the contrast.

I've begun to program more effectively lately, but again it's with the help of coffee, and I really like the creativity involved in it too. last night, when I was out watching stars, I wanted to program so badly that I went home early to program and drink coffee. I got some stuff done, but not a lot; by the time I got home I had nearly completely lost the strong desire I had to program. because I can't feel the desire consistiently, I tend to default to going out and sirring up a bunch of conflict to get feeling things again. it's more invigorating to feel like I'm winning a conflict (over control of my body), than it is to slog my way through the programming with little connection (feeling) to what I'm creating.

I don't believe that becoming a "cooperative component" will regain that feeling. I've tried that, sleeping lots and stuff, and I essentially sit around a zombie watching dota or youtube.

I feel like I'm sort of forced to continue on with the conflict for as long as it continues on. I don't have any real issue with getting into more of an "allowing" (cooperative) mode, but it doesn't make me feel good or productive.

help?

#### the answer that I felt

what I'm really looking for is the *path of least resistance* -- or the *path of most allowing*. I know what I don't want, so now I *should* be able to just pivot toward what I do want. I really felt like when there's no more resistance in me, then I'll actually see far more improvement than I am presently, so I guess I'll try being a bit more cooperative. it's kinda hard to put into words what I felt, but I think I got it.

«your inner being isn't in resistance. your inner being isn't pushing against the problem; your inner being is only giving undivided attention toward the solution. being in resistance is pushing against the solution. being in alignment with your inner being is being non-resistant (or less resistant)»

I think I'm going for full non-resistance now.

a little later on (41:00) you talked about how when resistance rises higher and higher, it summons stronger and stronger desire. when that happens, if you focus on te desire (what you want), your beliefs don't matter so much anymore... that's what I've been doing: I've gotten so good at amping up desire and then moving in the direction of them, that even though I still have some less-than-productive beliefs, I can still get the manifestation that I'm looking for (usually vision upgrades). so while I'm really good at releasing resistance and focusing in the direction of my desire, I *still* have some beliefs that aren't suiting me very well. I think that's what the thinking more in terms of "path of most allowance" now is kind of about -- instead of thinking in less-resistant ways to allow the desire.

I don't know if I explained myself very well, but there's a fine line between thinking less resitantly and thinking in more allowing: if my tuner is set to a lot of resistant things and I begin allowing more, I get a whole lot more unwanted stuff. however, if I'm generally not so resistant, and I begin allowing more, then I let in a lot more *wanted* stuff.

it's kinda funny what I'm saying because I'm saying that essentially I've gotten so good at feeling the reality of the desire (like the vision upgrade), that it manifests so quickly now -- yet my thoughts, beliefs, even though they provide my with sufficient resistance, it doesn't matter because I'm so good at feeling. now, I want to get good at thinking.

[1]: one of the interesing things is mr. motor roared his engine every time I had that idea, whic was a bit interesting to me too, because it seems to me maybe they "need" the fight?

### 2020-04-08 19:24

I have begun to try to meditate on a relatively daily basis now for no other reason than I really like my meditation spot. I stopped meditating for quite a while because it's become there's so much stuff going on when I do it, that I find it actually easier to "meditate" in daily life than it is to sit down and try to get connected to my source.

previously, I used to be able to quiet my mind quite easily, however lately I have noticed that I'm able to quiet my mind, but then another mind begins to start thinking. it really feels like I have 2-4 brains in my head thinking thoughts. I first observed the two minds thinking.. I would quiet one, then the other one would start to talk. I would focus in on quieting that one by observing it, and then either the first one would start again or a third one would begin.

previously, I would simply calm myself sufficiently to begin observing myself focused on something (like a star or my breathing), that I could easily get that good relaxed feeling.

it's hard to explain what I mean because I make it sound like there's these audible brains are competing, when it's more like the more I relax the presently one in focus, then I begin to hear another one that's speaking even softer. often times the stuff doesn't make much sense or it seems to be the exact thing that'll cause the most contrast for those listening in.

I can distinctly notice at least 2-4 different things happening. there perhaps may be more, but I've only been able to become aware of 4 of them max so far. man do they cause a whole lot of trouble and are impossible to get to quiet down. it feels like an out of control elementary school classroom in my head kinda.

I don't feel like it's a bad thing, and it doesn't feel like someting that's negative. in fact, quite the contrary, because it feels like I'm beginning to have 4 different trains (hehe) of thought at once. I've already noticed that I can pretty often have 2 trains of thought at once -- not like multi-tasking where it's like time slicing, but more like 2 people talking at once, and it feels too like I'm beginning to be able to become conscious of both of their words at the same time, too.

I'm kinda encouraging its growth, because I can only imagine how difficult it will be to keep track of my thoughts if two or more minds are thinking at once. it's causing havoc though because I'm having a lot of thoughts I normally wouldn't think start to pop out from time to time and it's becomming uncontrollable.

is there anything you can do to help me understand this?

#### where I'm headed with it presently...

because it feels like a bunch of schoolchildren all shouting things at once, it feels absolutely uncontrollable by me. during my meditation, the only way I can get any sort of cehesion is to focus them all in one direction. the focusing mechanism is totally rudimentary at the moment, but it seems to respond to feeling more than anything. if I can focus on how my heart feels or how some subject feels, I get feeling responses which are easy to work with, compared to the chaos of the "voices" or "thought" (cause I dunno if they make a sound to those listening in).

I dunno I'm just going to keep going with it and see what I discover with it.. feeling 4 things at once is easy compared to listening to 4 thoughts at once, so it feels like I want to try an keep it more heart/feeling focused than to let it go up to the throat or down to the imagination. I've been experimenting with how I can amplify it so it skips the emotions and imagination and goes all the way down to the "root" (dunnno how to describe this)... or, in the other direction, past the throat and the invisible sight and all the way up to the "crown" (again hard to explain what those are like).

I think I'm doing ok, so far,

### 2020-04-10 18:23 - jumbled brain & fighting against

I have had more indecision than normal lately. this morning, I couldn't figure out if I wanted to go to sleep or to go take a long walk and meditate. I wasn't terribly tired, so I decided I wanted to take a long walk and meditate on the hill. when I came back, I still didn't feel tired so I went to begin programming...

obviously someone doesn't like me programming (or something), because it also happens with youtube videos or even after playing hearthstone... they shut down my computer. I haven't really figured out a pattern to it, so there's no way I can try to cooperate at all with it. it just seems like the person turning off my computer just at seemingly random doesn't like things.

it's funny though, because, for example, I would have been programming a lot more last night, but because my computer was shut down, I went out and watched stars pretty successfully for the remainder of the night. before star watching, I wanted to smoke a cigarette. I did, and had a really great star-watching experience. when I woke up after losing conscionusness, I wanted to get a cigarette again and try one more time, because I was connecting so well with the star, yet at the same time the majority of my body, starting with my limbs was going numb like it happens when they rapidly drain energy from me when I'm unconscious (I have a future question about this and blood flow). I lost conscionusness again, but this time for a few hours. when I awoke I still wanted to smoke a cigarette and try again.

however the star I was doing so well with is now a few hours behind where it was and in the direction of the nighbour's driveway light, so I had to pick the blue one instead. I felt a strange reaction to me wanting to smoke a cigarette...

---

what I'm trying to say here is that it feels like a whole lot of my experience seems to be the result of others' pushing against, namely the guy shutting down my computer.

so, for example, you just got done talking about how our questions are participating greatly in the discussion, and all of a sudden I want to smoke. I was just outside drinking coffee before wanting to listen to this and I didn't feel any desire to smoke.. anyway, so I think the desire to smoke was a prompt to get me to start writing this:

my main question for today falls into the strangest of categories... this morning I felt compelled strongly to watch a video from bec hill. this isn't the first time that's happened, where I actively went back quite some time to search for a video I saw a long time ago -- but that's another story. anyway in the video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvnHAuE5FA) she is singing this really weird song, and she starts out by saying that the viewer should sing along. I don't want to sing along, I just want to listen to it and then decide if I want to participate. she says exactly that, and so I agree to keep watching. she starts singing, and instead of watching, I actually participate.

I thought that was really really weird... the weirdness continues though. the song is about ... lemme just write the lyrics:

```
egg
[egg]

egg toast
[egg toast]

egg toast jam
[egg toast jam]

mushrooms!
[mushrooms!]

cereal cereal cereal mushroom(s)
[cereal cereal cereal mushroom(s)]

no no no-no no mushroom
[no no no-no no mushroom]

ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yummy yummy
[ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yummy yummy]

ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yum!
[ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yum!]
```

so, some background on this.. I have been making coffee in the coffee maker here downstars and so consequently I have been accumulating coffee grounds in a bag. I keep getting the idea when I go star watching (and other times too), to put some of the mushroom spores I collected last year into the coffee grounds and try go grow mushrooms. I also have about a few grams of dried mushrooms still from then as well. one of the ideas I had in addition to growing them was to eat the dried one (assuming I'm unable to cultivate new ones) on my birthday this coming month.

a side note about my birthday: one day ben from suspicious observers posts in his morning news about this comet ATLAS, and it caught my attention that it would be crossing the ecliptic and would also conjoin venus and earth around may 28-29th. I made a comment and decided to just let things play out.

well, a few days later (maybe a week), (actually the morning of thih broadcast. 2020-04-09) @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrPDU4JpItU) I listened to the news again (sometimes I forget or whatever). I usually skip to around the 0:10 mark and get right to the news, usually cutting off a few seconds of his intro words, however this day I felt wanted to hear it, and I skipped back to hear what he said, and he said: "good morning folks, we're going to hit comet ATLAS again because apparently covering it twice already wasn't enough." anyway, when he said that, I had the impression that someone was giving him (or in some way influencing him) to make this news story.

he goes on in the news update to say that the "show is falling apart", and that fragmentation is taking place on the comet and that it won't be all that spectacular... also, weird.

a bit more of backstory on that one too, right after the first news broadcast @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwsmxx9wzOo) I was star-watching and I had this idea, that instead of trying to figure out all of this other details, the idea was to "go big or go home" and the idea I presented was to instead of trying to figure out all of this stuff, what if I just decided that I wanted to try and go for the most extremething possible, and (if things lined up), I presented the idea, what if we kicked it all off with henrietta on my birthday with the comet.

skipping all of the details why it seemed like a good idea, I eventually (and is my present position), that I don't really want to try and push things into place or make anything happen. instead, I just want to continue to star-watch as much as I can, and program this website I'm working on, and whenever I finally am stronger than they are (like last night when I was able to hold my focus on the star even with my body going numb), then my connection would be stronger than their ability to hold me back.

I have been experiencing more and more evidence that I'm gaining strength on them faster than they can remove it, and while it is possible that I could achive that level of strength by the time my birthday arrives, I'm not worried about it. I simply don't want to try and force things anymore. I prefer to let the feeling be enough and to let things progress naturally. also I have a habit of liking to be alone on my birthday anyway as take it as a refocusing time as I kind of gain the next download for the coming year (I also like to do a similar thing on new years).

---

so then, this morning when I'm listening to bec sing the song, the idea of "no no no no-no no mushroom" seemed to be having the opposite effect -- making me want to actually do the whole mushroom growing thing more.

I sincerely doubt that bec's video was a direct message to me, but it certainly had an effect. the most likely explanation for it is, she was feeling fun and wanted to make a video and thought mushrooms were funny, and the ittie bittie yummy part was just her having fun with it. instead, I blame a much bigger thing for this occurrance: the law of attraction.

it seems likely to me that someone has been pushing against my thoughts to grow mushrooms, and LOA put the idea/song that would directly impact me in the mind of a happy receptive (cooperative) person, which would then give me a message that would further intensify the figting against the mushroom idea. so yeah, it feels planned to me from a non-physical standpoint but I find it very unlikely that this was physically concocted to be a message to me. (it's really funny how LOA works, honestly).

also of interest, was that the last night and the previous one, the message that seemed to be providing me with the most relief from resistance as my body was numbing and vision blurring, that the more they fight against it, the worse they're making it for theirselves.

---

so, finally my question: I feel like this is all pushing against is somehow compelling me to want to try and grow the mushrooms. as for eating them on the day of my birthday, I'll wait until that arrives, but I'm kindof in the camp that I want to continue to increase in power (lower in resitance: that is, let more and more non-physical energy flow) and not worry about this whole birthday thing. it feels too much like trying too hard. the comet will come and go and *just the idea* of a sweet comet event on my birthday will be enough and it'll simply create more desire.

as a result, I'm just not worried about it. I can just continue to gain power without any manifestation for as long as is necessary. I totally have this down... another sidebar, last time I mentioned that above the throat was this invisible reality where anything can manifest as anything -- and I first began to explore it when they would remove my eyesight while they tried to figure out my new visual format after some vision upgrades... when they do that, I lose my ablity to see out of my eyes, yet because I'm accustomed to "seeing" my dreams and my imagination now without physically seeing anything, when my eyesight is removed, whatever thought I had been thinking immediately becomes a dream-like vision sequence (without visuals), and when I have realised that I'm in this non-visual space, it's the most incredible place ever. it feels absoltely amazing like warm and comfortable where there appears to be no pain or anything and thoughts manifest instantly in a non-visual reality. it's sooo cool!

that experience, combined with my super capability of feeling the desire and letting it become an instant manifestation of emotion (not physical or visual) has completely made me trust in the non-visual/physical. I simply do not need the manifestation anymore. I have such incredible confidence in this non-visual world, that I really want to be able to have control over my eyesight, because I would willingly remove it to gain access to this place again. actually, now that I think about it, when I first started to stare into the sun, I was quite literally blind in the centre of my vision and I began to experience this place then. when I became comfortable with the idea that I needed to (percievably) lose my vision in order to gain it, my visual capacity really started to expand tremendously. so much more I could say about this non-pysical place, but back to the subject at hand...

I have felt like my resolution to just not need the manifestation has created some impatience amongst some, wanting me find a way to make a quantum leap, insead of letting this drag on for seemlingly forever. what do I do about all of this? do I just accept the growing (desire) impatience and the pushing against as the motive force toward what's wanted?

---

another sidebar: I felt compelled to watch a video this morning about the historical moses being hatshepsut's advisor. @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O47_e7DC_Jo) in the video he says that his research was simultaneously corroborated by another guy's at roughly the same time, which reminded me of last broadcast when you said that ideas and invientions often times appear in the minds of multiple people at around the same time (calculus comes to mind), and so that game me further confidence in the theory this video presents. seems moses appeared at the moment of great pushing against by the pharoah of the semite people, and moses grew up in a suddenly monotheistic egypt and carried that idea out to become the next major worldview, in the process, invoking venus (sekmet), her capture in our system...

it seems like to me like there's this constant passing of the baton between thoth (mercury) and sekmet (venus) to put into place the next worldview. I remember watching the video and kept thinking that hatshepsut is a babe (she looks totally different than other egyptian women (like nefertiti) with much finer facial features). her and moses would have used the impatience of the semite slaves, combined with the pushing against of the pharoah at the time (tutmos I, which (ironically) means "thoth is born") to put into place the new world view of venus/sekmet.

so many sidebars... I know, it's just hard to express (and I did a very poor job), the incredible expansion of my consciousness and perceived to be very bizarre and other-worldly (non-physical) influence on my experience... energy is rising really really *REALLY* fast.

whew...

### thoughts on meditation (09:49)

as they were talking about meditation, I had a visual that -- because it seems to me clear what they're talking about -- I wanted to share.

when you're awake, you have thoughts, and some of those thoughts are more aligned to your source than others (those are the ones that feel good). the ones that are not present a sort of mental chaos which inhibits your cells and other portions of your body from receiving nen-physical replenishment. your body is, in a sense, tuned to your thoughts while you're awake. when you're asleep, you're not thinking (I usually do not think while I'm asleep, and I just "react" to vibrations put in my mind, which is why when I begin thinking to try and explain a question someone is asking me while I'm asleep, they inhibit my thought so that I don't become conscious).

actually, if you've ever experienced lucid dreaming, you can think and notice things in your dream (you're conscious), but if you think thoughts which contradict the vibration of the dream (or vision), then the vision will dissappear, and vanish almost immediately as you're no longer in the same frequency of the dream -- cause you just tuned to the thought, not the dream. so, it's better to just feel the dream and let it be how it is, instaed of trying too much to figure it out or observe (in the active sense) what is happening.

sleep doesn't improve your vibration, in the sense that it does not cause you to think different (less resistant thoughts) -- it just gives your body a break from them and allows you to replenish and heal. similarly, when meditating, you can slow thought down and stop thinking those thoughts which don't feel so good, but if, right after meditating you go right back to those thoughts, you will immediately feel the discord in those thoughts (cause you feel so much better), giving you an opprtunity to notice and potentially change that thought. meditation isn't a magic bullet, just like sleep isn't a magic bullet either. meditation just gives you a greater opportunity to change your perception to a way which feels better (by increasing the discord felt from having felt better for a short period of time).

---

oh, so the picture was, you can think of each thought as a note you're playing on a piano with the sustain pedal down... after you get enough of them going which are out of the key, then it starts to sound pretty bad. when you sleep, it's like letting off the sustain pedal for a bit, but if you wake back up and go back to playing those discordant notes, you will feel like you were before you slept. meditation makes it possible for you to consciously let up on the sustain pedal for a bit and hear the beautiful notes your source is playing (which are ususlly drowned out by your pounding the notes most important to you). in time you gain the ability to play notes more in the same key as your source, rather than the reactionary ones played in response to what you're observing.

### thopughts on putting thoughts into people's minds (11:09)

this happens to me all the time with nosebook. they like to try and put all sorts of thoughts into my head. I was very concerned about this at first, but then I realised that I was only capable of *receiving* the thoughts I was resonant with. if they transmitted a thought into my mind that I was not resonant with, it simply had no effect. just like IR or UV spectrum is all aronud you, but you don't see them, because your eyes are not on that wavelength. insects though can see them just fine. another way to look at it may be colour blinededness. if anger is red and you're colour blind to the colour red, then you simply will not see it. it'll appear as perhaps brown or green. it's like that: so having their attempts to try and "control" me by putting thoughts into my head has put me into a place of really cleaning up my vibration and only being resonant with the stuff I wanted to be resonant with. I now am getting really practised at only seeing the colours (or thinking the wavelengths) that I want to see (or think).

so, for example, this can be a good thing too, because my inner being may think it's beneficial to me to go to sleep or to take a nap, and I'm doing something else, so nosebook has the idea they want me to sleep, and so the thought appears in my head in a much stronger way (your inner being is a much softer voice than nosebook's projected thoughts, and always proportional to the desire which inspired their thought's appearance in your mind). so often times my inner being will use nosebook to send me a thought which I would otherwise be incapable of perceiving. if I have no resistance to sleeping, then it appears to them like they're "controlling" me, which is what they want, and to me I get a beneficial thought that I was in resonance with.

however, there is a caveat, which is that it's never satisfying to do something that someone else is telling (or motivating) you to do. I was really bothered by this, and a lot of the releasing of resistance I was talking about last time was about this very thing.. it's allowing the thought come from my own inspiration even if someone else is asking, demanding, or even trying to force me to do something. the right way, I have noticed is to not makke the action because someone else is requiring it from me, but to line up with what I'm going to do, and make the action because it's something I want to do for the greater feeling of well-being (and just completely ignore their motivation on the subject).
