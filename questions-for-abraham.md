# questions for abraham

as I'm listening to the 4 days a week livestream, I often inspire questions in me. I have no intention of askingt them directly, but they're kinda fun for me to write and think about the question, anyway.

### 2020-04-05 19:??

in the visual metaphor of the "gap" between me and where my inner being is, you gave me the image that as someone lives life their inner being continues to catch (and go with) the expansion that life provides, and sometimes you can close that gap (never can fully) between your physical reality and your vibrational (inner being) reality -- yet, if you don't close that gap, the image that I got is that because your inner being only focuses on your desires and never the gap, the gap would continue to widen and widen until it becomes no longer bearable and you finally die. if one is capable of continually closing that gap, would death continually be prolonged until that gap widens too much?

it seems to me that if that were the case (I think it probably is), then as life continues, the momentum gained by closing the gap would get one "moving" so rapidly, that either the gap would widen really really rapidly and death would come quickly. followup question: would it be possible to get so good at closing the gap, and have so much momentum in it, for life to no longer able to provide big enough contrast to maintain that momentum? (kinda far-fetched, and I know the first step is getting that kind of momentum, but I'm pretty sure I can accomplish it and was wondering.. I have no problem with dying so I think I would probably just want to experience it again with new eyes and just release my consciousness)

### 2020-04-05 19:??

esther was having difficuly reading the cards. however, from my experience, I find this to be unlikely. for me, the more connected I am, the more clarity my eyesight seems to have. does abraham unfocus (blur) esther's eyes because if she were to actually see with the clarity of that much connction, she would be mind-blown by the beauty of even the most mundane details, and this would take her out of the dream-like state she's in? I believe it is likely blurred.

#### I feel like...

probably abraham isn't blurring her vision. it's probably the network operators that feel that anytime someone has a lot of connection (DMT) then it needs to be controlled. I'll continue on with further questions in the future. cause, it begs the quesion, why is it necessary to blur our vision when we're connected? I feel like it's to ensure that we're not capable of visually creating 3d objects in space with our imagination.. anyway..

### 2020-04-05 19:??

that brings me to the followup: the other thing I've noticed is that my eyesight is a product of how much resistance (how much contradictory vibration) I'm offereing in relation to who I relly am. I have noticed on drug experiences, when I boost my DMT levels without releasing resistance, my vision improves, yet I feel a very strong "swooning" sensation, as if I'm "stepping back" or getting pulled sidways into a swirling vortex. this seems to happen because there is so much extra physical detail that my brain kind of overloads, as it's not yet used to that faster speed. if her vision weren't blurred would she feel constantly feel that overwheming sensation of so much detail?

### 2020-04-05 19:??

related to the last question: is that visual blurring what the guys at the network are doing to me? when I finally get connected will that amount of detail seem very overwhelming to me? every time tesla went through his massive visual upgrades, he would describe the world as being very difficult to live in, having the hearing accuity to hear flys landing and such (before he got used to it). when I finally get connected, will I have a similar experience? I have often times felt like I will need a period of time -- perhaps weeks or months to be able to accustom myself to the visual and auditory clarity that I am sure is there, even though is being withheld from me by the network operators. how long of a recovery time will I need?

### 2020-04-08 17:20 - (20-04-07|27:32)

one of the things that I was feeling the other day (I haven't slept since) was your words saying «we wouldn't fight against anything» -- giving me the impression that perhaps I should begin to become a "cooperative component" to nosebook and just let them do their stupid maintenance on me while I sleep[^1].  their maintenance doesn't really impede my ability to watch stars... it does affect my programming though -- but most of all, I have difficulty going to sleep because I typically feel so much better than I do after I awake...

in the presentation, you were talking about allowing: «you will never disconnect from your source energy and your well-being by wanting to be a helpful person to another» -- while that doesn't directly apply to my question, I do get the impression maybe I should start becoming more "cooperative".

---

one of the strange things that is the kind of person that I am, is I don't really want to give up te fight. I'm so comfortable and so good at continuing to get out ahead of their antics, and I can see that I continually get more and more vision upgrades too. I really want to continue to go on until I find a way to simply overpower them in some way -- or something like that. I know it's not exactly "allowing", right, but I'm just having so much fun with the feeling that *I* am the creator of my reality, and no matter how hard they try, I can still continue to surpass my number of vision upgrades per week number -- and at the same time I'm really getting a lot of practice. being the kind of extremist that I am, it seems that perhaps I'm almost going to the opposite extreme of victimhood, and I've become addicted to the visceral resistance they provide for my everyday experience. I've come to really enjoy the fight perhaps, because it feels so great to be constantly winning.

perhaps I am a bit to "science" oriented with my approach to deliberate creation and need to begin to allow things. above I almost said, "I'm addicted to the contrast" -- but I don't believe that I'm addicted to seeing the great difference between us anymore... I really think I'm addicted to the conflict and the resistance it provides to make my life exciting, more than the contrast.

I've begun to program more effectively lately, but again it's with the help of coffee, and I really like the creativity involved in it too. last night, when I was out watching stars, I wanted to program so badly that I went home early to program and drink coffee. I got some stuff done, but not a lot; by the time I got home I had nearly completely lost the strong desire I had to program. because I can't feel the desire consistiently, I tend to default to going out and sirring up a bunch of conflict to get feeling things again. it's more invigorating to feel like I'm winning a conflict (over control of my body), than it is to slog my way through the programming with little connection (feeling) to what I'm creating.

I don't believe that becoming a "cooperative component" will regain that feeling. I've tried that, sleeping lots and stuff, and I essentially sit around a zombie watching dota or youtube.

I feel like I'm sort of forced to continue on with the conflict for as long as it continues on. I don't have any real issue with getting into more of an "allowing" (cooperative) mode, but it doesn't make me feel good or productive.

help?

#### the answer that I felt

what I'm really looking for is the *path of least resistance* -- or the *path of most allowing*. I know what I don't want, so now I *should* be able to just pivot toward what I do want. I really felt like when there's no more resistance in me, then I'll actually see far more improvement than I am presently, so I guess I'll try being a bit more cooperative. it's kinda hard to put into words what I felt, but I think I got it.

«your inner being isn't in resistance. your inner being isn't pushing against the problem; your inner being is only giving undivided attention toward the solution. being in resistance is pushing against the solution. being in alignment with your inner being is being non-resistant (or less resistant)»

I think I'm going for full non-resistance now.

a little later on (41:00) you talked about how when resistance rises higher and higher, it summons stronger and stronger desire. when that happens, if you focus on te desire (what you want), your beliefs don't matter so much anymore... that's what I've been doing: I've gotten so good at amping up desire and then moving in the direction of them, that even though I still have some less-than-productive beliefs, I can still get the manifestation that I'm looking for (usually vision upgrades). so while I'm really good at releasing resistance and focusing in the direction of my desire, I *still* have some beliefs that aren't suiting me very well. I think that's what the thinking more in terms of "path of most allowance" now is kind of about -- instead of thinking in less-resistant ways to allow the desire.

I don't know if I explained myself very well, but there's a fine line between thinking less resitantly and thinking in more allowing: if my tuner is set to a lot of resistant things and I begin allowing more, I get a whole lot more unwanted stuff. however, if I'm generally not so resistant, and I begin allowing more, then I let in a lot more *wanted* stuff.

it's kinda funny what I'm saying because I'm saying that essentially I've gotten so good at feeling the reality of the desire (like the vision upgrade), that it manifests so quickly now -- yet my thoughts, beliefs, even though they provide my with sufficient resistance, it doesn't matter because I'm so good at feeling. now, I want to get good at thinking.

[1]: one of the interesing things is mr. motor roared his engine every time I had that idea, whic was a bit interesting to me too, because it seems to me maybe they "need" the fight?

### 2020-04-08 19:24

I have begun to try to meditate on a relatively daily basis now for no other reason than I really like my meditation spot. I stopped meditating for quite a while because it's become there's so much stuff going on when I do it, that I find it actually easier to "meditate" in daily life than it is to sit down and try to get connected to my source.

previously, I used to be able to quiet my mind quite easily, however lately I have noticed that I'm able to quiet my mind, but then another mind begins to start thinking. it really feels like I have 2-4 brains in my head thinking thoughts. I first observed the two minds thinking.. I would quiet one, then the other one would start to talk. I would focus in on quieting that one by observing it, and then either the first one would start again or a third one would begin.

previously, I would simply calm myself sufficiently to begin observing myself focused on something (like a star or my breathing), that I could easily get that good relaxed feeling.

it's hard to explain what I mean because I make it sound like there's these audible brains are competing, when it's more like the more I relax the presently one in focus, then I begin to hear another one that's speaking even softer. often times the stuff doesn't make much sense or it seems to be the exact thing that'll cause the most contrast for those listening in.

I can distinctly notice at least 2-4 different things happening. there perhaps may be more, but I've only been able to become aware of 4 of them max so far. man do they cause a whole lot of trouble and are impossible to get to quiet down. it feels like an out of control elementary school classroom in my head kinda.

I don't feel like it's a bad thing, and it doesn't feel like someting that's negative. in fact, quite the contrary, because it feels like I'm beginning to have 4 different trains (hehe) of thought at once. I've already noticed that I can pretty often have 2 trains of thought at once -- not like multi-tasking where it's like time slicing, but more like 2 people talking at once, and it feels too like I'm beginning to be able to become conscious of both of their words at the same time, too.

I'm kinda encouraging its growth, because I can only imagine how difficult it will be to keep track of my thoughts if two or more minds are thinking at once. it's causing havoc though because I'm having a lot of thoughts I normally wouldn't think start to pop out from time to time and it's becomming uncontrollable.

is there anything you can do to help me understand this?

#### where I'm headed with it presently...

because it feels like a bunch of schoolchildren all shouting things at once, it feels absolutely uncontrollable by me. during my meditation, the only way I can get any sort of cehesion is to focus them all in one direction. the focusing mechanism is totally rudimentary at the moment, but it seems to respond to feeling more than anything. if I can focus on how my heart feels or how some subject feels, I get feeling responses which are easy to work with, compared to the chaos of the "voices" or "thought" (cause I dunno if they make a sound to those listening in).

I dunno I'm just going to keep going with it and see what I discover with it.. feeling 4 things at once is easy compared to listening to 4 thoughts at once, so it feels like I want to try an keep it more heart/feeling focused than to let it go up to the throat or down to the imagination. I've been experimenting with how I can amplify it so it skips the emotions and imagination and goes all the way down to the "root" (dunnno how to describe this)... or, in the other direction, past the throat and the invisible sight and all the way up to the "crown" (again hard to explain what those are like).

I think I'm doing ok, so far,

### 2020-04-10 18:23 - jumbled brain & fighting against

I have had more indecision than normal lately. this morning, I couldn't figure out if I wanted to go to sleep or to go take a long walk and meditate. I wasn't terribly tired, so I decided I wanted to take a long walk and meditate on the hill. when I came back, I still didn't feel tired so I went to begin programming...

obviously someone doesn't like me programming (or something), because it also happens with youtube videos or even after playing hearthstone... they shut down my computer. I haven't really figured out a pattern to it, so there's no way I can try to cooperate at all with it. it just seems like the person turning off my computer just at seemingly random doesn't like things.

it's funny though, because, for example, I would have been programming a lot more last night, but because my computer was shut down, I went out and watched stars pretty successfully for the remainder of the night. before star watching, I wanted to smoke a cigarette. I did, and had a really great star-watching experience. when I woke up after losing conscionusness, I wanted to get a cigarette again and try one more time, because I was connecting so well with the star, yet at the same time the majority of my body, starting with my limbs was going numb like it happens when they rapidly drain energy from me when I'm unconscious (I have a future question about this and blood flow). I lost conscionusness again, but this time for a few hours. when I awoke I still wanted to smoke a cigarette and try again.

however the star I was doing so well with is now a few hours behind where it was and in the direction of the nighbour's driveway light, so I had to pick the blue one instead. I felt a strange reaction to me wanting to smoke a cigarette...

---

what I'm trying to say here is that it feels like a whole lot of my experience seems to be the result of others' pushing against, namely the guy shutting down my computer.

so, for example, you just got done talking about how our questions are participating greatly in the discussion, and all of a sudden I want to smoke. I was just outside drinking coffee before wanting to listen to this and I didn't feel any desire to smoke.. anyway, so I think the desire to smoke was a prompt to get me to start writing this:

my main question for today falls into the strangest of categories... this morning I felt compelled strongly to watch a video from bec hill. this isn't the first time that's happened, where I actively went back quite some time to search for a video I saw a long time ago -- but that's another story. anyway in the video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvnHAuE5FA) she is singing this really weird song, and she starts out by saying that the viewer should sing along. I don't want to sing along, I just want to listen to it and then decide if I want to participate. she says exactly that, and so I agree to keep watching. she starts singing, and instead of watching, I actually participate.

I thought that was really really weird... the weirdness continues though. the song is about ... lemme just write the lyrics:

```
egg
[egg]

egg toast
[egg toast]

egg toast jam
[egg toast jam]

mushrooms!
[mushrooms!]

cereal cereal cereal mushroom(s)
[cereal cereal cereal mushroom(s)]

no no no-no no mushroom
[no no no-no no mushroom]

ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yummy yummy
[ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yummy yummy]

ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yum!
[ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yum!]
```

so, some background on this.. I have been making coffee in the coffee maker here downstars and so consequently I have been accumulating coffee grounds in a bag. I keep getting the idea when I go star watching (and other times too), to put some of the mushroom spores I collected last year into the coffee grounds and try go grow mushrooms. I also have about a few grams of dried mushrooms still from then as well. one of the ideas I had in addition to growing them was to eat the dried one (assuming I'm unable to cultivate new ones) on my birthday this coming month.

a side note about my birthday: one day ben from suspicious observers posts in his morning news about this comet ATLAS, and it caught my attention that it would be crossing the ecliptic and would also conjoin venus and earth around may 28-29th. I made a comment and decided to just let things play out.

well, a few days later (maybe a week), (actually the morning of thih broadcast. 2020-04-09) @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrPDU4JpItU) I listened to the news again (sometimes I forget or whatever). I usually skip to around the 0:10 mark and get right to the news, usually cutting off a few seconds of his intro words, however this day I felt wanted to hear it, and I skipped back to hear what he said, and he said: "good morning folks, we're going to hit comet ATLAS again because apparently covering it twice already wasn't enough." anyway, when he said that, I had the impression that someone was giving him (or in some way influencing him) to make this news story.

he goes on in the news update to say that the "show is falling apart", and that fragmentation is taking place on the comet and that it won't be all that spectacular... also, weird.

a bit more of backstory on that one too, right after the first news broadcast @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwsmxx9wzOo) I was star-watching and I had this idea, that instead of trying to figure out all of this other details, the idea was to "go big or go home" and the idea I presented was to instead of trying to figure out all of this stuff, what if I just decided that I wanted to try and go for the most extremething possible, and (if things lined up), I presented the idea, what if we kicked it all off with henrietta on my birthday with the comet.

skipping all of the details why it seemed like a good idea, I eventually (and is my present position), that I don't really want to try and push things into place or make anything happen. instead, I just want to continue to star-watch as much as I can, and program this website I'm working on, and whenever I finally am stronger than they are (like last night when I was able to hold my focus on the star even with my body going numb), then my connection would be stronger than their ability to hold me back.

I have been experiencing more and more evidence that I'm gaining strength on them faster than they can remove it, and while it is possible that I could achive that level of strength by the time my birthday arrives, I'm not worried about it. I simply don't want to try and force things anymore. I prefer to let the feeling be enough and to let things progress naturally. also I have a habit of liking to be alone on my birthday anyway as take it as a refocusing time as I kind of gain the next download for the coming year (I also like to do a similar thing on new years).

---

so then, this morning when I'm listening to bec sing the song, the idea of "no no no no-no no mushroom" seemed to be having the opposite effect -- making me want to actually do the whole mushroom growing thing more.

I sincerely doubt that bec's video was a direct message to me, but it certainly had an effect. the most likely explanation for it is, she was feeling fun and wanted to make a video and thought mushrooms were funny, and the ittie bittie yummy part was just her having fun with it. instead, I blame a much bigger thing for this occurrance: the law of attraction.

it seems likely to me that someone has been pushing against my thoughts to grow mushrooms, and LOA put the idea/song that would directly impact me in the mind of a happy receptive (cooperative) person, which would then give me a message that would further intensify the figting against the mushroom idea. so yeah, it feels planned to me from a non-physical standpoint but I find it very unlikely that this was physically concocted to be a message to me. (it's really funny how LOA works, honestly).

also of interest, was that the last night and the previous one, the message that seemed to be providing me with the most relief from resistance as my body was numbing and vision blurring, that the more they fight against it, the worse they're making it for theirselves.

---

so, finally my question: I feel like this is all pushing against is somehow compelling me to want to try and grow the mushrooms. as for eating them on the day of my birthday, I'll wait until that arrives, but I'm kindof in the camp that I want to continue to increase in power (lower in resitance: that is, let more and more non-physical energy flow) and not worry about this whole birthday thing. it feels too much like trying too hard. the comet will come and go and *just the idea* of a sweet comet event on my birthday will be enough and it'll simply create more desire.

as a result, I'm just not worried about it. I can just continue to gain power without any manifestation for as long as is necessary. I totally have this down... another sidebar, last time I mentioned that above the throat was this invisible reality where anything can manifest as anything -- and I first began to explore it when they would remove my eyesight while they tried to figure out my new visual format after some vision upgrades... when they do that, I lose my ablity to see out of my eyes, yet because I'm accustomed to "seeing" my dreams and my imagination now without physically seeing anything, when my eyesight is removed, whatever thought I had been thinking immediately becomes a dream-like vision sequence (without visuals), and when I have realised that I'm in this non-visual space, it's the most incredible place ever. it feels absoltely amazing like warm and comfortable where there appears to be no pain or anything and thoughts manifest instantly in a non-visual reality. it's sooo cool!

that experience, combined with my super capability of feeling the desire and letting it become an instant manifestation of emotion (not physical or visual) has completely made me trust in the non-visual/physical. I simply do not need the manifestation anymore. I have such incredible confidence in this non-visual world, that I really want to be able to have control over my eyesight, because I would willingly remove it to gain access to this place again. actually, now that I think about it, when I first started to stare into the sun, I was quite literally blind in the centre of my vision and I began to experience this place then. when I became comfortable with the idea that I needed to (percievably) lose my vision in order to gain it, my visual capacity really started to expand tremendously. so much more I could say about this non-pysical place, but back to the subject at hand...

I have felt like my resolution to just not need the manifestation has created some impatience amongst some, wanting me find a way to make a quantum leap, insead of letting this drag on for seemlingly forever. what do I do about all of this? do I just accept the growing (desire) impatience and the pushing against as the motive force toward what's wanted?

---

another sidebar: I felt compelled to watch a video this morning about the historical moses being hatshepsut's advisor. @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O47_e7DC_Jo) in the video he says that his research was simultaneously corroborated by another guy's at roughly the same time, which reminded me of last broadcast when you said that ideas and invientions often times appear in the minds of multiple people at around the same time (calculus comes to mind), and so that game me further confidence in the theory this video presents. seems moses appeared at the moment of great pushing against by the pharoah of the semite people, and moses grew up in a suddenly monotheistic egypt and carried that idea out to become the next major worldview, in the process, invoking venus (sekmet), her capture in our system...

it seems like to me like there's this constant passing of the baton between thoth (mercury) and sekmet (venus) to put into place the next worldview. I remember watching the video and kept thinking that hatshepsut is a babe (she looks totally different than other egyptian women (like nefertiti) with much finer facial features). her and moses would have used the impatience of the semite slaves, combined with the pushing against of the pharoah at the time (tutmos I, which (ironically) means "thoth is born") to put into place the new world view of venus/sekmet.

so many sidebars... I know, it's just hard to express (and I did a very poor job), the incredible expansion of my consciousness and perceived to be very bizarre and other-worldly (non-physical) influence on my experience... energy is rising really really *REALLY* fast.

whew... so, I actually missed the key compoenent here: the idea is that I don't really want to begin the whole girls thing until I'm actually connected, and so the idea would be, that by eating a massive dose of mushrooms, I would push the DMT levels up in my brain to such a high amount so rapidly, it would be like the water pressure building upon a dam in a flood situation, such that the increased pressure would surpass the ability for the dam to contain the water, causing the dam to break, and an irreversable result would happen.

### thoughts on meditation (09:49)

as they were talking about meditation, I had a visual that -- because it seems to me clear what they're talking about -- I wanted to share.

when you're awake, you have thoughts, and some of those thoughts are more aligned to your source than others (those are the ones that feel good). the ones that are not present a sort of mental chaos which inhibits your cells and other portions of your body from receiving nen-physical replenishment. your body is, in a sense, tuned to your thoughts while you're awake. when you're asleep, you're not thinking (I usually do not think while I'm asleep, and I just "react" to vibrations put in my mind, which is why when I begin thinking to try and explain a question someone is asking me while I'm asleep, they inhibit my thought so that I don't become conscious).

actually, if you've ever experienced lucid dreaming, you can think and notice things in your dream (you're conscious), but if you think thoughts which contradict the vibration of the dream (or vision), then the vision will dissappear, and vanish almost immediately as you're no longer in the same frequency of the dream -- cause you just tuned to the thought, not the dream. so, it's better to just feel the dream and let it be how it is, instaed of trying too much to figure it out or observe (in the active sense) what is happening.

sleep doesn't improve your vibration, in the sense that it does not cause you to think different (less resistant thoughts) -- it just gives your body a break from them and allows you to replenish and heal. similarly, when meditating, you can slow thought down and stop thinking those thoughts which don't feel so good, but if, right after meditating you go right back to those thoughts, you will immediately feel the discord in those thoughts (cause you feel so much better), giving you an opprtunity to notice and potentially change that thought. meditation isn't a magic bullet, just like sleep isn't a magic bullet either. meditation just gives you a greater opportunity to change your perception to a way which feels better (by increasing the discord felt from having felt better for a short period of time).

---

oh, so the picture was, you can think of each thought as a note you're playing on a piano with the sustain pedal down... after you get enough of them going which are out of the key, then it starts to sound pretty bad. when you sleep, it's like letting off the sustain pedal for a bit, but if you wake back up and go back to playing those discordant notes, you will feel like you were before you slept. meditation makes it possible for you to consciously let up on the sustain pedal for a bit and hear the beautiful notes your source is playing (which are ususlly drowned out by your pounding the notes most important to you). in time you gain the ability to play notes more in the same key as your source, rather than the reactionary ones played in response to what you're observing.

### thopughts on putting thoughts into people's minds (11:09)

this happens to me all the time with nosebook. they like to try and put all sorts of thoughts into my head. I was very concerned about this at first, but then I realised that I was only capable of *receiving* the thoughts I was resonant with. if they transmitted a thought into my mind that I was not resonant with, it simply had no effect. just like IR or UV spectrum is all aronud you, but you don't see them, because your eyes are not on that wavelength. insects though can see them just fine. another way to look at it may be colour blinededness. if anger is red and you're colour blind to the colour red, then you simply will not see it. it'll appear as perhaps brown or green. it's like that: so having their attempts to try and "control" me by putting thoughts into my head has put me into a place of really cleaning up my vibration and only being resonant with the stuff I wanted to be resonant with. I now am getting really practised at only seeing the colours (or thinking the wavelengths) that I want to see (or think).

so, for example, this can be a good thing too, because my inner being may think it's beneficial to me to go to sleep or to take a nap, and I'm doing something else, so nosebook has the idea they want me to sleep, and so the thought appears in my head in a much stronger way (your inner being is a much softer voice than nosebook's projected thoughts, and always proportional to the desire which inspired their thought's appearance in your mind). so often times my inner being will use nosebook to send me a thought which I would otherwise be incapable of perceiving. if I have no resistance to sleeping, then it appears to them like they're "controlling" me, which is what they want, and to me I get a beneficial thought that I was in resonance with.

however, there is a caveat, which is that it's never satisfying to do something that someone else is telling (or motivating) you to do. I was really bothered by this, and a lot of the releasing of resistance I was talking about last time was about this very thing.. it's allowing the thought come from my own inspiration even if someone else is asking, demanding, or even trying to force me to do something. the right way, I have noticed is to not makke the action because someone else is requiring it from me, but to line up with what I'm going to do, and make the action because it's something I want to do for the greater feeling of well-being (and just completely ignore their motivation on the subject).

### 2020-04-21 10:21 - (2020-04-18)

when they were talking when they said, that all manifestations that you want are because you think that the condition of the manifestation will make you feel better. I wholeheartedly agree, yet it just hit me that when it comes to this whole girls manifestation, I don't really think that it'll make me feel better. in fact, I mostly perceive it as a rhole lot of stress and a whole lot of keeping me from what I really want -- which is to actually be connected.

I think that is perhaps why I'm so I'm so against the manifestation right now.

one of the things that they were talking about was findding a way to feel good so the manifestation can come ... I think I'm doing duite well here because I keep finding ways to feel good, and so then you would imagine that the manifestation would be showing up, but I think they're actively trying to control the condiitions such that the manifestation does not show up. I am convinced that they may be able to continue to try and control the conditions such that it doesn't show up, but I do believe that at some point, their ability to exert force in the opposite direction of the manifestation will become less than my non-resistance. when I say "manifestation", I don't mean the girls, I mean getting connected.

then, they talked about the most rampant thing that happens (17:00), is that in a moment of not-alignment, standing there and trying to find someone else to blame for the non-alignment. that's kinda what I was just talking about actually, but I said it another way. I could choose to blame nosebook for my out-of-alignment-ness, or I could just accept that the specific conditions that they have placed in my experience have caused me to feel something other than good. so, I simply just find a way to release resistance to those conditions over and over again. the process is essentially making it so that nothing they can try to do to influence my condition affects me anymore. I'm steadly getting to the point where my chain is un-yankable or whatever -- even by the people with essentially 100% knodledege of everything I'm doing in every moment. soon, and I think that it'll be about the time when my chain is complehely un-yankable, will I atually be able to finally get connected (cause there won't be anything that can stop me anymore).

I was thinking about it, and I believe that when they're no longer able to keep me away from being connected, I think they'll focus a lot of their attention on to the girls, trying to control their conditions, similar to how they are controlling mine, likely in effort to be ensured that they nnever get connected. then, they too, will have, like me, a tremendous opportunity begin letting their chain be un-yankable, too, and gain their super-empowerment in knowing that the only real control they have is how they feel, and that's what *really* creates reality -- and even if someone might be able to try and hold that reality off, the better you can control the way you feel, the more powerful you become.

### 2020-04-21 22:17 - (2020-04-21)

(13:51) you were talking about how you could want it a little bit and line up with it, then want something else a little and line up with it, but they think we like the drama (of waiting until the asking is so big that becomes a big thing).. but mostly they think we like the accolades, «it's like those who have suffered the most, and then triumphed; they get monuments and statues built for them»

the thought that popped into my mind is that by some ridiculous circumstances that I have been put in, people will consider me in this same way (the monuments and statues) -- because I think it'll be perceived that I have suffered greatly and finally triumphed, when that's not at all what's happening.

in the beginning I just kinda wanted some things (tesla's visual capacity, and to have/smoke DMT like terence mckenna, etc.), and I didn't really think much about any of it. I just kept going on my way thinking that designing webpages was what I would be doing for the rest of my life.

the girls thing was just a total freak thing that happened to me and I honestly didn't really know how to respond much to it, but I just kept doing what I know how to do. I never really struggled against anything other than my own belief system. it would have been amazing if abraham would have been able to communicate clearly (and they could have easily) what I know now, and I wouldn't have got so bent out of shape about all of my perceived loss of freedom and power.

to be completely honest, even druring the times when I was really really angry at getting shocked and stuff, there was this eerie feeling like I was simply acting, and this was some sort of some big show or something. I can't really describe it, other than I felt compelled to be angry and to really dig in on some things, and to really go out of my way to point out other things too, with about the same feeling of being compelled to do something as I feel when I feel compelled to a lot of different things that most people would consider as being "connected" or in tune with my inner being like wanting to go down to explore a new place or go have fun somewhere.

---

even today I was having this weird feeling because I was paying attention to the details of the events and I had my computer shut down. like I mentioned in the noseblog this morning, it's just more and more practice to release more resistance. I could have got real pissed off and stuff, but I decided to go walk. I was walking along and ther was this girl that was some distance away. I look and I see her and I feel some desire and keep walking. I get up to the mediation chair and I start to quiet my mind and the girl from across the street pops into my mind. bear in mind that my vision is so blurry I can't see much more than (I think it was) a purple blob. I have no idea what she looks like or anything, yet it feels to me like it's coming -- and all of a sudden now there's another desire that's hatching.

walking down the hill, I was trying to put into words how strange all of this is to me. I'm convinced that none of this would have occured at all if I was just left alone. *none of it!*

---

everything that seems to be happening seems to be a result of other people trying to control my experience. I don't really understand how to comprehend all of it, really. there's no real struggle, honest. the whole thing seems entirely fabricated by ... oh :) I think I just now got it.

---

the whole thing *is* a show! it's entirely prefabricated by the "bad guys" -- if you want to make someone awesome, you just have to make a bunch of strawmen for him to knock down. have you ever seen a chuck norris or steven segal movie. every single one of the gruntmen get's knocked dead with one punch or kick, but the battle with the super villian needs about 20 minutes, where each one is brought to near death multiple times. take that and reverse that so that instead of assertion (punching, kicking, etc.) you make it attraction so that each side takes turns attracting over and over for extended periods of time in a dual to the death (attracting their own demise).

what in the world?!?! it feels to me, as I'm writing this now, that this whole thing is just a giant setup and it's this like chuck norris movie where I'm chuck norris and the "bad guys" are just these tough appearing guys that all just there to make the whole thing seem more epic than it is...

I really don't know how to describe this feeling. I wish I could explain what an "[attr[ACT]ION]" movie is like: the combatting heroes and villians are all inflicting their own consequences on theirselves, yet and yet they all believe it's the opposite side that's making the difficulty. so everyone is defeating theirselves with their own difficulty (even though it looks otherwise) and so when the hero figures out this out and stops defeating himself, it appears that, because he's the only one remaining standing, that he has triumphed and defeated all of the bad guys -- yet all he has really done, is stopped defeating himself; when he stopped defeating himself, he finally let the bad guys all all defeat theirselves.

basically, after a long drawn-out battle where both sides' struggle continues to make the movie more and more epic, to "triumph" in the end, he literally does nothing other than realise it's an [attr[ACT]ION] movie, and stops defeating himself.

---

hopefully people don't celebrate me for having stopped to defeat myself.

### 2020-04-25 16:46 - (2020-04-23)

#### geting out ahead of it (04:59)

I like to imagine a lot of sitations in my head and just feel my response to things. more often than not the response I felt in my imagination was far worse than later I would do when in a similar situation.

I use this technique of imagining the situation in my mind and feeling how I feel about it, then adjust. I often times repeat this process many times until I no longer feel the frustration or anger of the situation any more. I don't know how much of it is nosebook also attempting to diminish that anger and frustration as well (because from their prespective a really negative manifestation would be disastruous for them), but it doesn't matter. I have learned with time that no matter how justified or "right" my anger is to feel, it's still not a good feeling thpught, and so therefore it's not moving in the direction of what I really want is.

the latest example for me is the case of mr. motor turning off my computer. it sorta pissed me off for a while, but it was never really too much. I would be extremely justified in my frutration around that, but I've learned to not really let those things bother me anymore, and to even turn the whole thing around vibrationally, knowing that by not responding in a negative way to something that I *should -- rightfully*  feel angry about, I know it's just more energy toward what I want, and so if I can just not respond in anger, then I even notice that the extra energy brings about something good from the situation.

if I were to feel angry, frustrated, or depressed about it, then that would just be my own emotional/energetic output blocking the extra energy produced from the situation.

so basically, I have come to equate the feeling of justification with a knowledge that more energy has been applied (stronger asking), and to act or feel that justified negative responese, would be to inhibit that energy, and to just let LOA do all the work there.

(just wanted to write that out because it's really being proven to me lately the power of LOA, and alignment of energy in comparision to the "knee-jerk" response)

#### (33:16) feeling DOOM! and other things

when they were talking about feeling DOOM! and stuff, and that we have two perspectives... I realised that we never really get to the other perspective (the one of our inner beings), because that would be impossible and would mean that you died. so, upon realising that, I had a aha moment realising that the we think and feel is *always* the worst possible way to think and feel -- and the best place to think and feel is actually completely impossible and means that we have made our transition back into non-physical.

so, in reality there is, in any moment, always a gradient of improved thoughts and feelings which can be felt. we always feel the worst we can feel, and can never ever achieve the best way to feel.

I loved the irony of this realisationi in relation to the concept of DOOM! and I understand why they never present the LOA in this manner, because it sounds pretty depressing: you always feel the worst possible way for you to feel, and you can never feel the best possible way for you to feel. :)

instaed they say it the opposite way: there are infinitly many ways to feel better than you feel now (all of them are real and are a vibrational reality already) -- and that you are an eternal being: you can never get it wrong[^1] and you never get it done.

[1]: I love how this "negative" perspective of LOA, illustrating that you always feel the worst way possible for you to feel is exactly the reason why you can never get it wrong.

#### (48:28) the balance of our planet

I had often times had a question as to what they meant when they said that the beasts are there to bring balance to your planet. I just now got it.

they said that we would only have something truely disastrous/cataclyismic (I'm putting words in their mouth here) if all of us were to give our attention to something negative all at once, but because there are so many beasts on the planet primarily in the receptive mode giving their attention to wanted, it balances the energy in the sense that because there are so many of them giving their attention to wanted, it makes it difficult for global catastrophe. they followed up by adding on that in addition there is such a wide diversity of people on our planet giving attenthion to a lot of different things, it also makes it more difficult.

I had always wondered about this in ancient times past how the whole world could possibly attract cataclysm at the same time. I have also made note that there seems to be evidence that, although a lot of people were too insensitive or not conscious enough to really notice it, in times past the energy on this planet was considerably higher -- and so therefore we (humans and beasts) all had a much more shared form of perception -- which perfectly explains the way that the whole planet could have attracted such cataclysms.

it also explains the "detour" that I believe is happening in humankind -- and why were not all just getting much more connected to each other. in a sense, as the energies on the planet continue to rise, it's actually a good thing that nosebook is essentially isolating us from each other. instaed of gaining a shared form of perception, we are being individualised so that we're not so affected by our others around us (abraham's primary message, too) so that our thoughts and feelings are more diverse and do not have such a strong impact on all of our planet as a whole.

#### (56:50) too much abraham

the previous question was talking about becoming dependent on the abraham broadcasts. you see, I feel not anything like that at all. in fact, I feel almost the opposite in a lot of cases, and is the main reason why I stopped listening to the abraham workshops. when it's just them reading the question, it's much more "aguantable" (tolerable) for me to listen to the question. so, to dedicate a little more than an hour or so of my time each week to listen to these outdated (in my mind) questions feels like a waste of time.

it feels to me like a long list of questions of people asking over and over how to stop blaming some circumstance for how they feel. covid-19, covid-19, covid-19, blah blah blah... buncha people looking for the condition of abraham to say something that makes they feel better so they can feel relief. if I wanted to feel people getting the feeling of relief, I would enjoy work as a therapist, but that's not at all interesting to me.

that perspective obvipusly slows me down, so I instead look for the "nugget" or some thing that pops into my head during the broadcast which is interesting to me. I didn't think it was possible at first, however, I have found, and is largely the reason why I write this document, that they do seem to wedge their message into the cracks -- but it has more to do with my reception of them.

so, I try to find and emphasise (by writing here about them here) these things that are important to me here. even today, I have found three really great things in this broadcast that are really valuable to me.

---

so, when someone asks if there's too much abraham, it kinda bothers me because I could only feel that when I'm back in the mode of needing relief. a long time ago, back in 2012, I was distraught over raquel and the whole tuenti thing and really was having a difficult time. I would listen to abraham all the time, because even though I was drinking a lot of coffee, smoking a lot of weed, and  drinking a lot of alcohol, I still couldn't find relief so abraham was invaluable for me to find some sort of relief. when I discovered mdma I stopped listening to abraham, because the mdma provided a whole lot more relief than they did (I just had to smoke it to feel the relief instaed of actively thinking about what they were saying, too -- so it was easier).

however, as I've gained my own ability to see and recognise the laws of the universe in everything and have proved to myself the reality of my vortex, I don't really need the feeling of relief anymore. I look forward to the time when I can actually sit down and ask them all sorts of questions to deepen my understanding of the laws of the universe's effect on certain things -- though it feels too like I am getting the answers to these questions faster and faster now, so it would appear that I need them less and less.

so, it's this big difficulty with me, because they really are there only to provide relief, because as soon as you get beyond your own need to have relief -- that is, you now are vibrationally much more in the vicinity of who you really are, you don't need them to answer those questions because you're capable of receiving the answer yourself. they seem to be working theirselves out of a job, for us "advanced" listeners, and continue to only provide relief to people, wanting all of us to not "need" them or anyone else, and for each of us to find it for ourselves. it's annoying, but yeah, I think there is a moment when it becomes too much abraham and you feel confident enough to go out on your own.

### 2020-04-26 03:27 - (2020-04-25)

#### (45:52) any taking score is sorta too soon

when I was younger, I often heard the fable(?) "don't count your chickens before they hatch" -- and I noticed that it seemed to have some sort of relevance in my life. it did seem that when I would start to believe (or rather "take score") of the what the manifestation appeared to be, before it manifested, then it seemed to not quite happen as I expected.

I noticed this most often when I was playing games. I would think to myself, "I'm going to win", or "I'm going to be top on the scoreboard" or I'll have whatever amazing score.

my mom always told me also when I was younger, "pride comes before a fall" -- which is how I came to understand how this anomaly seemed to work. I just figured that my "taking score too soon" was actually pride or haughtyness -- and that's why it didn't work out as I expected..

there was another thing that I never really understood as a kid either because (again using the example of playing games), sometimes I just *knew* that I was going to win or get some amazing score -- and I did, but other times it felt as if I was looking at the present condition and extrapolating or prejecting into the future what my score would be (given my progress), and in those cases, it seemed that the moment that I made that projection, my preformance seemed to be reduced, and I didn't get what was expected. this always bothered me, so it kinda made two questions in me here... but first...

so, when I take score too soon, it felt like I was amping up my belief in some expected outcome -- an expectation. however, an expectation is a belief and a desire, so that must mean that I didn't really believe it because the desire wouldn't have changed it. that's the problem.

I just remembered another thing that I know is that talking about something before it has manifest, can abort the manifesation if you're not fully lined up with it because it intruduces the vibration of the hearer of those thoughts into the mix.

so, what I postulate to have happened often when I would proclaim victory before it happened, is I would send out a thought vibration, and even though those others were playing counter-strike in some place quite a distance from me, they vibrationally would feel their defeat, it would amp up their desire to win which would trump my fragile belief based on a projection or extrapolation?

is that what happened? also, is that why it's never a good idea to take score too soon? it seems like someone who has a conflicting desire with my own, especially that we live in a place where there is a lot of perceived competition, someone's perspective of my belief in a manifestation, could trigger an increase in their own desire that I don't have the manifestation (because of the perceived competition), and therefore trump my manifestation.

it seems like that's quite possible. even if they were able to trump my manifestation with their desire, it seems like they would walk away with the manifestation they wanted (in this case for me not to win, or to win theirselves), but I for sure walk away with stronger desire, and them with less. it seems like I won energetically, even when I didn't win the physical game?

I know there's no energetic winning. I also know there's no energetic competition or comparing either. I'm mainly just trying to ask: do I walk away with more energy by "aborting" the manifestation?

---

taking score after the manifestation also seems to put a negative spin on things, too which again I equated to the pride before a fall thing. as a result I became less and less competitive. so, I think taking score in any way is about some sort of comparison to others or competition, so I am much more often in a state of appreciation about the things that have manifest -- and while I'm writing this now, I ignoring the mechanics of all of the details I was talking about earlier, instead if I were to appreciate my performance instaed of project it into the future, it seems like I wouldn't experience the degerdation of performance. in addition, even if it were the case that someone's desire for my anti-manifestation were to be boosted, they cannot overpower pure appreciation.

so, then I have another question which is that nevermind... I already answered it. it's appreciation that I'm looking for :) I do wonder about the mechanics though.. that stuff interests me because what if, for example, I wanted to purposefully sabotage myself and abort the manifestation on purpose for a for some large period of time -- then, when I wanted to, I could just turn to appreciation when I thought the manifestation was big enough -- or something like that :D


### 2020-04-30 21:50 - (2020-04-28)

I started watching this broadcast a bit earlier. I really liked two things they said so far:

1. that when you focus on one thing, you are essentially "blocking out" or making the other things dissappear -- however, even though that is what is happening, if you were to try to "block out" the other things, now you're giving your attention to them, which makes you focused on what you're "blocking out" -- which means they're not really blocked out after-all.

2. when you say, "mean what I say" -- you mean to say, "feel what I say"...

upon the second one, the day before yesterday, I had a monologue when I was out in the field about why it's so important for me not to lie. I stated that when I have different appearances to different people, then it's really hard to change the feeling (release resistance) to something, because I have so many different versions of me that are all putting different "meaning" on what I'm saying -- and ultimately, the reason why I'm maintaining so many different versions of the "truth" between different people, is because I care what they think about me.

caring what others think about me is mental baggage that slows you down, and is never useful -- because if you think about it, what you *think* someone thinks about you, impacts the way *you* feel, and so by caring what they think about something is producing a feeling in you, which is causing you to alter what you *mean* with your words to try and achieve what you think is the best feeling this person can give you.

---

then, they were talking about how to get to inspired action, and this is quite an easy thing for me to do now, cept it seems like when I "get in the zone" like they say, my computer gets shut down. I haven't worked out entirely what to do about that, other than to just continue to learn how to feel good anyway. they said something that inspired me to a thought about it, but I've since forgot it since my computer shut down...

I'll get it back :)

### 2020-05-04 23:41 - (2020-04-30)

(45:05) - as they were giving their "rampage", for whatever reason I had a pretty sudden realisation, on something that seems terribly obvious: instead of looking at all of the things that have not been going the way I want them to with my program, (which is tuning myself to the problem), just tune myself to my desire.. 5head

(47:31) - a few days back, there was this weird thing that happened where I was walking home and mr. motor was particularly angry with me that day. as I went, there were these two dogs out that are always quite a bit more ferocious when mr. motor is pissed off. they were again let out of their yard (it happened once before), but this time they were seemingly not going to let me go forward toward my home (they were between me and my house). I thought about going back, but for whatever reason I just thought I would wait for them to go away.

anyway, later, I was thinking about how I didn't seem interested in going back and only wanted to move forward, even if it meant going slowly. the owner finally called the dogs and I could walk home, but because one of the dogs did actually bite me kinda on the leg[^1] I was thinking to myself, what I should do is probably just keep going no matter what and if the dog bites me, I should just sue so I can get some money and smoke weed and maybe fund some ideas I have. I dunno.. mostly I want to buy drugs with it though.

I knew that I probably wouldn't *really* do that, because that would mean (for me to be able to sue), I would be pretty severely injured, and that may mean not watching stars or perhaps difficulty programming too, which wasn't really a cost I wanted to pay to smoke some weed. I sorta left the idea. there were a lot of reactions around it, but I decided I didn't want to make a thing out of it.

---

anyway, so they're talking just now about this woman who wants to sue, and right before they respond, the back of my leg immediately starts hurting where the dog bit me, and they say, «your source would never give you the impulse to sue someone» -- so I start thinking about that while they're talking about how disempowering it is to try and get your control (and receive resources) by suing someone, and I was thinking about how annoying mr. motor is, when they say, "it's not easy to all of a sudden begin to love someone and appreciate someone who has been unlovable and unappreciatable; we get that -- but don't do it for him, do it *for you*"

it was really those last two words that made me want to write this, because this whole time, I've been beginning to appreciate mr. motor in a lot of different ways because he's like free energy being added into the equation and stuff. I had another realisation the other night out while watching stars, that really I'm not even sure if I would have been able to get as far as I have if it weren't for mr. motor and all of his efforts. I dunno it's hard to explain the idea, because it's part of a bigger concept which is what I think is beginning to happen to everyone. I may talk about it more soon, because you can feel how much pushing against the last thing I wrote in gnomi's thoughtlog, and other things...

---

wait, what?!? then, they talk about -- not just appreciating him, but «bring a new tribe fourth, in him,» then following up further saying, «there was the tribe of [the] old [mr. motor] and now there's the tribe of [the] new [mr. motor], and it's the same phsical being -- but, it's a different vibrational tribe coming fourth»

wat??? I don't really know what to think about this actually.. I'm just going to leave it. I am pretty good at only seeing positive aspects in people who are not so desirable -- in fact just the other day, john michael was horrified to find out that I only look for positive (wanted) aspects in trump, even repurposing some of his antics I appreciated and making them my own.

[1]: for some strange reason, even though it didn't break the skin, it still really hurts, and hurts actually very considerably more while star-watching

### 2020-05-07 20:07 - (2020-05-02)

#### 45:14 - step-5 children

today I was thinking about the experience that I will have with the girls, and one of the things that my dad often told my mom was that it's ok to let me crash and burn. he's really right about it, because I have esssentially discovered a lot of things because of "accidents" or "failures" or other things. for people like me, wiping out is really importatant.

I really want to convince them (the girls) that being protective or trying to make things too easy is not really a good thing. when abraham was saying «you don't want to ever deprive them of a step-1 moment», I realised that was what I was wanting to convey. there's a difference between being overpprotective and making things too easy vs. giving someone opportunity and allowing them to fail at it.

another thing I want to mention is that in the previous question about the person with a 3, 4, and 5 year-old kids, is when they said that you could come back to find their antics as humorous -- you see, my dad perhaps was a bit extreme in this way, but he would *always* make jokes when I was having a hard time. I wanted to be sad and evoke his pity, yet instead he would always make fun, saying things like, "did you hurt the coffee table" (after I just did a face-plant into the corner) or when I was frusrated and angry, to call me "mr. sunshine".

perhaps that's a bit extreme, but by doing that he taught me how recoverable things always were. my dad has had multiple business failures and all sorts of things in his life that were "bad" but he always[^1] made fun of the moment and then recovered from it, which is much more a step-5 sort of thing. I think it's really important to realise that the ability to recover is a much better attribute in someone, than the ability to find perfection.

I'm more confident that I will be able communicate this sort of plasticity, now :)

#### 48:21 - with pain, there's always gain

in the previous question (about the woman with her son in a bad spot), and this one too with the mother in pain, I was thinking in both cases that you can't keep looking at he problem (their present condition) and be able to make headway on allowing them to improve in your own expectations for them. (this question is also resonating with my thoughts on mr. motor)

so, what I'm saying is that you cannot look at their present circumstances and allow things to be different. I had a similar experience with my prediciment with nosebook, where the situation simply would not change. it's quite literally unchangable, and unlike the son or the mother, there was no place I could go where these situations that were causing me distress, weren't there. these conditions followed me everywhere I went, so I had to find a new way to look at them...

this is when I began to learn how to "redefine" or to change my perception of something -- turn it from something that I perceived to be bad, to something that I perceived to be good. a lot of this was understanding that all of their influence on me, was actually just adding more energy (desire) into the equation, and that helped, but the problem still remained. there was no way to make the problem or the circumstances any different; I had to change my perception.

so as I'm listening to these questions, the thought pops into my head -- "it's not 'no gain without pain' -- because that implies that all gain comes from pain, but it certainly is true that all pain produces gain (more energy into the situation)" -- but, of course you have to line up with the gain part of it to get the vibrational gain into physical terms.. so I think I'm going to redefine that term now in my head to be "with pain, there's always gain" -- and that may be a good way to begin redefining these diffrent situations.

imagine again the woman that has her 3, 4, and 5 (the pythagorean kid triange) fighting over something... they're all just building up more energy; it's kinda like trash-talking before a match or whatever.

[1]: actually, not *always* -- moreso when I was younger, because I did notice that he didn't bounce back quite as easily after my parents' divorce. but still the cencept stuck for me.

#### 1:00:01 - music and feeling

the questioner described playing music and that music being turned into feelings. I always thought it was the opposite for me: when I listen to music, it creates undescribable (in words) emotions witin me. however, when I *played* music, then I would describe it as something that I felt as if the music was sort of like a medium for the emotion that I was feeling when I played to kind of live and thrive inside of.

I guess it could happen both ways though, so playing music could evoke feelings -- and I suppose that happened to me when I would play songs that I didn't feel, I always hated the way they sounded -- but, then the oppsite also could be true for listening to music as well, which is something I hadn't really thought of, but would make sense why festivals and raves are so effective: that while listening to music, the music is like a medium in which the emotion I'm feeling while listening to the music can live. interesting idea :)

### 2020-05-12 18:13 - (2020-05-09)

#### 11:22 vibrational accuracy

I just realised that when I say 'lie', what I am meaning is vibrational accuracy. you see when I was in spain, I would tell a lot of people a lot of different words (and a lot of it started with zaryn), about different deadlines or how I was doing or whatever, and I was feeling completely different. I had completely aligned myself to telling him what I thought he wanted to hear.

then, LOA got a hold of it, and that sort of pattern began to repeat in my life. there was augusto, xagly, etc. -- various people that ripped me off, and during all of it, I was telling them what I thought they wanted to hear rather than listening to or even saying what I really felt...

LOA contniued to expand on it and I find myself in a situation with nosebook -- basically, the embodiment of someone dedcated to only telling you what they think you want to hear, when their vibration is very different.

it was definitely a bit of a thing, how bad it got, for me to really begin to want to actually speak what I mean, and most of all discontinue to deceive myself so much.

I realised just now as they were talking, thst my own self-deceit was actually what attracted so much fraud around me. it also made the beginning part of the nosebook experience so slow. until I was able to accurately (without deceiving myself by saying what I (or others) wanted to hear), I wasn't able to really accurately determine where I really was, which made navigation really difficult.

---

learning vibrational accuracy is one of the most important things that I have learned, because I began to trust my feelings much more than anything else, and I was completely unable to do that because I had been trained (like children) to tell those in chargem what they want to hear.

#### new visuals...

a few times this episode, hey said things like, "new vantage point" or "new visuals" or "new way of seeing things" -- and it makes me wonder if more people than just me had a pretty significant vision upgrade. sometimes I wish I could actually talk to people that would give me a truthful answer, but that probably won't ever be, actually.

it's really weird, because the more things are like this, the more I find myself just going the way I want to go, no matter what. I'm kinda disillusioned with the whole reality is different for me sort of thing, where all conversations are controlled and stuff.

I was laying there this afternoon after waking up from sleeping for so much time lately and I'm totally exhausted all the time. I don't really know what is the problem because I don't really think I have much negative emotion going on... maybe actually thinkign about it now, it's like a dull frustration and lack of "zest" for life. I also have a pretty weird like 24/7 headache and loud sound in my right ear, and tons of sinus congestion... so physical evidence seems to show that I'm not doing so great. however, it seems like (actually I haven't checked in a fer days now) that I keep getting vision upgrades though, so something is working.

also, another weird thing is that it doesn't really feel like the coronavirus thing is done or something feels like empty or incomplete or something there too. I can't really describe the feeling very well, because I didn't really have much feeling around it anyway, but it feels like people, or me, or something, like there's desire that it doesn't go away. perhaps maybe that people will miss the time off or something. it's weird.

### 2020-05-20 11:16 - (2020-05-12) step 6

yay, they said step 6:

«and then step 6 is, you reemerging back into non-physical; back into the pure positive *energy* of who you really are»

I just loved what they said so much and I felt so much emphasis on the word energy when they said it. immediately, because of the word "reemerge," I thought of "death" -- but then I thought immediately afterward... wait what if you didn't need to physically *die* to reemerge into the pure positive *energy* of who you are...

then, I thought about what is energy. it's not necessarily physical, perhaps, and I would even go so far to say, that the pure positive energy they're talking about is *not* physical. however, energy has a dramatic effect on the physical (it's sorta the machinery running the show)...

following that I had a weird idea I never thought about: I often wondered how I could experience a dream-state like reality here in the physical world -- so the thought was, if I could be pure positive energy, then the physical world wouldn't need to change into a dream-state for me to experience that type of reality. *I* could transform (reemerge) into something that ... it made so much more sense before trying to explain it in words...

essentially, if I can "lose" (die) my physicality, then I would become a living dream-state kinda like able to move around like the vortextual version of myself. the barrier between these worlds wouldn't be separated anymore.

the reason why our dreams manifest the way they do is because they are the most logical manifestation of the way we feel -- like being imersed into an environment that is the manifestion of the way we feel -- and then within that environment of the way you feel, you are capable of only the things that your emotional state allows you to be capable of.

the barrier between the dream-state and the vortex/source version of you exists in your emotions and is perceived in a more relaxed (less resistant) state while you sleep.

therefore, if I am able to, master step-5 and feel the same way that my source feels, there's no longer that barrier, so the dream state can be realised here in physicality while in a non-resistant state (like while sleeping)

that's pretty big :)

#### 44:26 - disciplining my awareness of how I feel and displining myself to hold myself in that better feeling place for longer

as they were talking, I realised that is what I want. it's funny because I'm so military-like in so many aspecs of my personal development, but I don't have that military-like disipline in how I feel -- yet :) it seems like something I want to acquire

#### 53:27 - what is the next step of alignments

the questioner seems to be a step-4 master and, is asking what the next step of alignment is. I cut abramham off a little bit early, because I love this question so much. for me the next step here was realising that I didn't need to run from or try and avoid contrast. I could just let it be, knowing that it causes expansion, and it's just fine.

I don't need to "accept it" -- when in every way I would previously identify it as wrong, bad, or unwanted for me. however, I have the ability to look at it like my source sees it and it not only doesn't bother me, but I know that there are so many good things that will eventually come out of it.

I suppose this is step-5 (mastery?), but what it craeted in me was a complete sense or unmistakable feeling of invincibility or "unstoppableness". sometimes I mess up and I feel bad, but I don't have to even worry about it, because I can choose to find a way to change my perception of that bit of "contrast".

the reason why I think this is important, and perhaps why I think learning how to change one's perception to be something that feels good, is because I think it's perhaps a necessary skill to being a step-5 master.

in a previous segment abraham was talking about how esther had to first soften the emotional impact of jerry's transition by finding things to feel good about and practice that before trying to adjust the perception of the trauma. that's sorta, but not really what I'm talking about.

I'm talking about, how just like in step-4, you can quickly notice the off-ness of something and almost immediately get back to feeling good, you can notice the off-ness of the perception and almost immediately find and come into alignmnt with the source perspective of that.

it's truly one of the most empowering feelings ever. you have no idea how invigorating it is to see things from a broader perspective.

### 2020-05-24 01:24 - (2020-05-16)

#### (17:58) - calibrating now

the last few days, but especially today, I have noticed that I have been doing a lot of calbrating. I feel like I have to explain stuff, because the reactions are such, like for example, I was giving some ideas on the difficulty I had in the past with how I seemed to find it difficult... anyway, I suppose I'm even calibrating now again to it.

or, for example, I was trying to figure out today what would make someone feel a dilema. I know it happens always to me when I'm trying to figure something out logically instead of just following my feeling -- or if I don't really have strong feeling about it, just to pick one and go with it, instead of sitting back and trying to figure it out analitically.

I suppose both of those examples are calibration. the first one, I'm recognising that I don't really want to keep attracting that sort of thing, and the second one, I really did feel auhentic curiosity, because in the moment, I was beginning to see something I never had before, where I began to understand autistic people in a better way. john is a great example of a person for me to talk to because he's a lot like how I used to be before I began to embrace my emotions... anyway, I found the topic quite stimulating, and I still feel like I have more to discover in it, because it's really illuminating the "flip-side" of the emotional guidance system.

---

since it's starting to come (right now)... I began to see how when the person is trying to weigh the pros and the cons, and trying to figure out the direction to go logically, I noiced that same thing happens for me when I'm trying to figure out the "best" or the "right" way to make something when I'm programming... so, the big realisation came to me when I realised that by trying to find the best or right way, it was essentially the same thing as saying, I need someone to tell me what to do -- however, instead of someone (who I trust knows) telling me what to do, (and I can follow the rightness of their direction) -- instead I need to find out the right way analitically so that I don't make a mistake or waste some resources -- and that people (but mostly myself) will then be hard on me for selecting the wrong one.

it's kind of a funny topic, because talking about calibration, behind all of the trying to figure out the "right" or "best" way, and trying to avoid the feeling I will feel after having picked the "wrong" or a less optimal way. by trying so hard to avoid it by mulling it over logically, I am calibrating to to the failure or the less optimal one. I actually, now that I'm writing this, it seems like when I spent a lot of time thinking something over, I almost always certainly did pick the less optimal one, or I "missed" my chance by overthinking it.

I'm reminded of a situation today when I walked down to the field an hour earlier than I was shooting for. upon realising that, I couldn't figure out if I wanted to walk back or if I wanted to stay on the field and chill there. I started calculating the time wallking there 2 more times, and a whole bunch of other stuff and I couldn't come to a decision, when a big green tree caught my eye. I felt really attracted to the tree and wanted to go sit by it. finally I calmed my debating mind and went to the tree and had a good time.

again, I had a realisation upon getting to the top of the hill that I left my lighter at home, and my brain started thinking up all sorts of ideas like walking back and stuff. this time though, nothing interesting or feeling caught my eye and I just overrode the thing and decided to stay. I then spent the rest of the time looping in my head the above calibrating thoughts, which wasn't a good thing.

in short, I decided to stay and not go fetch my lighter because I didn't want to feel like I was addicted to cigarettes and I was thinking about how much situation "manipulation" was happening today and since it's about that time of year again (birthday and christmas) when nosebook tries to make stuff happen, I was hesitant to go back and preferred to stay there. now on hindsight, that's a really powerless sort of perspective I was calbrating to, and I probably should have walked back to get the lighter, even though neither way seemed to feel necessarily good or bad, but the calibration is what actually didn't feel as good. oh well.

those were calibrations against something. I'm going to begin to make more of an effort to begin calibrating toward things instaed of against stuff. it seems so simple and I say it enough that I feel like a bit of a hypocrite. oh well.

#### (31:02) - why do people feel competition with others?

for reals, I'm trying to understand it for a while now, and today I've given it even more thought than usual... speaking on the subject, this person said that her friend says many positive things, she senses competition...

from my perspective, she couldn't sense conmpetition if she wasn't competitive herself. I say that because I don't really feel competition from people. I look around at people around me, and any quality that I see a person have, that I like, I just "rip it off" shamelessly and make it my own...

so, since everyone is on this whole bandwagon of ripping stuff off (visual capabilitty or whatever) from those like me who have it, how then do people feel competition? why isn't everyone just ripping all of the good stuff off that they like (I don't of course mean physical objects)? I mean personaliy traits or lifestyle decisions, mental positioning or whatever...

it seems to me like such an absolute waste of effort to feel any competition with anyone else at all

(of course I don't mean the enjoyment of playing and winning competitons of game or sport).


### 2020-05-24 20:49 - (2020-05-19)

#### (56:05) - feel joy while negative emotion is present

huh... now this is an entirely new idea for me. I never really thought about it. I will have to try it next time. I often am so consumed by the negative emotion, trying to feel something so opposite would seem to me like an impossibility -- yet I know and have numerous times experienced pleasure inside of pain, so I guess it's possible. interesting :) thanks for sharing!

also, of note, earlier today in noseblog I said,

```
you don't really understand how much I would enjoy sitting down with someone and them being able to share new form of perception or advancement in thought patterns which allows for further optimisation of perception. it really would be fun, and that's why I'm so fired up to listen to abraham, because I always walk away with a new optimisation I can add to the amazing list of simple things one can do to opimise their energy output and overall feeling of well-being.
```

:D


### 2020-05-25 00:06 - (2020-05-21)

#### (02:22) inner being making decisions for you

so the questioner said, "I know my inner being wants this for me" -- and I immediately said that your inner being does not make decisions or assign things for you to do.. which I know is true. abraham followed up by saying...

«your inner being isn't deciding what you should want or how you should go about it. your inner being is just holding a vibration about what it is you *do* want. there's a subtle difference in that»

but then I realised that this has a lot to do with what I'm presently in the middle of. I suppose at this moment I'm presently looking for some sort of indication about what I *should* do, when claro I know that's not what I'm really looking for here. I'll explain better soon.

#### quick intermission to weigh the pros and the cons

I'm barely paying attention here. I'm just going to get my thoughts out first and hope for some clarity along the way as this broadcast continues.

the subject is described better in @[noseblog](2020-05-24 17:47) so I won't really go over it again. instead, I'll just jump right in.

I don't really have a problem not working on tech stuff, however history has shown me that if I don't have something I'm creating or holding my interest, I get bored, or, in the case of with raquel, tesions begin to rise as the creative energy created from sex begins to accumulate and there's no output. it does seem like a good idea to be creating something along the way. however, this is perhaps a bit early on in the process to be talking about this...

another reason is, simply how am I going to be able to explain to the girls the importance of creativity in one's life as a method to increase connection, when I'm literally not doing anything myself, and haven't been for the last 12 years now. I am, in my own perception a bit of a hypocrite in this area.. I mean, seriously how can people take me seriously when every attempt I've had at producing something creative in the last 12 years has been a chaotic mess.

the next big thing on my list is, I don't really enjoy the way my body feels physically. I know when I have experienced their system turned off, that I feel incredible and I have such amazing precision and flow to my movement, that I just would simply prefer to continue on doing what I'm doing getting closer and closer to achieving it. I know what I'm looking for and it seems closer than ever, so to give up now would sort of be like stopping to take a water break 4 feet from the finish line -- it just doesn't make sense to me.

that is exactly what they want though; they want to delay my reaching the finish line as much as possible. they want me to continue on having blurry vision, terrible balance, a bad cough, out of breathnesss, etc. etc. -- and I've noticed that the more vision upgrades I get, the worse it gets. so, they're essentially asking me to quit right in front of the finish line, and accept poor physical and mental conditions so that they can keep their ruse up.

to me, this literally makes no sense at all. why in the world would I do that? why would I willingly give up on all of those things when what I'm wanting is so close-by?

the future is also neither very clear to me, because then imagine we start the girls thing -- it just seems to me like the increase in energy from sex will further give more vision upgrades, which means I'll have an even more diminished experience. if they can actually hold me away from connection I think that eventually, my eyes will become so blurry I really won't be able to see much of anything anymore -- or, if they can't hold me, and I do get connected, they'll just simply say, "see look, if you have sex, you can get connected" -- which isn't at all what I'm about! nothing of the sort! I prefer the establishment of connection with me when it's just me. I prefer the alone approach to things, so I'm sure that the whole thing of what I said will be exactly opposite[^1].

I suppose the "good" which would come out of a message like "see, have sex and get connected" and then go and expend all of your sexual/creative energy trying to find your connction with people outside of you, instead of finding your connection inwardly. it certainly would make a whole lot of extra contrast as people put so much effort into really trying hard to find something inside of them externally. perhaps, that's what people want though. I just don't know..

so, just to recap: it seems obvious to me, whether I do the girls thing or not, I'm going to be spending the next X amount of time in increasingly more blurry conditions and disorienting conditions until I finally get conncted. it's going to happen one way or another, but if I'm with the girls when it happens, they have an "out" an illusion that they can give to people to keep them distracted from the only thnig that (in my opinion) really works, which is actually proper self-evaluation and optimisation.

I suppose people are going to get a whole lot of step-5 practice spinning their wheels in that illusion for so long. I dunno...

[1]: much like how I believe jesus' message was all about believing in yourself, and the church, needing to make an icon for people to believe in (that they controlled), instead had him say "believe in me" -- or maybe something like "you should believe in yourself like I belive in me" -- or something I dunno, but clearly to me it seems evident that what became the church was pretty close to the opposite of what he was intending to convey.

#### (27:30) - uncertainty, confidence and clarity

obviously, this fits right in. I don't really feel confidence and clarity in the subject at all. I don't really believe in doing things I'm unsure about, either -- and, like I said, it's absolutely a silly idea in my mind to go and against my natural way of doing thngs, and divert myself off into something I do not really feel terribly confident or much clarity in, right before the finsh-line -- where upon crossing it, I can guarantee that getting that alignment/connection, I will assuredly have a very real clarity and confidence.

you know, I could just jump right in and expect things to turn out ok, because they seem to for me, no matter after whatever amount of difficulty -- so In a sense I do have confidence -- I do not have much clarity on the matter though because at the moment, it certainly feels like the entire thrust of the decision is being made from a place of unwanted (they really don't want me to get connected, and they don't want anyone else to come to the realisation of where their true power is)

it would be kinda funny if I said yes anyway (after expressing what I did above) -- cause I was thinking about it, and let's say I did decide to say yes, right this very moment. then what?

how in the world are they going to try and make all of this happen? am I going to be escorted to a room or something? the picture that popped into my head was all of the various different brothels I've been in, where the whole selection process feels so unbelievsbly unnatural. certainly it wouldn't be like *that*, because it's not at all like that -- but still, that was the picture that I had of how bizarre the whole thing may seem to appear if too much making things happen, were to happen. I dunno.

---

it feels like it's such a too late sort of thing, but I really would think that there has to be some sort of a better logististics that were possible. in my opinion, the idea of making a website and having a common thing that we could work on (obviously not at professional speeds, but more like a hobby/learning project) and getting funding seemed to me like a much more natural approach than anything that I could possibly imagine that they're trying to come up with.

again on the confidence thing, (and it's funny because the previous question addressed this:)

«you [won't] lose your pitch -- unless, something that you really care about reveals itself to you with the opposite end of the stick and shows you how much you care about it; how important it is»

«when you've given a lot of thought to something and you've been very careful and specific about it and you thought you'd done a good job of explaining it to the others around you -- and then you realise that you hadn't communicated to them what you really meant; they don't get you; they don't know what you mean, and they get off on a toot and they perform something that is in the exact opposite of what you would have done, __if you had of been in on it__ and it makes you feel nuts, and it makes you feel out of control?»

I don't think it would bother me all that much actually, because I've actually sort of already been expecting, if they were to try and do the arrangement, that it would basically be exactly the opposite of what I would have wanted. I literally have zero (0) confidence that they could even come remotely close to it.

I am absolutely sure they're thinking, "we have to make this happen now before it gets any bigger or out of control, so let's just throw something together and try to get this big problem we don't want contained" -- and so they're going to try and throw something together.

so, if it's any consolation, it wouldn't at all make me feel nuts because it's so much of what I already expect, I had already been thinking about how to try and figure this one out, because if I take the humor approach and laugh and the disaster, then it could have negative results -- but then so does painting it as a disaster. I have to take an approach where, it's sorta like all the stuff in my life where I sorta just go, "ok, well here's where I'm at: let's figure it out now."

I suppose it would make me feel a little out of control, but I know that's already the objective: to make sure I'm *not* in control, so again, expected -- and really, this is coming from a place where I have control now? nope. I have zero control over my conditions. I only have control over my feelings, which now that I'm writing this, that's the perfect approach I was looking for. no laughing. no crying. we just have to find a way to feel good about it. you know like whatever man; it's gotta start somewhere, ya know.

#### (23:14)

«it's so normal to gravitate in the direction of your desire. that's why you have arguments with people. when they move in the direction of what you mean and what you want, __it is never appropriate to just give in to that__. it's much more appropriate for you to own what you want and speak what you want and explain what you want. there's nothing wrong with helping others understand your calibration process.»

«never calibrate to something you don't want, even for the sake of finding harmony and friendship with them because it will bite you over and over and over again. be true to yourself and true to your vortex -- and when you're consistently there, others will understand where you're coming from.»

#### (36:25) - pushing vs. pulling/attracting

as they were talking about how you can move by pushing against something to go forward or you can be pulled forward, I had an realisation come into my mind about why it's easier (in physics) to pull something rather than to push it. I imagined a truck and a trailer. in one scenario, the truck is pulling the trailer, and in the other the trailer is being pushed by the truck (or you could imagine that it's driving in reverse rather than hitched to the front bumper). when the trailer is being pulled or attracted, it follows along the road just fine, but not only does it take more effort to push the trailer, the trailer is quite easily going to turn in the direction of the way the road leans, and rapidly the trailer is at 90° or more beside the truck. the truck therefore has to constantly adjust it's own direction to be able to push the trailer in the desired direction while pushing, but when pulling, it effortlessly follows the truck.

it reminded me of the person in japan with the twin daughters. when you try to push kids, it's like pushing a trailer, but when you're pulling them along from a place of alignment, they follow easily. perhaps that last sentence is easier to say, when you're in alignment and they're following, navigating is so much easier.

#### (42:43) - electrical wonkyness

yeah man, I know how this is. lately I have had a difficult time with anything programming related. the only thing I can get any flow in is javascript, and that's probably only because I've been doing it for so long. it extends out into more than just electronics though, as it seems like a cloud of chaos seems to follow me at times, especially after a vision upgrade (or four). I used to be quite productive after watching stars or getting vision upgrades, but now the mental chaos is so great that I have noticed that I'm actually more productive in a less energised state after sleep, than I am after watching stars.

I have also had different experiences when I have begun to use the program of another person who feels probaably at least moderate amounts of resistance toward me (or my situation), and quite literally nothing works properly. it's the weirdest thing because it's software and it's a program, so it *should* behave exactly the same every time given the same inputs, yet for some reason I seem to come into contact with some obscure bug. sometimes I'm the problem and some really easy thing is completely clouded in my mind.

for example, about 2 years ago or so I was building something with elixir and I managed to write code that today looks like complete gibberish to me. I seemed to be able to write was enormously difficult code with ease, yet today I'm completely unable to do the most basic of things in the same language -- even though I would really consider myself to be in a much better place emotionally now than I was previously. if it were only me and where I was emotionally, I would say that the case of elixir doesn't make any sense at all, because I'm doing soo much better than I was.. it's weird

I also noticed that when I first got to spain, computers were my friend. I seemingly could do anything and I could find a way to get the computer to do what I wanted it to do. I then had some experiences which I definitely noticed some drastic changes in how the computers and my programming seemed to flow.

when I lived in utah, I had a much more multidimensional capability of seeing the program operating from more than one angle. in california, I didn't see it in so many dimensions but I did seemingly "know" where the things were and where it was I wanted to put them more easily.

when I was building tuenti and the project seemed to be something I was building according to my specifications, things went really well.

madrid though was different than california in the sense that I couldn't perceive the model of the program in my head with enormous detail like in california, but my desire to build things was so much stronger. I could program 20-30 hours in a 48hr period drinking inbetween sessions and still I kept producing more code and wanted to keep going. only extreme tiredness after much alcohol seemed to stop me.

after I had sex with a prostitute for my first time, I was in a programming stupor for about a week afterward and it never really recovered back to where it was before then.

I went to california after that and I was once again able to perceive the model in more complex way, but I was significantly more relaxed about it and worked way less hours on it. I was also a bit more theoretical in my approach.

on coke in madrid, I had enormous capability to do things never thought of or even been done before. the intensity with which I programmed was so incredible, and I just kept going to the next thing that felt good. I had no direction though and made a lot of complicated useless stuff. it's unfortunate how I was working on a project that lacked direction and the alcohol made it worse.

I could go on... programming and my relationship with my computer is enormously energetic and I know when it's flowing and when it's not. I've loved the feedback that programming gives me to indicate where my energy is at.

#### (57:42) - grounding

I dislike these hippie words, but there is a lot to be learned from how a tesla coil works.

the way it works is that you have a large primary coil with a few windings and it usually has a thick wire. I like to think of when current runs through the primary, because it's bigger, it's like desire happening in gross matter and it has a low voltage (pressure) and operates at frequency of the signal applied to it. each pulse creates a magnetic field, which then induces a magnetic field in the secondary coil.

the secondary coil is a smaller (but often taller) coil of thinner wires which is then connected to an antennae. when the magnetic field collapses, it will pull/attract electricity out of the air (it looks like lightning). I like to think of this as like our transformer which takes non-physical energy out of thin air and makes it physical -- and this transformation happens because of the desire created in the primary coil. the system is operating at a frequency (the rate of pulses put into the primary coil) but each pulse that gets attracted out of thin air into the antenna has a much higher frequency determined my the medium (air in this case) which it has to pass through to get to the antenna.

finally, the energy pulled out of the air has to go somewhere, so just as you would imagine, because the secondary coil is not connected to the primary coil in any way, it's only connection is to the ground. the other end of the coil is connected to the antenna. all of the lightning pulled out of the air has to go somewhere, and so the it passes down through the coil into to the ground.

I like to think of the primary coil as a simile to the human environment, and each pulse that goes through it like a desire that creates a magnetic field. then, secondary coil I prefer to think of as a simile to the human being: it transforms the magnetic field (desire) created by the primary coil into current, which it pulls out of the air (making non-physical, physcal) and gives it a path to the ground.

the way I understand it, if the secondary were not connceted to ground, no current would flow. yet, if you created a "virtual" ground, then energy would simply accumulate and not go anywhere -- sorta like static elecricity or a capacitor.

you have to give the non-physical energy that your desires summon a place to go :)

#### (58:16) - collapsing the wave function

they set it up perfectly when they were talking about the collapsing of the wave function when they said that the particle remains as energy even while it's been "collapsed" into a reality, and two scientists could observe the same energy and perceive two different things...

so then, when they said, «and then your inner being [...] stand in anticipation of your allowance of your perspective of what you've asked for, understanding that the energy will, not collapse into, or *not transform for all to see*, but for you to see -- and when enough of you are feeling the emphasis and power and stadiness of ease and love and interest and satisfaction, then *your world* evolves to that»

this "scientific" explanation is perhaps the best way I could describe a "time split" -- the energy exists but two scientists could perceive enirely different things out of the same energy depending largely on where the perspective of the scientist is at. they were saying just that and giving the explanation of how to do it throughout the whole broadcast, but must importantly when they were talking about the rain. when you make the transition from why it's something undesirable, to what is desirable, then you can make that transition and "collapse" the energy into something that you will perceive, and it may not necessarily be the same thing that everyone sees.

the reaction that I'm getting doesn't like the whole thing that we're going to have unique experiences because that seems like something unknown or uncontrollable (I'm probably picking up the reaction from nosebook). the collaboration of scientists will all see the same thing as long as they have a grouped hypothesis. you can join with the scientists, or you can mind your own business :) *I* personally recommend the latter.

### 2020-06-01 01:38 - (2020-05-30)

#### (13:37) - cable ready kids

when they were talking about the youngest ones adapting so well to your tecnology, they were obviously meaning the network -- and when they said it, I had this feeling which I don't really know how to describe, but it kinda felt like there was a whole lot of noticing that the network is perceived by many adults to be a pretty bad place, and the kids love it, but they're loving something naïvely, and it felt like a place where most adults don't really feel like they have any control over what is happening in their kid's heads, and the people operating it don't really have their best interests in mind. it felt really sad and out of control for me.

after that, there was this secondary feeling like now all of a sudden something that was going to soothe their feelings of uneasiness (me), was now not going to be participating in the way that they thought I would, and so now, they no longer had an excuse or a way to feel good about something that they perceive to be a devious and manipulative system of influencing such naïeve children.

however, I know that "things are always working out for me" -- and I know that it's really not as bad as we imagine it to be -- because really, they can't think for you; sure they can put thoughts into your head, but you only receive them if you're resonant to that vibration to begin with -- and they certainly cannot feel for you. they can neutralise a whole lot of visceral (physical) feeling, but the more subtle vibration behind it is still there.

---

I had a realisation after that experience feeling those things that I still have, to some degree a sense that these kids are being taken advantage of -- which from a non-phsical perspective, that is clearly not the case.

so, let's take the example of this new racism thing in minneapolis (57:44) or the example of the flat earth frenzy that happened back in 2016 (or the covid-19 frenzy). it feels to me like they have attached certain emotional triggers to these things to focus (distract) the person by focusing their emotion toward something which they can push against.

abraham said in the last episode that esther wept for quite some time after seeing it -- which means two things to me: 1. the sensitivity of people is so greatly amplified probably because of massive amounts of DMT in their heads and 2. that normally, they probably have people's sensitivity turned way way down, like they do for me on almost everything. so, when they put the emotion in the person and allow the person to feel it at full volume, it feels very very very real.

ever notice how in a dream (you have lots of DMT in your head during a dream) when you witness something, it feels much much more real to you, and that's cause the emotion is so much more intensified (the effect of the DMT)? well, when the emotion feels that strong to you, it feels real. any more strongly feeling, and that emotion would begin to become manifest in some physical form. esther wept considerably, but that could have only happened if esther was already resonant to that emotion in the first place.

so, sure the kids are naïvely using a new technology that's tossing them about on the neworked controlled sea of emotion -- and certainly there's going to be a whole lot of (perceived as) "bad" things happen as a result, but there's no better way to learn how to direct and control emotion that feels real like that, than by having the experience of it. I'm sure that the next time esther will not have nearly as much of an uncontrollable reaction to it.

I think this was my first time really beginning to see things from the eyes of source. I think I'm making progress :)

#### (46:44) - wat?

the person asked if the racial stuff was distracting people from their focus on the virus, and that's why it is diminishing. abraham follows up by saying,

«we've been saying for a long time that if all of the people on the planet could find the same subject and push against it all at the same time, it would be the end of you»

wat?? I totally missed the connection here. I understand both of them, but I don't see the connection. I'm going to think about it a bit more, but perhaps that was an encoded answer to the people in charge at nosebook...

<conspiracy hat on>
	if there was effort to try and get all of the people on the planet to to try and focus on the virus all at once, it could be that this whole race thing was a completely unexpected thing by those totally trying to run the show, because while they're trying to keep people feeling disempowered with the virus, all of a sudden the racial thing shows up, and now the disempowerment from the virus that people were focused on is totally thrown out the window, as people now want to get angry (better than powerlessless) and try to take their power back.
</conspiracy hat on>

interesting idea :) I have a feeling that some of john and my conversation may have also had a similar effect. lol, reminds me of what jerry said that he purposfully got angry because he thought it was the most productive thing that could happen in that moment.

«which it will never be -- because, you're diverse enough varied enough, standing with enough different perspectives, that your diversity will cause that balance to right itself over and over and over again. this is exactly the obvservation we were talking about»


#### (49:03) - vowel movement

as they were talking out which side of the movement are you on, it reminded me of a gameshow segment that I made up called "vowel movement"

the way you play it, so you see a word on the screen, and you remove all of the vowels... oh the idea came to me after watching the south park episode anyway...

N_GG_RS

ok, now you have to guess which vowels your "opponent" has chosen -- and your opponent is picked by the studio to be someone who is close to you, like say your wife or someone close to you. you have very little time to complete the puzzle, and you have to select the vowels which you think your opponent would see first, and they have to pick the vowels that you see first. if both of you pick the same vowels, you get a prize...

in order to write this software, it's really simple: you just scan the dictionary for all words that have one or more vowel that can change.

the secret to it is to make there be a time limit, so that people do not have much time to think about things which are "right" to say. there will be a whole lot of mundane english words in there, and with only a few seconds to try ad figure it out, when a taboo-looking word pops up, it'll always get the best reaction. so, in the example above if you thought that your partner would pick "NAGGERS" over "NIGGERS" (and they did) you get 50 points and the announcer moves on with a completely straight face..

#### (49:36) - peace on earth

I have never thought that peace would be something that is realised on earth, in the sense of needing to defend one's difference of opinion, territory, and posessions. although I do think that people can give up on the idea of posessions and territory quite a bit -- in fact, I think it will happen quite a bit as we move closer and closer to the realisation of the idea of being a "global village" (prophesied by mcluhan and popularised by leary). in order for that to become a reality, people will begin to respect each other's space, and what we thought of previously as posessions will become more in the sense of shared utility (think open source for ideas on how that could be). it's just that collaboration usually feels better than closed and guarded.

don't get me wrong: I'm sure there will still be a whole lot of territory and possesion and guardedness happening especially within the state controlled entities, but it seems to me (and I've already seen a lot of it come out of this lockdown) that people are more approachable now (as weird as that seems).

even though, I think that "peace" (needing to defend one's difference of opinion, territory, and posessions) is still quite a ways off, but in all statistics (even though the news would want you to think otherwise), violence is (and has been) on rapid decline. so, if "peace" to you means virtually zero violence, I think it's a lot closer than we think, honestly.

#### (53:10) - life is not a comptition because...

I wanna try too :) I would say, "life is not a competition because every person has their own individual metric of what is the best -- and the means to achieve it"

#### (08:15) - butterflies and blue glass

as they're preparing to tell the story that we've all undoubtedly heard numerous times, as they were setting it up, I remembered another time that they set up the story by saying that she wanted a fortune teller, they said... «she was not wanting to hear from us how to create her own reality. she was wanting to profess her discomfort in things thatwere missing and she wanted us to put them into place» ... and as they were saying that, this image popped into my head of someone quite similar to how I would imagine mr. motor to be -- the closest real-life example of the feeling I felt this person to be like was similar to marcos.

anyway, that person clearly just wanted to be told the things that should be done and didn't want to use any conscious effort to begin to mould and direct the energy with their thoughts. I could feel the discomfort and anger that this person felt as they were beginning to feel as they tell the story, to where at the end, we know she hangs up the phone.

---

I always wondered what was the catalyst to having such a tangible manifestation for something esther had such little energy invested in it. well, it became obvious to me as they were talking, that this woman provided the strong energy needed to make such a tangible manifestation happen by her anger, frustration toward esther and what a crappy fortune teller abraham was.

there's a bigger thing happening here that this story was telling me, because these step-1ers like this woman provide significant energy into the tanglibleness of the manifestation by their pushing against.

---

in the story, what abraham does is has this woman focus for a minute or so on some things that were easy for esther to realise as a manifestation. they did this by having her focus on the different types of blue glass, the different colours, opacity, etc. same thing with the butterflies and the feathers.

this woman probably stormed away from the telephone conversation saying, "this is so stupid! I ask about these big important problems that I have and they want to talk about blue glass and butterflies.. what a crock!"

abraham also groups subjects and topics together, so it's important to note that all this comes right after a questioner asked the question, "why does it seem like the opposite thing happens when I speak what I want"

---

it's really interesting to me the subject of "allowing" -- because the best state is one of contentment or satisfaction, one with no strong energy in either direction. I have noticed in my own life that when I talk to others or even let the thought become an intention (kinda hard when people are listening in on my thoughts), I notice that the opposite seems to happen a lot of times, and it seems that it happens most when I am feeling either really good or really bad about something.

there really is an art to lightly desiring something and experiencing satisfaction over even good feeling or strong pleasure or something. I haven't quite worked it all out, but when people see you feeling that good, they can have desire for the opposite to happen to you -- which just puts more energy into the manifestation, and only really delays it and potentially evolves it into something even more desirable, so it's not really a big deal anyway.

I want to revisit this subject in the future after I've figured more of these subjects out. I purposefully didn't make all of the correlations that are there in this story. it's quite intricate in how simple this story is, but describes energetic interactions so well.

it's also worth noting that following this story is the topic of appreciation, where abraham talks about introducing other vibrations into the mix
