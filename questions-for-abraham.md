# questions for abraham

as I'm listening to the 4 days a week livestream, I often inspire questions in me. I have no intention of askingt them directly, but they're kinda fun for me to write and think about the question, anyway.

### 2020-04-05 19:??

in the visual metaphor of the "gap" between me and where my inner being is, you gave me the image that as someone lives life their inner being continues to catch (and go with) the expansion that life provides, and sometimes you can close that gap (never can fully) between your physical reality and your vibrational (inner being) reality -- yet, if you don't close that gap, the image that I got is that because your inner being only focuses on your desires and never the gap, the gap would continue to widen and widen until it becomes no longer bearable and you finally die. if one is capable of continually closing that gap, would death continually be prolonged until that gap widens too much?

it seems to me that if that were the case (I think it probably is), then as life continues, the momentum gained by closing the gap would get one "moving" so rapidly, that either the gap would widen really really rapidly and death would come quickly. followup question: would it be possible to get so good at closing the gap, and have so much momentum in it, for life to no longer able to provide big enough contrast to maintain that momentum? (kinda far-fetched, and I know the first step is getting that kind of momentum, but I'm pretty sure I can accomplish it and was wondering.. I have no problem with dying so I think I would probably just want to experience it again with new eyes and just release my consciousness)

esther was having difficuly reading the cards. however, from my experience, I find this to be unlikely. for me, the more connected I am, the more clarity my eyesight seems to have. does abraham unfocus (blur) esther's eyes because if she were to actually see with the clarity of that much connction, she would be mind-blown by the beauty of even the most mundane details, and this would take her out of the dream-like state she's in? I believe it is likely blurred.

#### I feel like...

probably abraham isn't blurring her vision. it's probably the network operators that feel that anytime someone has a lot of connection (DMT) then it needs to be controlled. I'll continue on with further questions in the future. cause, it begs the quesion, why is it necessary to blur our vision when we're connected? I feel like it's to ensure that we're not capable of visually creating 3d objects in space with our imagination.. anyway..

### 2020-04-05 19:??

that brings me to the followup: the other thing I've noticed is that my eyesight is a product of how much resistance (how much contradictory vibration) I'm offereing in relation to who I relly am. I have noticed on drug experiences, when I boost my DMT levels without releasing resistance, my vision improves, yet I feel a very strong "swooning" sensation, as if I'm "stepping back" or getting pulled sidways into a swirling vortex. this seems to happen because there is so much extra physical detail that my brain kind of overloads, as it's not yet used to that faster speed. if her vision weren't blurred would she feel constantly feel that overwheming sensation of so much detail?

### 2020-04-05 19:??

related to the last question: is that visual blurring what the guys at the network are doing to me? when I finally get connected will that amount of detail seem very overwhelming to me? every time tesla went through his massive visual upgrades, he would describe the world as being very difficult to live in, having the hearing accuity to hear flys landing and such (before he got used to it). when I finally get connected, will I have a similar experience? I have often times felt like I will need a period of time -- perhaps weeks or months to be able to accustom myself to the visual and auditory clarity that I am sure is there, even though is being withheld from me by the network operators. how long of a recovery time will I need?

one of the things that I was feeling the other day (I haven't slept since) was your words saying «we wouldn't fight against anything» -- giving me the impression that perhaps I should begin to become a "cooperative component" to nosebook and just let them do their stupid maintenance on me while I sleep[^1].  their maintenance doesn't really impede my ability to watch stars... it does affect my programming though -- but most of all, I have difficulty going to sleep because I typically feel so much better than I do after I awake...

in the presentation, you were talking about allowing: «you will never disconnect from your source energy and your well-being by wanting to be a helpful person to another» -- while that doesn't directly apply to my question, I do get the impression maybe I should start becoming more "cooperative".

---

one of the strange things that is the kind of person that I am, is I don't really want to give up te fight. I'm so comfortable and so good at continuing to get out ahead of their antics, and I can see that I continually get more and more vision upgrades too. I really want to continue to go on until I find a way to simply overpower them in some way -- or something like that. I know it's not exactly "allowing", right, but I'm just having so much fun with the feeling that *I* am the creator of my reality, and no matter how hard they try, I can still continue to surpass my number of vision upgrades per week number -- and at the same time I'm really getting a lot of practice. being the kind of extremist that I am, it seems that perhaps I'm almost going to the opposite extreme of victimhood, and I've become addicted to the visceral resistance they provide for my everyday experience. I've come to really enjoy the fight perhaps, because it feels so great to be constantly winning.

perhaps I am a bit to "science" oriented with my approach to deliberate creation and need to begin to allow things. above I almost said, "I'm addicted to the contrast" -- but I don't believe that I'm addicted to seeing the great difference between us anymore... I really think I'm addicted to the conflict and the resistance it provides to make my life exciting, more than the contrast.

I've begun to program more effectively lately, but again it's with the help of coffee, and I really like the creativity involved in it too. last night, when I was out watching stars, I wanted to program so badly that I went home early to program and drink coffee. I got some stuff done, but not a lot; by the time I got home I had nearly completely lost the strong desire I had to program. because I can't feel the desire consistiently, I tend to default to going out and sirring up a bunch of conflict to get feeling things again. it's more invigorating to feel like I'm winning a conflict (over control of my body), than it is to slog my way through the programming with little connection (feeling) to what I'm creating.

I don't believe that becoming a "cooperative component" will regain that feeling. I've tried that, sleeping lots and stuff, and I essentially sit around a zombie watching dota or youtube.

I feel like I'm sort of forced to continue on with the conflict for as long as it continues on. I don't have any real issue with getting into more of an "allowing" (cooperative) mode, but it doesn't make me feel good or productive.

help?

#### the answer that I felt

what I'm really looking for is the *path of least resistance* -- or the *path of most allowing*. I know what I don't want, so now I *should* be able to just pivot toward what I do want. I really felt like when there's no more resistance in me, then I'll actually see far more improvement than I am presently, so I guess I'll try being a bit more cooperative. it's kinda hard to put into words what I felt, but I think I got it.

«your inner being isn't in resistance. your inner being isn't pushing against the problem; your inner being is only giving undivided attention toward the solution. being in resistance is pushing against the solution. being in alignment with your inner being is being non-resistant (or less resistant)»

I think I'm going for full non-resistance now.

a little later on (41:00) you talked about how when resistance rises higher and higher, it summons stronger and stronger desire. when that happens, if you focus on te desire (what you want), your beliefs don't matter so much anymore... that's what I've been doing: I've gotten so good at amping up desire and then moving in the direction of them, that even though I still have some less-than-productive beliefs, I can still get the manifestation that I'm looking for (usually vision upgrades). so while I'm really good at releasing resistance and focusing in the direction of my desire, I *still* have some beliefs that aren't suiting me very well. I think that's what the thinking more in terms of "path of most allowance" now is kind of about -- instead of thinking in less-resistant ways to allow the desire.

I don't know if I explained myself very well, but there's a fine line between thinking less resitantly and thinking in more allowing: if my tuner is set to a lot of resistant things and I begin allowing more, I get a whole lot more unwanted stuff. however, if I'm generally not so resistant, and I begin allowing more, then I let in a lot more *wanted* stuff.

it's kinda funny what I'm saying because I'm saying that essentially I've gotten so good at feeling the reality of the desire (like the vision upgrade), that it manifests so quickly now -- yet my thoughts, beliefs, even though they provide my with sufficient resistance, it doesn't matter because I'm so good at feeling. now, I want to get good at thinking.

[1]: one of the interesing things is mr. motor roared his engine every time I had that idea, whic was a bit interesting to me too, because it seems to me maybe they "need" the fight?

I have begun to try to meditate on a relatively daily basis now for no other reason than I really like my meditation spot. I stopped meditating for quite a while because it's become there's so much stuff going on when I do it, that I find it actually easier to "meditate" in daily life than it is to sit down and try to get connected to my source.

previously, I used to be able to quiet my mind quite easily, however lately I have noticed that I'm able to quiet my mind, but then another mind begins to start thinking. it really feels like I have 2-4 brains in my head thinking thoughts. I first observed the two minds thinking.. I would quiet one, then the other one would start to talk. I would focus in on quieting that one by observing it, and then either the first one would start again or a third one would begin.

previously, I would simply calm myself sufficiently to begin observing myself focused on something (like a star or my breathing), that I could easily get that good relaxed feeling.

it's hard to explain what I mean because I make it sound like there's these audible brains are competing, when it's more like the more I relax the presently one in focus, then I begin to hear another one that's speaking even softer. often times the stuff doesn't make much sense or it seems to be the exact thing that'll cause the most contrast for those listening in.

I can distinctly notice at least 2-4 different things happening. there perhaps may be more, but I've only been able to become aware of 4 of them max so far. man do they cause a whole lot of trouble and are impossible to get to quiet down. it feels like an out of control elementary school classroom in my head kinda.

I don't feel like it's a bad thing, and it doesn't feel like someting that's negative. in fact, quite the contrary, because it feels like I'm beginning to have 4 different trains (hehe) of thought at once. I've already noticed that I can pretty often have 2 trains of thought at once -- not like multi-tasking where it's like time slicing, but more like 2 people talking at once, and it feels too like I'm beginning to be able to become conscious of both of their words at the same time, too.

I'm kinda encouraging its growth, because I can only imagine how difficult it will be to keep track of my thoughts if two or more minds are thinking at once. it's causing havoc though because I'm having a lot of thoughts I normally wouldn't think start to pop out from time to time and it's becomming uncontrollable.

is there anything you can do to help me understand this?

#### where I'm headed with it presently...

because it feels like a bunch of schoolchildren all shouting things at once, it feels absolutely uncontrollable by me. during my meditation, the only way I can get any sort of cehesion is to focus them all in one direction. the focusing mechanism is totally rudimentary at the moment, but it seems to respond to feeling more than anything. if I can focus on how my heart feels or how some subject feels, I get feeling responses which are easy to work with, compared to the chaos of the "voices" or "thought" (cause I dunno if they make a sound to those listening in).

I dunno I'm just going to keep going with it and see what I discover with it.. feeling 4 things at once is easy compared to listening to 4 thoughts at once, so it feels like I want to try an keep it more heart/feeling focused than to let it go up to the throat or down to the imagination. I've been experimenting with how I can amplify it so it skips the emotions and imagination and goes all the way down to the "root" (dunnno how to describe this)... or, in the other direction, past the throat and the invisible sight and all the way up to the "crown" (again hard to explain what those are like).

I think I'm doing ok, so far,
