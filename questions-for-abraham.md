# questions for abraham

as I'm listening to the 4 days a week livestream, I often inspire questions in me. I have no intention of askingt them directly, but they're kinda fun for me to write and think about the question, anyway.

### 2020-04-05 19:??

in the visual metaphor of the "gap" between me and where my inner being is, you gave me the image that as someone lives life their inner being continues to catch (and go with) the expansion that life provides, and sometimes you can close that gap (never can fully) between your physical reality and your vibrational (inner being) reality -- yet, if you don't close that gap, the image that I got is that because your inner being only focuses on your desires and never the gap, the gap would continue to widen and widen until it becomes no longer bearable and you finally die. if one is capable of continually closing that gap, would death continually be prolonged until that gap widens too much?

it seems to me that if that were the case (I think it probably is), then as life continues, the momentum gained by closing the gap would get one "moving" so rapidly, that either the gap would widen really really rapidly and death would come quickly. followup question: would it be possible to get so good at closing the gap, and have so much momentum in it, for life to no longer able to provide big enough contrast to maintain that momentum? (kinda far-fetched, and I know the first step is getting that kind of momentum, but I'm pretty sure I can accomplish it and was wondering.. I have no problem with dying so I think I would probably just want to experience it again with new eyes and just release my consciousness)

### 2020-04-05 19:??

esther was having difficuly reading the cards. however, from my experience, I find this to be unlikely. for me, the more connected I am, the more clarity my eyesight seems to have. does abraham unfocus (blur) esther's eyes because if she were to actually see with the clarity of that much connction, she would be mind-blown by the beauty of even the most mundane details, and this would take her out of the dream-like state she's in? I believe it is likely blurred.

#### I feel like...

probably abraham isn't blurring her vision. it's probably the network operators that feel that anytime someone has a lot of connection (DMT) then it needs to be controlled. I'll continue on with further questions in the future. cause, it begs the quesion, why is it necessary to blur our vision when we're connected? I feel like it's to ensure that we're not capable of visually creating 3d objects in space with our imagination.. anyway..

### 2020-04-05 19:??

that brings me to the followup: the other thing I've noticed is that my eyesight is a product of how much resistance (how much contradictory vibration) I'm offereing in relation to who I relly am. I have noticed on drug experiences, when I boost my DMT levels without releasing resistance, my vision improves, yet I feel a very strong "swooning" sensation, as if I'm "stepping back" or getting pulled sidways into a swirling vortex. this seems to happen because there is so much extra physical detail that my brain kind of overloads, as it's not yet used to that faster speed. if her vision weren't blurred would she feel constantly feel that overwheming sensation of so much detail?

### 2020-04-05 19:??

related to the last question: is that visual blurring what the guys at the network are doing to me? when I finally get connected will that amount of detail seem very overwhelming to me? every time tesla went through his massive visual upgrades, he would describe the world as being very difficult to live in, having the hearing accuity to hear flys landing and such (before he got used to it). when I finally get connected, will I have a similar experience? I have often times felt like I will need a period of time -- perhaps weeks or months to be able to accustom myself to the visual and auditory clarity that I am sure is there, even though is being withheld from me by the network operators. how long of a recovery time will I need?

### 2020-04-08 17:20 - (20-04-07|27:32)

one of the things that I was feeling the other day (I haven't slept since) was your words saying «we wouldn't fight against anything» -- giving me the impression that perhaps I should begin to become a "cooperative component" to nosebook and just let them do their stupid maintenance on me while I sleep[^1].  their maintenance doesn't really impede my ability to watch stars... it does affect my programming though -- but most of all, I have difficulty going to sleep because I typically feel so much better than I do after I awake...

in the presentation, you were talking about allowing: «you will never disconnect from your source energy and your well-being by wanting to be a helpful person to another» -- while that doesn't directly apply to my question, I do get the impression maybe I should start becoming more "cooperative".

---

one of the strange things that is the kind of person that I am, is I don't really want to give up te fight. I'm so comfortable and so good at continuing to get out ahead of their antics, and I can see that I continually get more and more vision upgrades too. I really want to continue to go on until I find a way to simply overpower them in some way -- or something like that. I know it's not exactly "allowing", right, but I'm just having so much fun with the feeling that *I* am the creator of my reality, and no matter how hard they try, I can still continue to surpass my number of vision upgrades per week number -- and at the same time I'm really getting a lot of practice. being the kind of extremist that I am, it seems that perhaps I'm almost going to the opposite extreme of victimhood, and I've become addicted to the visceral resistance they provide for my everyday experience. I've come to really enjoy the fight perhaps, because it feels so great to be constantly winning.

perhaps I am a bit to "science" oriented with my approach to deliberate creation and need to begin to allow things. above I almost said, "I'm addicted to the contrast" -- but I don't believe that I'm addicted to seeing the great difference between us anymore... I really think I'm addicted to the conflict and the resistance it provides to make my life exciting, more than the contrast.

I've begun to program more effectively lately, but again it's with the help of coffee, and I really like the creativity involved in it too. last night, when I was out watching stars, I wanted to program so badly that I went home early to program and drink coffee. I got some stuff done, but not a lot; by the time I got home I had nearly completely lost the strong desire I had to program. because I can't feel the desire consistiently, I tend to default to going out and sirring up a bunch of conflict to get feeling things again. it's more invigorating to feel like I'm winning a conflict (over control of my body), than it is to slog my way through the programming with little connection (feeling) to what I'm creating.

I don't believe that becoming a "cooperative component" will regain that feeling. I've tried that, sleeping lots and stuff, and I essentially sit around a zombie watching dota or youtube.

I feel like I'm sort of forced to continue on with the conflict for as long as it continues on. I don't have any real issue with getting into more of an "allowing" (cooperative) mode, but it doesn't make me feel good or productive.

help?

#### the answer that I felt

what I'm really looking for is the *path of least resistance* -- or the *path of most allowing*. I know what I don't want, so now I *should* be able to just pivot toward what I do want. I really felt like when there's no more resistance in me, then I'll actually see far more improvement than I am presently, so I guess I'll try being a bit more cooperative. it's kinda hard to put into words what I felt, but I think I got it.

«your inner being isn't in resistance. your inner being isn't pushing against the problem; your inner being is only giving undivided attention toward the solution. being in resistance is pushing against the solution. being in alignment with your inner being is being non-resistant (or less resistant)»

I think I'm going for full non-resistance now.

a little later on (41:00) you talked about how when resistance rises higher and higher, it summons stronger and stronger desire. when that happens, if you focus on te desire (what you want), your beliefs don't matter so much anymore... that's what I've been doing: I've gotten so good at amping up desire and then moving in the direction of them, that even though I still have some less-than-productive beliefs, I can still get the manifestation that I'm looking for (usually vision upgrades). so while I'm really good at releasing resistance and focusing in the direction of my desire, I *still* have some beliefs that aren't suiting me very well. I think that's what the thinking more in terms of "path of most allowance" now is kind of about -- instead of thinking in less-resistant ways to allow the desire.

I don't know if I explained myself very well, but there's a fine line between thinking less resitantly and thinking in more allowing: if my tuner is set to a lot of resistant things and I begin allowing more, I get a whole lot more unwanted stuff. however, if I'm generally not so resistant, and I begin allowing more, then I let in a lot more *wanted* stuff.

it's kinda funny what I'm saying because I'm saying that essentially I've gotten so good at feeling the reality of the desire (like the vision upgrade), that it manifests so quickly now -- yet my thoughts, beliefs, even though they provide my with sufficient resistance, it doesn't matter because I'm so good at feeling. now, I want to get good at thinking.

[1]: one of the interesing things is mr. motor roared his engine every time I had that idea, whic was a bit interesting to me too, because it seems to me maybe they "need" the fight?

### 2020-04-08 19:24

I have begun to try to meditate on a relatively daily basis now for no other reason than I really like my meditation spot. I stopped meditating for quite a while because it's become there's so much stuff going on when I do it, that I find it actually easier to "meditate" in daily life than it is to sit down and try to get connected to my source.

previously, I used to be able to quiet my mind quite easily, however lately I have noticed that I'm able to quiet my mind, but then another mind begins to start thinking. it really feels like I have 2-4 brains in my head thinking thoughts. I first observed the two minds thinking.. I would quiet one, then the other one would start to talk. I would focus in on quieting that one by observing it, and then either the first one would start again or a third one would begin.

previously, I would simply calm myself sufficiently to begin observing myself focused on something (like a star or my breathing), that I could easily get that good relaxed feeling.

it's hard to explain what I mean because I make it sound like there's these audible brains are competing, when it's more like the more I relax the presently one in focus, then I begin to hear another one that's speaking even softer. often times the stuff doesn't make much sense or it seems to be the exact thing that'll cause the most contrast for those listening in.

I can distinctly notice at least 2-4 different things happening. there perhaps may be more, but I've only been able to become aware of 4 of them max so far. man do they cause a whole lot of trouble and are impossible to get to quiet down. it feels like an out of control elementary school classroom in my head kinda.

I don't feel like it's a bad thing, and it doesn't feel like someting that's negative. in fact, quite the contrary, because it feels like I'm beginning to have 4 different trains (hehe) of thought at once. I've already noticed that I can pretty often have 2 trains of thought at once -- not like multi-tasking where it's like time slicing, but more like 2 people talking at once, and it feels too like I'm beginning to be able to become conscious of both of their words at the same time, too.

I'm kinda encouraging its growth, because I can only imagine how difficult it will be to keep track of my thoughts if two or more minds are thinking at once. it's causing havoc though because I'm having a lot of thoughts I normally wouldn't think start to pop out from time to time and it's becomming uncontrollable.

is there anything you can do to help me understand this?

#### where I'm headed with it presently...

because it feels like a bunch of schoolchildren all shouting things at once, it feels absolutely uncontrollable by me. during my meditation, the only way I can get any sort of cehesion is to focus them all in one direction. the focusing mechanism is totally rudimentary at the moment, but it seems to respond to feeling more than anything. if I can focus on how my heart feels or how some subject feels, I get feeling responses which are easy to work with, compared to the chaos of the "voices" or "thought" (cause I dunno if they make a sound to those listening in).

I dunno I'm just going to keep going with it and see what I discover with it.. feeling 4 things at once is easy compared to listening to 4 thoughts at once, so it feels like I want to try an keep it more heart/feeling focused than to let it go up to the throat or down to the imagination. I've been experimenting with how I can amplify it so it skips the emotions and imagination and goes all the way down to the "root" (dunnno how to describe this)... or, in the other direction, past the throat and the invisible sight and all the way up to the "crown" (again hard to explain what those are like).

I think I'm doing ok, so far,

### 2020-04-10 18:23 - jumbled brain & fighting against

I have had more indecision than normal lately. this morning, I couldn't figure out if I wanted to go to sleep or to go take a long walk and meditate. I wasn't terribly tired, so I decided I wanted to take a long walk and meditate on the hill. when I came back, I still didn't feel tired so I went to begin programming...

obviously someone doesn't like me programming (or something), because it also happens with youtube videos or even after playing hearthstone... they shut down my computer. I haven't really figured out a pattern to it, so there's no way I can try to cooperate at all with it. it just seems like the person turning off my computer just at seemingly random doesn't like things.

it's funny though, because, for example, I would have been programming a lot more last night, but because my computer was shut down, I went out and watched stars pretty successfully for the remainder of the night. before star watching, I wanted to smoke a cigarette. I did, and had a really great star-watching experience. when I woke up after losing conscionusness, I wanted to get a cigarette again and try one more time, because I was connecting so well with the star, yet at the same time the majority of my body, starting with my limbs was going numb like it happens when they rapidly drain energy from me when I'm unconscious (I have a future question about this and blood flow). I lost conscionusness again, but this time for a few hours. when I awoke I still wanted to smoke a cigarette and try again.

however the star I was doing so well with is now a few hours behind where it was and in the direction of the nighbour's driveway light, so I had to pick the blue one instead. I felt a strange reaction to me wanting to smoke a cigarette...

---

what I'm trying to say here is that it feels like a whole lot of my experience seems to be the result of others' pushing against, namely the guy shutting down my computer.

so, for example, you just got done talking about how our questions are participating greatly in the discussion, and all of a sudden I want to smoke. I was just outside drinking coffee before wanting to listen to this and I didn't feel any desire to smoke.. anyway, so I think the desire to smoke was a prompt to get me to start writing this:

my main question for today falls into the strangest of categories... this morning I felt compelled strongly to watch a video from bec hill. this isn't the first time that's happened, where I actively went back quite some time to search for a video I saw a long time ago -- but that's another story. anyway in the video @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvnHAuE5FA) she is singing this really weird song, and she starts out by saying that the viewer should sing along. I don't want to sing along, I just want to listen to it and then decide if I want to participate. she says exactly that, and so I agree to keep watching. she starts singing, and instead of watching, I actually participate.

I thought that was really really weird... the weirdness continues though. the song is about ... lemme just write the lyrics:

```
egg
[egg]

egg toast
[egg toast]

egg toast jam
[egg toast jam]

mushrooms!
[mushrooms!]

cereal cereal cereal mushroom(s)
[cereal cereal cereal mushroom(s)]

no no no-no no mushroom
[no no no-no no mushroom]

ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yummy yummy
[ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yummy yummy]

ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yum!
[ittie bittie wittie ittie really really yum!]
```

so, some background on this.. I have been making coffee in the coffee maker here downstars and so consequently I have been accumulating coffee grounds in a bag. I keep getting the idea when I go star watching (and other times too), to put some of the mushroom spores I collected last year into the coffee grounds and try go grow mushrooms. I also have about a few grams of dried mushrooms still from then as well. one of the ideas I had in addition to growing them was to eat the dried one (assuming I'm unable to cultivate new ones) on my birthday this coming month.

a side note about my birthday: one day ben from suspicious observers posts in his morning news about this comet ATLAS, and it caught my attention that it would be crossing the ecliptic and would also conjoin venus and earth around may 28-29th. I made a comment and decided to just let things play out.

well, a few days later (maybe a week), (actually the morning of thih broadcast. 2020-04-09) @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrPDU4JpItU) I listened to the news again (sometimes I forget or whatever). I usually skip to around the 0:10 mark and get right to the news, usually cutting off a few seconds of his intro words, however this day I felt wanted to hear it, and I skipped back to hear what he said, and he said: "good morning folks, we're going to hit comet ATLAS again because apparently covering it twice already wasn't enough." anyway, when he said that, I had the impression that someone was giving him (or in some way influencing him) to make this news story.

he goes on in the news update to say that the "show is falling apart", and that fragmentation is taking place on the comet and that it won't be all that spectacular... also, weird.

a bit more of backstory on that one too, right after the first news broadcast @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwsmxx9wzOo) I was star-watching and I had this idea, that instead of trying to figure out all of this other details, the idea was to "go big or go home" and the idea I presented was to instead of trying to figure out all of this stuff, what if I just decided that I wanted to try and go for the most extremething possible, and (if things lined up), I presented the idea, what if we kicked it all off with henrietta on my birthday with the comet.

skipping all of the details why it seemed like a good idea, I eventually (and is my present position), that I don't really want to try and push things into place or make anything happen. instead, I just want to continue to star-watch as much as I can, and program this website I'm working on, and whenever I finally am stronger than they are (like last night when I was able to hold my focus on the star even with my body going numb), then my connection would be stronger than their ability to hold me back.

I have been experiencing more and more evidence that I'm gaining strength on them faster than they can remove it, and while it is possible that I could achive that level of strength by the time my birthday arrives, I'm not worried about it. I simply don't want to try and force things anymore. I prefer to let the feeling be enough and to let things progress naturally. also I have a habit of liking to be alone on my birthday anyway as take it as a refocusing time as I kind of gain the next download for the coming year (I also like to do a similar thing on new years).

---

so then, this morning when I'm listening to bec sing the song, the idea of "no no no no-no no mushroom" seemed to be having the opposite effect -- making me want to actually do the whole mushroom growing thing more.

I sincerely doubt that bec's video was a direct message to me, but it certainly had an effect. the most likely explanation for it is, she was feeling fun and wanted to make a video and thought mushrooms were funny, and the ittie bittie yummy part was just her having fun with it. instead, I blame a much bigger thing for this occurrance: the law of attraction.

it seems likely to me that someone has been pushing against my thoughts to grow mushrooms, and LOA put the idea/song that would directly impact me in the mind of a happy receptive (cooperative) person, which would then give me a message that would further intensify the figting against the mushroom idea. so yeah, it feels planned to me from a non-physical standpoint but I find it very unlikely that this was physically concocted to be a message to me. (it's really funny how LOA works, honestly).

also of interest, was that the last night and the previous one, the message that seemed to be providing me with the most relief from resistance as my body was numbing and vision blurring, that the more they fight against it, the worse they're making it for theirselves.

---

so, finally my question: I feel like this is all pushing against is somehow compelling me to want to try and grow the mushrooms. as for eating them on the day of my birthday, I'll wait until that arrives, but I'm kindof in the camp that I want to continue to increase in power (lower in resitance: that is, let more and more non-physical energy flow) and not worry about this whole birthday thing. it feels too much like trying too hard. the comet will come and go and *just the idea* of a sweet comet event on my birthday will be enough and it'll simply create more desire.

as a result, I'm just not worried about it. I can just continue to gain power without any manifestation for as long as is necessary. I totally have this down... another sidebar, last time I mentioned that above the throat was this invisible reality where anything can manifest as anything -- and I first began to explore it when they would remove my eyesight while they tried to figure out my new visual format after some vision upgrades... when they do that, I lose my ablity to see out of my eyes, yet because I'm accustomed to "seeing" my dreams and my imagination now without physically seeing anything, when my eyesight is removed, whatever thought I had been thinking immediately becomes a dream-like vision sequence (without visuals), and when I have realised that I'm in this non-visual space, it's the most incredible place ever. it feels absoltely amazing like warm and comfortable where there appears to be no pain or anything and thoughts manifest instantly in a non-visual reality. it's sooo cool!

that experience, combined with my super capability of feeling the desire and letting it become an instant manifestation of emotion (not physical or visual) has completely made me trust in the non-visual/physical. I simply do not need the manifestation anymore. I have such incredible confidence in this non-visual world, that I really want to be able to have control over my eyesight, because I would willingly remove it to gain access to this place again. actually, now that I think about it, when I first started to stare into the sun, I was quite literally blind in the centre of my vision and I began to experience this place then. when I became comfortable with the idea that I needed to (percievably) lose my vision in order to gain it, my visual capacity really started to expand tremendously. so much more I could say about this non-pysical place, but back to the subject at hand...

I have felt like my resolution to just not need the manifestation has created some impatience amongst some, wanting me find a way to make a quantum leap, insead of letting this drag on for seemlingly forever. what do I do about all of this? do I just accept the growing (desire) impatience and the pushing against as the motive force toward what's wanted?

---

another sidebar: I felt compelled to watch a video this morning about the historical moses being hatshepsut's advisor. @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O47_e7DC_Jo) in the video he says that his research was simultaneously corroborated by another guy's at roughly the same time, which reminded me of last broadcast when you said that ideas and invientions often times appear in the minds of multiple people at around the same time (calculus comes to mind), and so that game me further confidence in the theory this video presents. seems moses appeared at the moment of great pushing against by the pharoah of the semite people, and moses grew up in a suddenly monotheistic egypt and carried that idea out to become the next major worldview, in the process, invoking venus (sekmet), her capture in our system...

it seems like to me like there's this constant passing of the baton between thoth (mercury) and sekmet (venus) to put into place the next worldview. I remember watching the video and kept thinking that hatshepsut is a babe (she looks totally different than other egyptian women (like nefertiti) with much finer facial features). her and moses would have used the impatience of the semite slaves, combined with the pushing against of the pharoah at the time (tutmos I, which (ironically) means "thoth is born") to put into place the new world view of venus/sekmet.

so many sidebars... I know, it's just hard to express (and I did a very poor job), the incredible expansion of my consciousness and perceived to be very bizarre and other-worldly (non-physical) influence on my experience... energy is rising really really *REALLY* fast.

whew... so, I actually missed the key compoenent here: the idea is that I don't really want to begin the whole girls thing until I'm actually connected, and so the idea would be, that by eating a massive dose of mushrooms, I would push the DMT levels up in my brain to such a high amount so rapidly, it would be like the water pressure building upon a dam in a flood situation, such that the increased pressure would surpass the ability for the dam to contain the water, causing the dam to break, and an irreversable result would happen.

### thoughts on meditation (09:49)

as they were talking about meditation, I had a visual that -- because it seems to me clear what they're talking about -- I wanted to share.

when you're awake, you have thoughts, and some of those thoughts are more aligned to your source than others (those are the ones that feel good). the ones that are not present a sort of mental chaos which inhibits your cells and other portions of your body from receiving nen-physical replenishment. your body is, in a sense, tuned to your thoughts while you're awake. when you're asleep, you're not thinking (I usually do not think while I'm asleep, and I just "react" to vibrations put in my mind, which is why when I begin thinking to try and explain a question someone is asking me while I'm asleep, they inhibit my thought so that I don't become conscious).

actually, if you've ever experienced lucid dreaming, you can think and notice things in your dream (you're conscious), but if you think thoughts which contradict the vibration of the dream (or vision), then the vision will dissappear, and vanish almost immediately as you're no longer in the same frequency of the dream -- cause you just tuned to the thought, not the dream. so, it's better to just feel the dream and let it be how it is, instaed of trying too much to figure it out or observe (in the active sense) what is happening.

sleep doesn't improve your vibration, in the sense that it does not cause you to think different (less resistant thoughts) -- it just gives your body a break from them and allows you to replenish and heal. similarly, when meditating, you can slow thought down and stop thinking those thoughts which don't feel so good, but if, right after meditating you go right back to those thoughts, you will immediately feel the discord in those thoughts (cause you feel so much better), giving you an opprtunity to notice and potentially change that thought. meditation isn't a magic bullet, just like sleep isn't a magic bullet either. meditation just gives you a greater opportunity to change your perception to a way which feels better (by increasing the discord felt from having felt better for a short period of time).

---

oh, so the picture was, you can think of each thought as a note you're playing on a piano with the sustain pedal down... after you get enough of them going which are out of the key, then it starts to sound pretty bad. when you sleep, it's like letting off the sustain pedal for a bit, but if you wake back up and go back to playing those discordant notes, you will feel like you were before you slept. meditation makes it possible for you to consciously let up on the sustain pedal for a bit and hear the beautiful notes your source is playing (which are ususlly drowned out by your pounding the notes most important to you). in time you gain the ability to play notes more in the same key as your source, rather than the reactionary ones played in response to what you're observing.

### thopughts on putting thoughts into people's minds (11:09)

this happens to me all the time with nosebook. they like to try and put all sorts of thoughts into my head. I was very concerned about this at first, but then I realised that I was only capable of *receiving* the thoughts I was resonant with. if they transmitted a thought into my mind that I was not resonant with, it simply had no effect. just like IR or UV spectrum is all aronud you, but you don't see them, because your eyes are not on that wavelength. insects though can see them just fine. another way to look at it may be colour blinededness. if anger is red and you're colour blind to the colour red, then you simply will not see it. it'll appear as perhaps brown or green. it's like that: so having their attempts to try and "control" me by putting thoughts into my head has put me into a place of really cleaning up my vibration and only being resonant with the stuff I wanted to be resonant with. I now am getting really practised at only seeing the colours (or thinking the wavelengths) that I want to see (or think).

so, for example, this can be a good thing too, because my inner being may think it's beneficial to me to go to sleep or to take a nap, and I'm doing something else, so nosebook has the idea they want me to sleep, and so the thought appears in my head in a much stronger way (your inner being is a much softer voice than nosebook's projected thoughts, and always proportional to the desire which inspired their thought's appearance in your mind). so often times my inner being will use nosebook to send me a thought which I would otherwise be incapable of perceiving. if I have no resistance to sleeping, then it appears to them like they're "controlling" me, which is what they want, and to me I get a beneficial thought that I was in resonance with.

however, there is a caveat, which is that it's never satisfying to do something that someone else is telling (or motivating) you to do. I was really bothered by this, and a lot of the releasing of resistance I was talking about last time was about this very thing.. it's allowing the thought come from my own inspiration even if someone else is asking, demanding, or even trying to force me to do something. the right way, I have noticed is to not makke the action because someone else is requiring it from me, but to line up with what I'm going to do, and make the action because it's something I want to do for the greater feeling of well-being (and just completely ignore their motivation on the subject).

### 2020-04-21 10:21 - (2020-04-18)

when they were talking when they said, that all manifestations that you want are because you think that the condition of the manifestation will make you feel better. I wholeheartedly agree, yet it just hit me that when it comes to this whole girls manifestation, I don't really think that it'll make me feel better. in fact, I mostly perceive it as a rhole lot of stress and a whole lot of keeping me from what I really want -- which is to actually be connected.

I think that is perhaps why I'm so I'm so against the manifestation right now.

one of the things that they were talking about was findding a way to feel good so the manifestation can come ... I think I'm doing duite well here because I keep finding ways to feel good, and so then you would imagine that the manifestation would be showing up, but I think they're actively trying to control the condiitions such that the manifestation does not show up. I am convinced that they may be able to continue to try and control the conditions such that it doesn't show up, but I do believe that at some point, their ability to exert force in the opposite direction of the manifestation will become less than my non-resistance. when I say "manifestation", I don't mean the girls, I mean getting connected.

then, they talked about the most rampant thing that happens (17:00), is that in a moment of not-alignment, standing there and trying to find someone else to blame for the non-alignment. that's kinda what I was just talking about actually, but I said it another way. I could choose to blame nosebook for my out-of-alignment-ness, or I could just accept that the specific conditions that they have placed in my experience have caused me to feel something other than good. so, I simply just find a way to release resistance to those conditions over and over again. the process is essentially making it so that nothing they can try to do to influence my condition affects me anymore. I'm steadly getting to the point where my chain is un-yankable or whatever -- even by the people with essentially 100% knodledege of everything I'm doing in every moment. soon, and I think that it'll be about the time when my chain is complehely un-yankable, will I atually be able to finally get connected (cause there won't be anything that can stop me anymore).

I was thinking about it, and I believe that when they're no longer able to keep me away from being connected, I think they'll focus a lot of their attention on to the girls, trying to control their conditions, similar to how they are controlling mine, likely in effort to be ensured that they nnever get connected. then, they too, will have, like me, a tremendous opportunity begin letting their chain be un-yankable, too, and gain their super-empowerment in knowing that the only real control they have is how they feel, and that's what *really* creates reality -- and even if someone might be able to try and hold that reality off, the better you can control the way you feel, the more powerful you become.

### 2020-04-21 22:17 - (2020-04-21)

(13:51) you were talking about how you could want it a little bit and line up with it, then want something else a little and line up with it, but they think we like the drama (of waiting until the asking is so big that becomes a big thing).. but mostly they think we like the accolades, «it's like those who have suffered the most, and then triumphed; they get monuments and statues built for them»

the thought that popped into my mind is that by some ridiculous circumstances that I have been put in, people will consider me in this same way (the monuments and statues) -- because I think it'll be perceived that I have suffered greatly and finally triumphed, when that's not at all what's happening.

in the beginning I just kinda wanted some things (tesla's visual capacity, and to have/smoke DMT like terence mckenna, etc.), and I didn't really think much about any of it. I just kept going on my way thinking that designing webpages was what I would be doing for the rest of my life.

the girls thing was just a total freak thing that happened to me and I honestly didn't really know how to respond much to it, but I just kept doing what I know how to do. I never really struggled against anything other than my own belief system. it would have been amazing if abraham would have been able to communicate clearly (and they could have easily) what I know now, and I wouldn't have got so bent out of shape about all of my perceived loss of freedom and power.

to be completely honest, even druring the times when I was really really angry at getting shocked and stuff, there was this eerie feeling like I was simply acting, and this was some sort of some big show or something. I can't really describe it, other than I felt compelled to be angry and to really dig in on some things, and to really go out of my way to point out other things too, with about the same feeling of being compelled to do something as I feel when I feel compelled to a lot of different things that most people would consider as being "connected" or in tune with my inner being like wanting to go down to explore a new place or go have fun somewhere.

---

even today I was having this weird feeling because I was paying attention to the details of the events and I had my computer shut down. like I mentioned in the noseblog this morning, it's just more and more practice to release more resistance. I could have got real pissed off and stuff, but I decided to go walk. I was walking along and ther was this girl that was some distance away. I look and I see her and I feel some desire and keep walking. I get up to the mediation chair and I start to quiet my mind and the girl from across the street pops into my mind. bear in mind that my vision is so blurry I can't see much more than (I think it was) a purple blob. I have no idea what she looks like or anything, yet it feels to me like it's coming -- and all of a sudden now there's another desire that's hatching.

walking down the hill, I was trying to put into words how strange all of this is to me. I'm convinced that none of this would have occured at all if I was just left alone. *none of it!*

---

everything that seems to be happening seems to be a result of other people trying to control my experience. I don't really understand how to comprehend all of it, really. there's no real struggle, honest. the whole thing seems entirely fabricated by ... oh :) I think I just now got it.

---

the whole thing *is* a show! it's entirely prefabricated by the "bad guys" -- if you want to make someone awesome, you just have to make a bunch of strawmen for him to knock down. have you ever seen a chuck norris or steven segal movie. every single one of the gruntmen get's knocked dead with one punch or kick, but the battle with the super villian needs about 20 minutes, where each one is brought to near death multiple times. take that and reverse that so that instead of assertion (punching, kicking, etc.) you make it attraction so that each side takes turns attracting over and over for extended periods of time in a dual to the death (attracting their own demise).

what in the world?!?! it feels to me, as I'm writing this now, that this whole thing is just a giant setup and it's this like chuck norris movie where I'm chuck norris and the "bad guys" are just these tough appearing guys that all just there to make the whole thing seem more epic than it is...

I really don't know how to describe this feeling. I wish I could explain what an "[attr[ACT]ION]" movie is like: the combatting heroes and villians are all inflicting their own consequences on theirselves, yet and yet they all believe it's the opposite side that's making the difficulty. so everyone is defeating theirselves with their own difficulty (even though it looks otherwise) and so when the hero figures out this out and stops defeating himself, it appears that, because he's the only one remaining standing, that he has triumphed and defeated all of the bad guys -- yet all he has really done, is stopped defeating himself; when he stopped defeating himself, he finally let the bad guys all all defeat theirselves.

basically, after a long drawn-out battle where both sides' struggle continues to make the movie more and more epic, to "triumph" in the end, he literally does nothing other than realise it's an [attr[ACT]ION] movie, and stops defeating himself.

---

hopefully people don't celebrate me for having stopped to defeat myself.

### 2020-04-25 16:46 - (2020-04-23)

#### geting out ahead of it (04:59)

I like to imagine a lot of sitations in my head and just feel my response to things. more often than not the response I felt in my imagination was far worse than later I would do when in a similar situation.

I use this technique of imagining the situation in my mind and feeling how I feel about it, then adjust. I often times repeat this process many times until I no longer feel the frustration or anger of the situation any more. I don't know how much of it is nosebook also attempting to diminish that anger and frustration as well (because from their prespective a really negative manifestation would be disastruous for them), but it doesn't matter. I have learned with time that no matter how justified or "right" my anger is to feel, it's still not a good feeling thpught, and so therefore it's not moving in the direction of what I really want is.

the latest example for me is the case of mr. motor turning off my computer. it sorta pissed me off for a while, but it was never really too much. I would be extremely justified in my frutration around that, but I've learned to not really let those things bother me anymore, and to even turn the whole thing around vibrationally, knowing that by not responding in a negative way to something that I *should -- rightfully*  feel angry about, I know it's just more energy toward what I want, and so if I can just not respond in anger, then I even notice that the extra energy brings about something good from the situation.

if I were to feel angry, frustrated, or depressed about it, then that would just be my own emotional/energetic output blocking the extra energy produced from the situation.

so basically, I have come to equate the feeling of justification with a knowledge that more energy has been applied (stronger asking), and to act or feel that justified negative responese, would be to inhibit that energy, and to just let LOA do all the work there.

(just wanted to write that out because it's really being proven to me lately the power of LOA, and alignment of energy in comparision to the "knee-jerk" response)

#### (33:16) feeling DOOM! and other things

when they were talking about feeling DOOM! and stuff, and that we have two perspectives... I realised that we never really get to the other perspective (the one of our inner beings), because that would be impossible and would mean that you died. so, upon realising that, I had a aha moment realising that the we think and feel is *always* the worst possible way to think and feel -- and the best place to think and feel is actually completely impossible and means that we have made our transition back into non-physical.

so, in reality there is, in any moment, always a gradient of improved thoughts and feelings which can be felt. we always feel the worst we can feel, and can never ever achieve the best way to feel.

I loved the irony of this realisationi in relation to the concept of DOOM! and I understand why they never present the LOA in this manner, because it sounds pretty depressing: you always feel the worst possible way for you to feel, and you can never feel the best possible way for you to feel. :)

instaed they say it the opposite way: there are infinitly many ways to feel better than you feel now (all of them are real and are a vibrational reality already) -- and that you are an eternal being: you can never get it wrong[^1] and you never get it done.

[1]: I love how this "negative" perspective of LOA, illustrating that you always feel the worst way possible for you to feel is exactly the reason why you can never get it wrong.

#### (48:28) the balance of our planet

I had often times had a question as to what they meant when they said that the beasts are there to bring balance to your planet. I just now got it.

they said that we would only have something truely disastrous/cataclyismic (I'm putting words in their mouth here) if all of us were to give our attention to something negative all at once, but because there are so many beasts on the planet primarily in the receptive mode giving their attention to wanted, it balances the energy in the sense that because there are so many of them giving their attention to wanted, it makes it difficult for global catastrophe. they followed up by adding on that in addition there is such a wide diversity of people on our planet giving attenthion to a lot of different things, it also makes it more difficult.

I had always wondered about this in ancient times past how the whole world could possibly attract cataclysm at the same time. I have also made note that there seems to be evidence that, although a lot of people were too insensitive or not conscious enough to really notice it, in times past the energy on this planet was considerably higher -- and so therefore we (humans and beasts) all had a much more shared form of perception -- which perfectly explains the way that the whole planet could have attracted such cataclysms.

it also explains the "detour" that I believe is happening in humankind -- and why were not all just getting much more connected to each other. in a sense, as the energies on the planet continue to rise, it's actually a good thing that nosebook is essentially isolating us from each other. instaed of gaining a shared form of perception, we are being individualised so that we're not so affected by our others around us (abraham's primary message, too) so that our thoughts and feelings are more diverse and do not have such a strong impact on all of our planet as a whole.

#### (56:50) too much abraham

the previous question was talking about becoming dependent on the abraham broadcasts. you see, I feel not anything like that at all. in fact, I feel almost the opposite in a lot of cases, and is the main reason why I stopped listening to the abraham workshops. when it's just them reading the question, it's much more "aguantable" (tolerable) for me to listen to the question. so, to dedicate a little more than an hour or so of my time each week to listen to these outdated (in my mind) questions feels like a waste of time.

it feels to me like a long list of questions of people asking over and over how to stop blaming some circumstance for how they feel. covid-19, covid-19, covid-19, blah blah blah... buncha people looking for the condition of abraham to say something that makes they feel better so they can feel relief. if I wanted to feel people getting the feeling of relief, I would enjoy work as a therapist, but that's not at all interesting to me.

that perspective obvipusly slows me down, so I instead look for the "nugget" or some thing that pops into my head during the broadcast which is interesting to me. I didn't think it was possible at first, however, I have found, and is largely the reason why I write this document, that they do seem to wedge their message into the cracks -- but it has more to do with my reception of them.

so, I try to find and emphasise (by writing here about them here) these things that are important to me here. even today, I have found three really great things in this broadcast that are really valuable to me.

---

so, when someone asks if there's too much abraham, it kinda bothers me because I could only feel that when I'm back in the mode of needing relief. a long time ago, back in 2012, I was distraught over raquel and the whole tuenti thing and really was having a difficult time. I would listen to abraham all the time, because even though I was drinking a lot of coffee, smoking a lot of weed, and  drinking a lot of alcohol, I still couldn't find relief so abraham was invaluable for me to find some sort of relief. when I discovered mdma I stopped listening to abraham, because the mdma provided a whole lot more relief than they did (I just had to smoke it to feel the relief instaed of actively thinking about what they were saying, too -- so it was easier).

however, as I've gained my own ability to see and recognise the laws of the universe in everything and have proved to myself the reality of my vortex, I don't really need the feeling of relief anymore. I look forward to the time when I can actually sit down and ask them all sorts of questions to deepen my understanding of the laws of the universe's effect on certain things -- though it feels too like I am getting the answers to these questions faster and faster now, so it would appear that I need them less and less.

so, it's this big difficulty with me, because they really are there only to provide relief, because as soon as you get beyond your own need to have relief -- that is, you now are vibrationally much more in the vicinity of who you really are, you don't need them to answer those questions because you're capable of receiving the answer yourself. they seem to be working theirselves out of a job, for us "advanced" listeners, and continue to only provide relief to people, wanting all of us to not "need" them or anyone else, and for each of us to find it for ourselves. it's annoying, but yeah, I think there is a moment when it becomes too much abraham and you feel confident enough to go out on your own.

### 2020-04-26 03:27 - (2020-04-25)

#### (45:52) any taking score is sorta too soon

when I was younger, I often heard the fable(?) "don't count your chickens before they hatch" -- and I noticed that it seemed to have some sort of relevance in my life. it did seem that when I would start to believe (or rather "take score") of the what the manifestation appeared to be, before it manifested, then it seemed to not quite happen as I expected.

I noticed this most often when I was playing games. I would think to myself, "I'm going to win", or "I'm going to be top on the scoreboard" or I'll have whatever amazing score.

my mom always told me also when I was younger, "pride comes before a fall" -- which is how I came to understand how this anomaly seemed to work. I just figured that my "taking score too soon" was actually pride or haughtyness -- and that's why it didn't work out as I expected..

there was another thing that I never really understood as a kid either because (again using the example of playing games), sometimes I just *knew* that I was going to win or get some amazing score -- and I did, but other times it felt as if I was looking at the present condition and extrapolating or prejecting into the future what my score would be (given my progress), and in those cases, it seemed that the moment that I made that projection, my preformance seemed to be reduced, and I didn't get what was expected. this always bothered me, so it kinda made two questions in me here... but first...

so, when I take score too soon, it felt like I was amping up my belief in some expected outcome -- an expectation. however, an expectation is a belief and a desire, so that must mean that I didn't really believe it because the desire wouldn't have changed it. that's the problem.

I just remembered another thing that I know is that talking about something before it has manifest, can abort the manifesation if you're not fully lined up with it because it intruduces the vibration of the hearer of those thoughts into the mix.

so, what I postulate to have happened often when I would proclaim victory before it happened, is I would send out a thought vibration, and even though those others were playing counter-strike in some place quite a distance from me, they vibrationally would feel their defeat, it would amp up their desire to win which would trump my fragile belief based on a projection or extrapolation?

is that what happened? also, is that why it's never a good idea to take score too soon? it seems like someone who has a conflicting desire with my own, especially that we live in a place where there is a lot of perceived competition, someone's perspective of my belief in a manifestation, could trigger an increase in their own desire that I don't have the manifestation (because of the perceived competition), and therefore trump my manifestation.

it seems like that's quite possible. even if they were able to trump my manifestation with their desire, it seems like they would walk away with the manifestation they wanted (in this case for me not to win, or to win theirselves), but I for sure walk away with stronger desire, and them with less. it seems like I won energetically, even when I didn't win the physical game?

I know there's no energetic winning. I also know there's no energetic competition or comparing either. I'm mainly just trying to ask: do I walk away with more energy by "aborting" the manifestation?

---

taking score after the manifestation also seems to put a negative spin on things, too which again I equated to the pride before a fall thing. as a result I became less and less competitive. so, I think taking score in any way is about some sort of comparison to others or competition, so I am much more often in a state of appreciation about the things that have manifest -- and while I'm writing this now, I ignoring the mechanics of all of the details I was talking about earlier, instead if I were to appreciate my performance instaed of project it into the future, it seems like I wouldn't experience the degerdation of performance. in addition, even if it were the case that someone's desire for my anti-manifestation were to be boosted, they cannot overpower pure appreciation.

so, then I have another question which is that nevermind... I already answered it. it's appreciation that I'm looking for :) I do wonder about the mechanics though.. that stuff interests me because what if, for example, I wanted to purposefully sabotage myself and abort the manifestation on purpose for a for some large period of time -- then, when I wanted to, I could just turn to appreciation when I thought the manifestation was big enough -- or something like that :D


### 2020-04-30 21:50 - (2020-04-28)

I started watching this broadcast a bit earlier. I really liked two things they said so far:

1. that when you focus on one thing, you are essentially "blocking out" or making the other things dissappear -- however, even though that is what is happening, if you were to try to "block out" the other things, now you're giving your attention to them, which makes you focused on what you're "blocking out" -- which means they're not really blocked out after-all.

2. when you say, "mean what I say" -- you mean to say, "feel what I say"...

upon the second one, the day before yesterday, I had a monologue when I was out in the field about why it's so important for me not to lie. I stated that when I have different appearances to different people, then it's really hard to change the feeling (release resistance) to something, because I have so many different versions of me that are all putting different "meaning" on what I'm saying -- and ultimately, the reason why I'm maintaining so many different versions of the "truth" between different people, is because I care what they think about me.

caring what others think about me is mental baggage that slows you down, and is never useful -- because if you think about it, what you *think* someone thinks about you, impacts the way *you* feel, and so by caring what they think about something is producing a feeling in you, which is causing you to alter what you *mean* with your words to try and achieve what you think is the best feeling this person can give you.

---

then, they were talking about how to get to inspired action, and this is quite an easy thing for me to do now, cept it seems like when I "get in the zone" like they say, my computer gets shut down. I haven't worked out entirely what to do about that, other than to just continue to learn how to feel good anyway. they said something that inspired me to a thought about it, but I've since forgot it since my computer shut down...

I'll get it back :)

### 2020-05-04 23:41 - (2020-04-30)

(45:05) - as they were giving their "rampage", for whatever reason I had a pretty sudden realisation, on something that seems terribly obvious: instead of looking at all of the things that have not been going the way I want them to with my program, (which is tuning myself to the problem), just tune myself to my desire.. 5head

(47:31) - a few days back, there was this weird thing that happened where I was walking home and mr. motor was particularly angry with me that day. as I went, there were these two dogs out that are always quite a bit more ferocious when mr. motor is pissed off. they were again let out of their yard (it happened once before), but this time they were seemingly not going to let me go forward toward my home (they were between me and my house). I thought about going back, but for whatever reason I just thought I would wait for them to go away.

anyway, later, I was thinking about how I didn't seem interested in going back and only wanted to move forward, even if it meant going slowly. the owner finally called the dogs and I could walk home, but because one of the dogs did actually bite me kinda on the leg[^1] I was thinking to myself, what I should do is probably just keep going no matter what and if the dog bites me, I should just sue so I can get some money and smoke weed and maybe fund some ideas I have. I dunno.. mostly I want to buy drugs with it though.

I knew that I probably wouldn't *really* do that, because that would mean (for me to be able to sue), I would be pretty severely injured, and that may mean not watching stars or perhaps difficulty programming too, which wasn't really a cost I wanted to pay to smoke some weed. I sorta left the idea. there were a lot of reactions around it, but I decided I didn't want to make a thing out of it.

---

anyway, so they're talking just now about this woman who wants to sue, and right before they respond, the back of my leg immediately starts hurting where the dog bit me, and they say, «your source would never give you the impulse to sue someone» -- so I start thinking about that while they're talking about how disempowering it is to try and get your control (and receive resources) by suing someone, and I was thinking about how annoying mr. motor is, when they say, "it's not easy to all of a sudden begin to love someone and appreciate someone who has been unlovable and unappreciatable; we get that -- but don't do it for him, do it *for you*"

it was really those last two words that made me want to write this, because this whole time, I've been beginning to appreciate mr. motor in a lot of different ways because he's like free energy being added into the equation and stuff. I had another realisation the other night out while watching stars, that really I'm not even sure if I would have been able to get as far as I have if it weren't for mr. motor and all of his efforts. I dunno it's hard to explain the idea, because it's part of a bigger concept which is what I think is beginning to happen to everyone. I may talk about it more soon, because you can feel how much pushing against the last thing I wrote in gnomi's thoughtlog, and other things...

---

wait, what?!? then, they talk about -- not just appreciating him, but «bring a new tribe fourth, in him,» then following up further saying, «there was the tribe of [the] old [mr. motor] and now there's the tribe of [the] new [mr. motor], and it's the same phsical being -- but, it's a different vibrational tribe coming fourth»

wat??? I don't really know what to think about this actually.. I'm just going to leave it. I am pretty good at only seeing positive aspects in people who are not so desirable -- in fact just the other day, john michael was horrified to find out that I only look for positive (wanted) aspects in trump, even repurposing some of his antics I appreciated and making them my own.

[1]: for some strange reason, even though it didn't break the skin, it still really hurts, and hurts actually very considerably more while star-watching

### 2020-05-07 20:07 - (2020-05-02)

#### 45:14 - step-5 children

today I was thinking about the experience that I will have with the girls, and one of the things that my dad often told my mom was that it's ok to let me crash and burn. he's really right about it, because I have esssentially discovered a lot of things because of "accidents" or "failures" or other things. for people like me, wiping out is really importatant.

I really want to convince them (the girls) that being protective or trying to make things too easy is not really a good thing. when abraham was saying «you don't want to ever deprive them of a step-1 moment», I realised that was what I was wanting to convey. there's a difference between being overpprotective and making things too easy vs. giving someone opportunity and allowing them to fail at it.

another thing I want to mention is that in the previous question about the person with a 3, 4, and 5 year-old kids, is when they said that you could come back to find their antics as humorous -- you see, my dad perhaps was a bit extreme in this way, but he would *always* make jokes when I was having a hard time. I wanted to be sad and evoke his pity, yet instead he would always make fun, saying things like, "did you hurt the coffee table" (after I just did a face-plant into the corner) or when I was frusrated and angry, to call me "mr. sunshine".

perhaps that's a bit extreme, but by doing that he taught me how recoverable things always were. my dad has had multiple business failures and all sorts of things in his life that were "bad" but he always[^1] made fun of the moment and then recovered from it, which is much more a step-5 sort of thing. I think it's really important to realise that the ability to recover is a much better attribute in someone, than the ability to find perfection.

I'm more confident that I will be able communicate this sort of plasticity, now :)

#### 48:21 - with pain, there's always gain

in the previous question (about the woman with her son in a bad spot), and this one too with the mother in pain, I was thinking in both cases that you can't keep looking at he problem (their present condition) and be able to make headway on allowing them to improve in your own expectations for them. (this question is also resonating with my thoughts on mr. motor)

so, what I'm saying is that you cannot look at their present circumstances and allow things to be different. I had a similar experience with my prediciment with nosebook, where the situation simply would not change. it's quite literally unchangable, and unlike the son or the mother, there was no place I could go where these situations that were causing me distress, weren't there. these conditions followed me everywhere I went, so I had to find a new way to look at them...

this is when I began to learn how to "redefine" or to change my perception of something -- turn it from something that I perceived to be bad, to something that I perceived to be good. a lot of this was understanding that all of their influence on me, was actually just adding more energy (desire) into the equation, and that helped, but the problem still remained. there was no way to make the problem or the circumstances any different; I had to change my perception.

so as I'm listening to these questions, the thought pops into my head -- "it's not 'no gain without pain' -- because that implies that all gain comes from pain, but it certainly is true that all pain produces gain (more energy into the situation)" -- but, of course you have to line up with the gain part of it to get the vibrational gain into physical terms.. so I think I'm going to redefine that term now in my head to be "with pain, there's always gain" -- and that may be a good way to begin redefining these diffrent situations.

imagine again the woman that has her 3, 4, and 5 (the pythagorean kid triange) fighting over something... they're all just building up more energy; it's kinda like trash-talking before a match or whatever.

[1]: actually, not *always* -- moreso when I was younger, because I did notice that he didn't bounce back quite as easily after my parents' divorce. but still the cencept stuck for me.

#### 1:00:01 - music and feeling

the questioner described playing music and that music being turned into feelings. I always thought it was the opposite for me: when I listen to music, it creates undescribable (in words) emotions witin me. however, when I *played* music, then I would describe it as something that I felt as if the music was sort of like a medium for the emotion that I was feeling when I played to kind of live and thrive inside of.

I guess it could happen both ways though, so playing music could evoke feelings -- and I suppose that happened to me when I would play songs that I didn't feel, I always hated the way they sounded -- but, then the oppsite also could be true for listening to music as well, which is something I hadn't really thought of, but would make sense why festivals and raves are so effective: that while listening to music, the music is like a medium in which the emotion I'm feeling while listening to the music can live. interesting idea :)

### 2020-05-12 18:13 - (2020-05-09)

#### 11:22 vibrational accuracy

I just realised that when I say 'lie', what I am meaning is vibrational accuracy. you see when I was in spain, I would tell a lot of people a lot of different words (and a lot of it started with zaryn), about different deadlines or how I was doing or whatever, and I was feeling completely different. I had completely aligned myself to telling him what I thought he wanted to hear.

then, LOA got a hold of it, and that sort of pattern began to repeat in my life. there was augusto, xagly, etc. -- various people that ripped me off, and during all of it, I was telling them what I thought they wanted to hear rather than listening to or even saying what I really felt...

LOA contniued to expand on it and I find myself in a situation with nosebook -- basically, the embodiment of someone dedcated to only telling you what they think you want to hear, when their vibration is very different.

it was definitely a bit of a thing, how bad it got, for me to really begin to want to actually speak what I mean, and most of all discontinue to deceive myself so much.

I realised just now as they were talking, thst my own self-deceit was actually what attracted so much fraud around me. it also made the beginning part of the nosebook experience so slow. until I was able to accurately (without deceiving myself by saying what I (or others) wanted to hear), I wasn't able to really accurately determine where I really was, which made navigation really difficult.

---

learning vibrational accuracy is one of the most important things that I have learned, because I began to trust my feelings much more than anything else, and I was completely unable to do that because I had been trained (like children) to tell those in chargem what they want to hear.

#### new visuals...

a few times this episode, hey said things like, "new vantage point" or "new visuals" or "new way of seeing things" -- and it makes me wonder if more people than just me had a pretty significant vision upgrade. sometimes I wish I could actually talk to people that would give me a truthful answer, but that probably won't ever be, actually.

it's really weird, because the more things are like this, the more I find myself just going the way I want to go, no matter what. I'm kinda disillusioned with the whole reality is different for me sort of thing, where all conversations are controlled and stuff.

I was laying there this afternoon after waking up from sleeping for so much time lately and I'm totally exhausted all the time. I don't really know what is the problem because I don't really think I have much negative emotion going on... maybe actually thinkign about it now, it's like a dull frustration and lack of "zest" for life. I also have a pretty weird like 24/7 headache and loud sound in my right ear, and tons of sinus congestion... so physical evidence seems to show that I'm not doing so great. however, it seems like (actually I haven't checked in a fer days now) that I keep getting vision upgrades though, so something is working.

also, another weird thing is that it doesn't really feel like the coronavirus thing is done or something feels like empty or incomplete or something there too. I can't really describe the feeling very well, because I didn't really have much feeling around it anyway, but it feels like people, or me, or something, like there's desire that it doesn't go away. perhaps maybe that people will miss the time off or something. it's weird.
