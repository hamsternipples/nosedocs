I have been thinking a bit about what sort of effect parents having access to their children's eyes and thoughts will be. I postulate that it will produce two major extremes: 1. performers concerned with their appearance and 2. shameless non-conformists.

let's begin by taking a look at my first archetype which I will call performance/appearance, and begin with a scenario of a more "macho" type kid and his father. let's say the kid plays football and the father takes pleasure reviewing his kids plays on the field in such a way that the father is proud of his son. this is pretty positive feedback that the kid will feel during the game, as his father is essentially rooting for him and transmitting positive feeling along with his son's success. essentially, the father's positive expectation of his son's success on the field, means it will be easier for him to score. the better he performs, the greater the expectation, and the greater the expectation, the better he performs.

this circular feedback loop works well for physical activities pretty well, because what his son is thinking during the activity is pretty irrelevant to the overall success. now, the game is over and his son is in a social situation with some girls. his dad turns on his son's thoughts cause he wants to see how well his son is at hooking up with this girl he's talking to.

again, I imagine that expectation has a lot of influence here so as long as his dad thinks his son is some sort of casa-nova legend, it could work out well as long as his dad is a good observer, but as soon as his dad starts analysing his sons thoughts, his opinion will kind of mess things up a bit energetically. it will be much harder for his son to feel the girl's feedback. one wrong move or thought (in the eyes of his father) could project a negative feeling out there and since he's already trying to perform in accordance with what the girl is projecting in response to his actions, this could create some confusion.

what I'm trying to get at here is that, in my humble experience, the observer's expectations of the target can be ruined much easier when the target's thoughts are also observed. to illustrate the point, imagine a super smooth romance scene in a movie. in the movie, the person's thoughts are not usually revealed, and when they are, it is usually to grant more awkwardness to the scene. so, we know that the super smooth romance scene turns out well, and everything works out, but in the guy's mind he could be completely terrified and kind of talking himself through the situation and just sort of reacting in the moment -- or it could be like some sort of trained exercise where no second-judging is happening. we don't know as the movie audience member so we're free to imagine whatever we want going on in the actor's mind. that's why movies are so nice: they provide little enough information that you can be an observer, but not so much that you become an analyst.

let's say though that the guy is a total wreck on the inside, yet manages to pull it together enough to kinda pull it off. if you knew what was going on in his head the movie would be in my opinion much less fun to watch (unless of course you like watching train-wrecks turning out ok type movies) I would like to argue that train wreck would be exacerbated much more if the guy in the movie were able to feel the audience's reaction to his train of thought. the sort of situation where things are pretty touch-and-go yet sort of (hopefully) come together in the end is, (in my opinion) pretty typical for any kid looking for some sort of romance without having any prior experience.

back to

shameless/non-conformist
performance/appearance

shameless != worried about appearance
non-conformist != performer

(a shameless non-conformist doesn't need to look a certain way or try to perform for others in a way which will win the approval of others, to be able to feel good about oneself)

both generate more self-centredness (but different paths)
